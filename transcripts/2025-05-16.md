[00:00:00] Speaker 1: So, I'm not real much. (dramatic music) Oh, what the hell?

[00:00:08] Speaker 2: (laughs)

[00:00:09] Speaker 1: I think not.

[00:00:10] Speaker 3: Wow. That should be okay. (door opening and closing)

[00:00:26] Speaker 1: Thank you. (dramatic music) Oh, we're going from here. Ready?

[00:00:42] Speaker 2: It's, it's downloading the thing, which is taking forever.

[00:00:44] Speaker 1: Okay. Long as you get.

[00:00:44] Speaker 2: Oh, it's almost ready.

[00:00:45] Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, hero points.

[00:00:46] Speaker 2: Yep. I need more. (dice rolling) And the only reason I have this thing tonight is to be the time keeper. All right. What is today?

[00:00:49] Speaker 4: 16th.

[00:00:49] Speaker 1: September 16th, 2025. All right, it is recording. Okay. Our story begins... And any story in Subterra, you know, inevitably does, with a, uh, Norse man getting on a boat. Uh-huh. Just like that. So you're a character and (laughs)-

[00:00:54] Speaker 5: (laughs)

[00:00:55] Speaker 1: ... you guys now know you're gonna play this man. Um, now one thing I'll point out, actually I forgot I should mention this, your guys' characters haven't met. And as I mentioned kind of in the email, you know, there's not gonna be any moment where you're sitting around, you know, com- playing charac- or, you know, going over your characters. This is not, you know, everyone telling me your backstory and everyone what skills you have and whatnot. So, whatever you have, do it through role playing. Um, if you notice someone is hinting at something, like if they have a cane and they're limping, you know, feel free to ask other things about other characters. Um, stuff like that. So you kind of learn more organically about each other. At any rate, you're getting on a boat, um, in Ni. (dramatic music) So, uh, the Norn are from here in Solstheim. Um, you're getting on a boat. And as you're, uh, it's, it's a fairly decent, you know, Norse, uh, Norn trading boat. Um, and you are headed, uh, kind of to this area right here. There's a little Dwarven kind of s- uh, Memphold Daroth is the name of the little port you're trading to. Um, you're headed over there. On the boat, it's mostly Norn. You can tell they're mostly sailors. Um, it's, uh, it's a lot of Norn grain that's being transported. But you do notice one other person that's obviously a passenger. Wait, it looks like that.

[00:03:42] Speaker 4: I should go-

[00:03:43] Speaker 5: Oh, hey. Can you turn them so Irv can see?

[00:03:45] Speaker 2: All right. Well, I guess Irv recognizes that one, possibly. (laughs)

[00:03:49] Speaker 1: Um, here, it might help if I do something like this. Okay, he can't see too much here, but... like that. Make sure we've done it. Maybe, yeah.

[00:04:09] Speaker 5: Pay no attention to the words at the top?

[00:04:11] Speaker 1: Yeah. Only what's, uh... Oh, we have-

[00:04:13] Speaker 4: I can't even read it from here, honestly.

[00:04:15] Speaker 1: (laughs) She has a name. (laughs)

[00:04:17] Speaker 5: Mm-hmm.

[00:04:17] Speaker 1: I guess now you can say anything that you want to. She's like, she's kind of, um, fairly rich. Um, well, well off, is wearing nice armor, has nice swords, rapiers, et cetera. Probably human of, as you're guessing, probably noble line or, uh, of wealth of some sort. Um, you can say anything if you want to, otherwise the boat's just gonna set off and you're gonna make your way to the, uh, Dwarven place. So if you want to say anything to her, this is the opportunity. Um, this is how everyone's coming together, so.

[00:04:50] Speaker 6: Arnor's fairly friendly. He would greet just about everybody, especially if it's gonna be sailing with him, um, introducing himself and, uh, asking if anyone wants to play some dice if they're not otherwise engaged.

[00:05:11] Speaker 1: Oh, yeah. This is, these are hardened sailors. So once, uh, everything's settled down, um, they'll more than likely, you know, um, yeah, definitely take some, uh, place in some dice games. Does your character have provisions or skill in that, or just the type of set?

[00:05:27] Speaker 6: I'm gonna set a dice.

[00:05:27] Speaker 1: I can't remember if, um...

[00:05:30] Speaker 6: And he enjoys it. (laughs)

[00:05:32] Speaker 1: Um, so you do that, you pass the days away. It does take you a few days. This is a Norn boat, so it does have some sails, but it still is gonna take you a few days to get there. Um, you make your way over, uh, and while you're sailing, uh, you... another, uh, member of our... oh, yeah, maybe I should put up miniatures too, as I do this. It's coming from a different direction of our party. Looks like this.

[00:06:02] Speaker 4: All right.

[00:06:03] Speaker 5: (laughs)

[00:06:04] Speaker 4: Is that a person?

[00:06:06] Speaker 1: And-In your case, you're... From the bigger map, Chengdu is kind of this region over here. Um, this is where the Jade Kingdoms are, um, where your character has been slowly winding his way, um, up on his, uh, quest or journey. Um, you've passed through, you see many, uh, things. The Jade Kingdoms is a ton, a bunch of small little kingdoms, but it's very much like China, Japan, Korea. And you get kind of a feel for what that is. The, um... Your character is midway through. You've been joining a trade caravan eventually, 'cause it's, it's a dangerous place still and you don't wanna be by yourself. So, as you're traveling, um, again you're part of a caravan. Mostly, hardened, you know, dedicated mercenaries and, and whatnot. But you do have a gentleman that's also joined you, who looks like that.

[00:06:56] Speaker 7: Oh, god.

[00:06:57] Speaker 8: (coughs)

[00:06:58] Speaker 1: Of a very nice gentleman.

[00:07:01] Speaker 9: Oh.

[00:07:01] Speaker 8: Older gentleman.

[00:07:04] Speaker 1: Um, he is fairly older, um, just like that. You may have eventually learned his name is Lynn. He, he sits there and talks to everyone and he's very personable. Um, he knows... He does have a nice staff just like yours, strangely enough. He's older and he seems like he has a lot of religious charms on him, but you may suspect that... I mean, if you're going to have a staff like that which is used for fighting, you, you suspect he may know how to use it, though he doesn't look like any of the monks that, you know, there were, there are Kung Fu monks you probably met on your journey. He definitely is not like them, though. So, kind of odd, but... Your journey also takes a few weeks. You can talk to them or if there's anything you wanna do.

[00:07:42] Speaker 7: I would occasionally make conversation if, if somebody else initiated it.

[00:07:49] Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

[00:07:49] Speaker 7: But otherwise not.

[00:07:51] Speaker 1: Oh, okay. Um, they'll... They talk and whatnot with you, but generally speaking a lot of the days is pretty much... When you're going through from one city to the next, everyone is like on high alert the entire way. And this is true for all of you guys as you travel throughout this world. Most of your caravans of what I call high alert, even on the high seas. It's still... There's a ton of sea monsters and other stuff that can get you, so it's still kind of a very tense thing. And there's... Really, when you're at night, when you're in a resting place, that's about the only time you have a chance to rest up and, um, recuperate. And that's when many of the social stuff happens. Um, the people will all look at you kind of odd. Um, some of them more so than others. Um, the gentleman here, you can notice, Lynn, at some point, just comes over and, you know, says, "Hi, how are you doing?" He offers you some tea and some other stuff and says, "We don't see many of your kind, uh, coming through here." But, uh-

[00:08:47] Speaker 7: I, I am called Kotal.

[00:08:50] Speaker 1: He says, "Well, well met. Um, I am Lynn. You are on this, uh, journey for sightseeing, I guess?"

[00:08:59] Speaker 7: Uh, hmm. No, we don't. You pick a fun name to pronounce. Uh, Zapotlatena.

[00:09:10] Speaker 1: (laughs) Sorry.

[00:09:11] Speaker 7: Breathe. Zapotlatena's breath ca- carried me here to trace a line carved in stone, a line that ends somewhere beyond. Until I reach it, my journey and yours align.

[00:09:22] Speaker 1: Ah. Well, that should be good. Um, he's a little... He's not entirely sure of your deity off the top of his head, because he's not used to her by that name. Of course, it-

[00:09:30] Speaker 7: Zapotlatena is known to, uh, you, I believe, as Gaia.

[00:09:34] Speaker 1: Oh, yes. Yes. Um, he is... Um, she is indeed one of the, the Buddha, um, maybe one of the higher ones of deities. Um, the, uh, Eastern religion is very much like, um... I think they're called Taoism in this game, but it's very much like, uh, Confucianism and, uh, or maybe it's Confucianism and Buddhism, so she would definitely be a re- uh, deity of the origin. Coincidentally, the names I gave you for those are actually real deities from Mesoamerican. I think that's... I think she was Incan.

[00:10:03] Speaker 7: Oughta figure.

[00:10:04] Speaker 1: She's Incan or Aztec.

[00:10:05] Speaker 7: ChatGPT helped me pronounce it and correctly recognized that it was Aztec sounding.

[00:10:09] Speaker 1: Oh, and by the way, if you wanna look at your particular miniature, that's yours there, and then this. I still haven't... Could you just be a little careful with these? I haven't sealed them yet, so if you have greasy hands or anything... That's not the best seal it looks like. Um, so you continue on your journey. Um, then we get to our next, uh, character who's waiting, um, patiently, impatiently. Um, looks like that. All right.

[00:10:37] Speaker 10: Pretty patiently.

[00:10:38] Speaker 1: (laughs) In the city of, um, the name I cannot... I basically Googled, uh, (laughs) uh, Duergar cities and that's what they came up with. It's actually from, uh, whatchamacallit?

[00:10:53] Speaker 10: Forgotten Realms?

[00:10:54] Speaker 1: Yeah. Menoth-Derith. Derith. Um, you've been waiting there, um, perhaps... Y- yes, it's a newer city, definitely. Now, your homelands are, um, Unek-Melzuen is just right over there. This is basically a small trading hub. Um, if you guys look at the bigger map... Well, we'll get to that in a moment, I suppose, but... But you've been waiting there for a few days since, um... Most of the people there... It's, it's a port, but it's a very, very new port. Probably within the last decade that it's been built. Still letting people move in. It has kind of that Wild West feel to it, where just new buildings are finally being set up. Um, it was fairly well built. It, it has a very nice defensible location. Um, I don't know if your character might... I think your character has some sea knowledge or seafaring background.

[00:11:43] Speaker 10: Yeah, so he would, 'cause he's from an island.

[00:11:45] Speaker 1: All right. So you probably would've... You, you would know that it's, uh, uh, was selected because of its defendability, both from the sea and from land. Though, that doesn't mean it's an easy city to be in. It's, you know, kind of built into the cliffs and whatnot. But it'll be a good port city once it gets, um, fully built. Um, but yeah, it's mostly... The people you have there are mostly traders, some of the families that run it. But you're, you know-You could probably find stuff to keep you busy.

[00:12:13] Speaker 11: Mm-hmm.

[00:12:13] Speaker 1: Um, before too many days, um, happen, uh, come, I don't know how long we're saying you're waiting there, but you do have some troops that, uh, start moving in. Um, eventually you start finding that they are forming a caravan that's gonna be heading east. Um, and, uh, a, a ship sails in, a Norn ship. Um, there is still a little enmity between the Norn-

[00:12:35] Speaker 11: Yeah, I was gonna say. (laughs)

[00:12:37] Speaker 1: Um, they, they do, there's a big grudging respect between the two. Um, they have, um... Now, dwarves are known to hold grudges more than Norn are, but, um, in the decades that followed, uh, basically the Norn and the, uh, the Norn from Solstheim and, um, the dwarves from Uknopan Du Nn, they were, um...

[00:12:59] Speaker 11: (clicks tongue)

[00:12:59] Speaker 1: There was a period known as the Norn Terror or the Norn Raids, which I know some of you guys have given some lore on, where they had, um... The Norn had been raiding everywhere. It was hu- actually cataclysmic wh- for some people. Um, they raided a lot into the Iron Kingdoms in particular, but they also, being a very heavily sea-faring people with the dwarves and the Jade Kingdoms, um, all throughout this entire... I don't have a full map here, but, um, I can pull up maybe. But they raid all throughout the place, that's known as the Norn Terror. Oh, eventually it ends, um, and, but because the Norn had discovered so much stuff and resources, minerals, they'd sailed far and wide, that really spurs a lot of the other races into start, now starting to branch out and explore. But yeah, there's still a little enmity. They're both sailors and they, they, both Norn and Duergar will serve on the same boats, um, 'cause they are both very skilled sailors. And they do trade with each other. But, you know, it's kinda like packers and bears, the... (laughs) And they never go away.

[00:14:01] Speaker 11: Mm-hmm.

[00:14:01] Speaker 1: But you do see, um, a Norn, uh, step off the boat, about so like that. And a human, uh, that looks like that.

[00:14:08] Speaker 11: Mm-hmm.

[00:14:08] Speaker 1: Before too long, you do hear that they also are inquiring about, um, heading east. Or west, yeah, you guys can't go east from where you're at.

[00:14:17] Speaker 11: Mm-hmm.

[00:14:17] Speaker 1: I mean, you could, but that'd be weird.

[00:14:20] Speaker 12: Go to my hometown, maybe? (laughs)

[00:14:22] Speaker 1: (laughs) Your character, by the way, looks like that. Uh, the hammer I didn't quite like and I may replace, but...

[00:14:28] Speaker 11: Yeah. Looks cool.

[00:14:29] Speaker 1: It's an, uh, it's more of a stone hammer, when you think about it.

[00:14:32] Speaker 12: Okay.

[00:14:32] Speaker 1: So, hammer, hammer, Dwarven hammer. But... Yeah, that was one other ones where... otherwise bad, so.

[00:14:43] Speaker 11: Mm-hmm.

[00:14:43] Speaker 1: Um, and then maybe another, after another day or two, a caravan arrives, um, with, uh, two more folks. Um, a Slann and then a gentleman from the, uh, uh, Iron Kingdoms. Or sorry, Jade Kingdoms. And they all, the two are also interested in joining the caravan. So, you guys do see each other and meet each other for the first time as the caravan leader, um, gets you there. Mostly, uh, the people who... Peatan comes and explains, you know, "Hello, welcome, I hear you're gonna be accompanying us. (instrumental music) I know little about you, but, um, you're welcome to join our-"

[00:15:20] Speaker 12: Who's talking? Sorry.

[00:15:20] Speaker 1: "... caravan." This is like the caravan leader.

[00:15:22] Speaker 12: Okay.

[00:15:22] Speaker 1: Doesn't really have a specific name, Red Shirt Number One if you want.

[00:15:26] Speaker 12: Uh-oh.

[00:15:26] Speaker 1: Reddy Sure. Um, but, uh, "We're heading, I understand you are wishing to join our caravan."

[00:15:34] Speaker 12: "Yes, uh, I hear there's good fighting out west. Should be, uh, good time out there."

[00:15:40] Speaker 1: "Ah, yes, well we could definitely use one of your type." You guys all recognize someone, or, well, you recognize him.

[00:15:50] Speaker 12: Mm-hmm.

[00:15:50] Speaker 1: Not personally, but you can see that he's, I'm guessing, by the way he's dressed-

[00:15:55] Speaker 12: He's got some holy symbols on him.

[00:15:56] Speaker 1: Holy symbols and I'm guessing not wearing a lot of clothes?

[00:15:59] Speaker 12: Nope.

[00:16:00] Speaker 1: So for you guys, and this is fairly widespread, um, are pretty fam- have probably seen Dwarven Slayers in your king- in your kingdoms. Probably fairly rarely down by the Slann, but then again, they, they are, they get around.

[00:16:12] Speaker 13: They displayed their scars probably?

[00:16:14] Speaker 1: Yep.

[00:16:15] Speaker 11: Mm-hmm.

[00:16:15] Speaker 1: Um, part of it's like their courage in battle. Um, but yeah, they, every scar tells a story, they show off their fitness, their, you know. Right, so you guys know you're going with a slayer and that's, you know, not, not something to sneeze at. And you can tell from the other dwarves around, they're giving him some deference too. Um, he says, "Yes, I'd be more than glad to have one of your kind join us. Um, indeed, you are quite well-known."

[00:16:43] Speaker 12: "Oh, should be a good time indeed, I bet."

[00:16:48] Speaker 1: He, you know, looks around at the rest of you guys.

[00:16:49] Speaker 13: Hey, they're talking about you?

[00:16:51] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[00:16:51] Speaker 13: Oh, right.

[00:16:53] Speaker 12: I know, it's shocking, right? (laughs)

[00:16:55] Speaker 11: (laughs)

[00:16:57] Speaker 1: Slayers are one of the few, uh, very we- you know, you guys have probably seen them when your cities were in trouble. Yeah, they might have come by. Um, we haven't got to your character yet except for yours because you wouldn't see any slayers where you're from, but we'll get there.

[00:17:11] Speaker 13: Darn.

[00:17:12] Speaker 1: Um, but the rest of you, um, he welcomes and says, "Well, you may, uh, join us. Um, we have a certain deal with, um, those of your kind. You are not a mercenary as such, but, uh, you are not paid by us. But, um, we will give you free passage with us, um, and if we get, um," depending on your, where your, uh, landing you wish to go to, um... He looks around and is really asking, "Where is that, if I might ask?"

[00:17:44] Speaker 12: Hmm.

[00:17:45] Speaker 1: Give him Tegrim's Crossing.

[00:17:48] Speaker 11: Yeah.

[00:17:48] Speaker 14: It's like, I travel to Tegrim's Crossing.

[00:17:51] Speaker 1: Mm, he says, "Is that the rest for you guys?"

[00:17:55] Speaker 12: What a coincidence, stranger.

[00:17:56] Speaker 11: (clears throat)

[00:17:56] Speaker 12: Me as well.

[00:17:59] Speaker 15: I, uh, also head to Tegrim's Crossing for now, and then to parts unknown after potentially, we'll see, wherever the wind blows me.

[00:18:07] Speaker 1: Ah. Well, he says, "Well, um, I will hopefully make it worth your while." Um-I can give you a nominal bit of gold for joining us, at least that far. Uh, everyone who joins us ca- at caravan and pretty much everyone in these lands, it's, um, you know, if you're with us, you're... Essentially it's all hands on deck. Um, if, uh, creatures that we pass along the way, they don't care, they'll slaughter everyone. So either you fight with us or you die. So if you're joining us, as I said, all hands on deck. Um, what I would ask that you do, as you're not my regular mercenary type, um, I would have you, uh, take part in the, uh, rear guard, some of the fi- the re- the ends carts of our caravan, um, protecting the rears as we make our way down the road. And if we get to Tiko's Crossing without any problem, I will try to make it worth your while a little bit. I can at least give you at least five, maybe ten gold for the endeavor. Um, it will take us a few weeks to get there. (dramatic music) Do you have anything further that you require? I would buy it now. Um, otherwise we shall commence here, you know, in the morning, unless the shipments are ready.

[00:19:23] Speaker 16: Let me just look one more time at my gear. I think I've got everything I need.

[00:19:29] Speaker 1: So while you guys are getting, um, ready, um, another character that we have not really talked about yet has arrived at a different spot. It kind of looks like that. Right there. Uh, miniature looks like that. Put that down too. Um-

[00:19:53] Speaker 17: (coughs).

[00:19:54] Speaker 1: By the way if you guys want, since I haven't done any of the sealing on those, if you have any updates or things you wanna change on the miniatures, colors whatnot, let me know because I can still do updates before I, um... We can seal after. You can do it after you seal too but I'm not fully done with the work on those, but-

[00:20:09] Speaker 16: This looks awesome.

[00:20:10] Speaker 1: Some of it is kind of a rush job, but I think they turned out okay, except for the flush on the two humans that I did. Um, it was only okay on that. So at any rate-

[00:20:19] Speaker 16: Look at that muscular back. (laughs)

[00:20:22] Speaker 1: You've probably spent... Um, did you read the stuff I sent you on your character introduction stuff? Or maybe not. Oh, Katie.

[00:20:33] Speaker 18: I-

[00:20:33] Speaker 1: Oh.

[00:20:34] Speaker 18: I did read the character stuff on my back.

[00:20:36] Speaker 1: Oh.

[00:20:37] Speaker 18: Yeah.

[00:20:37] Speaker 1: So you made your way through, now this isn't really on the map. Um, you've kind of come through the mountains, um, the tunnels under the mountains, which are not really tunnels at this point. There's like one cavern beneath the next and they're slowly being built into a general road. There are people who are working on it. Um, a few of the people are willing to escort you, uh, to your... Um, there's a little, uh, in about this area, a-

[00:21:07] Speaker 18: More people of my kind?

[00:21:09] Speaker 1: What's that?

[00:21:10] Speaker 18: More people of my kind?

[00:21:11] Speaker 1: Yep. Um, they'll escort you. There's a little, uh... There's the road there. Uh, basically the tunnels are gonna interconnect with this road. You know it as the, um... Name of the road that I cannot, that I will always forget. I gave it a nice Norn name and I always forget.

[00:21:26] Speaker 18: Neda- Nedavalor trade route.

[00:21:28] Speaker 1: Yeah. Nedavalor trade route is what it's called.

[00:21:32] Speaker 18: Yeah.

[00:21:32] Speaker 1: Nil- Nedavalor, um, as many of you guys know, especially our Norn, it is the Norn name for this little sliver of land from here, you can even sense it has a name right there, um, between, that connects here. There is another trade route to the south of the kingdom. It's an older one, but it's also fraught with a lot of danger. So this one was built as a trader out between these two, particularly between the two dwarves. Actually, here, I can pull up a full map. Um, ba-dum-bum-bum. 1.4, where's the full one? Nope, not 1.4. 1.3. There we go. Like this. There is a, to the south, there is a trade route that connects Shangu to Avonlore which is where the Iron Kingdoms are. And the other dwarves are in this little area right there. Um, and there is a route that passes through here where your character, Earth, had come in. Um, the, uh, Nagashi, the, uh, they were just kind of like a snake-like people with the other people who actually sneak- speak Parseltongue, et cetera. Um, they're in this little area right there. Um, and it kind of goes through there. So there is a southern route. You guys are potentially in the northern route though. So you know the road's being built, it's, you're, this is gonna eventually connect to it which could be a boon to your people, um. But they take you, you've gone out of the tunnels, a few people will take you into a little, uh, caravan serai. Serai? I don't know if I pronounced that right.

[00:22:53] Speaker 18: Mm-hmm.

[00:22:54] Speaker 1: Um, and it's a lovely little empty... It's a fortified area, kind of like a rest stop, um. To a certain degree it's where caravans can rest up overnight with some fairly safe walls and whatnot. Um, it is however inhabited. And as the, uh, you know, your kind, some of the engineers, they, they, you know, got you here in one piece, they don't want to stick around. Um, so you know what I'm saying? Just, just wait here, you'll be fine. Hide, et cetera. But there'll be a caravan coming along in a few days.

[00:23:28] Speaker 17: Sure.

[00:23:28] Speaker 1: I think, sure. They really think there will be. So they leave you there, you know, by yourself and, uh, you know. It's fairly well set up but it's, it's really kind of creepy. There's a lot of, um, like goblin totems and other religious icono- uh, i- iconography all around it. Basically stuff that would scare off goblins and orcs because they're superstitious and stuff. They want, you know, stuff to kind of keep them at bay while you're not here. So what, you can either set up however you want to. I don't know if you have any thoughts on what you would do, being stuck by an, uh, abandoned at this point caravan serai.

[00:24:06] Speaker 18: Um, um, probably not.

[00:24:08] Speaker 1: Find it then.

[00:24:09] Speaker 18: Just leave stuff as is.

[00:24:11] Speaker 1: Oh.

[00:24:12] Speaker 18: Leave all the goblin totems up. (laughs)

[00:24:15] Speaker 1: So you can, um-Yeah, you probably want those up 'cause they are to scare off the goblins locally, so... So, you rest up or you, uh, stay in there. Your guys' caravan sets out the next day. Some of you have gotten everything you wanted to get at this point. Um, and for a few days, you guys travel. Um, it is, um, f- y- no one really communicates much while you're traveling because it's, uh, fairly dangerous. Um, you're constantly on guard. (instrumental music plays) You're constantly watching out. Every time you hear rustling in the jungle, um, or in the forest, um, there you're going, l- most of the road that yous goes through is very, um, fairly jungle, or, h- s- very forest. Um, basically they are just next, the mountain are very forested. As you get closer to the water, you start getting into plains. Um, very grassy plains. Now, the area, the, all you guys would know this, Tigran's Crossing is built on a river. The area, uh, east of Tigran's Crossing is predominantly, um, Orc territory. Orc and I mean Goblins are always not far behind the others there. Um, they are on the other side, well you guys aren't really from there on the other side, so I won't get into that. Kind of a character maybe, but... Um, uh, so you guys travel for a day or two, um, and at one point, you guys are traveling along in their carts and all of a sudden, the carts become attacked. Um, the caravans push through a herd of auroch, which are basically giant, um, they're kind of like bison, wooly bison. Um, they start headbutting the carts as you guys are passing through and trying to knock them over, um, deal damage to them. Most of the caravan's gotten through, but, uh, you know, people are trying to scare them off no matter the cam. And now it's approaching your guys' carts. Um, so, I'll gave, give you guys, three of you guys each, uh, round and you can fill in two rounds. Um, you can pick something you wanna do to try to scare them off. You guys will be seeing these kind of skill checks all throughout the campaign. For these first few sessions, I may give you guys some ideas of things you can do, but then as time goes on it'll be more, you know. You don't have to take what I'm saying obviously, but... So, but you can do a lot of different things. You can look at what your character, you know, skills they have. You could try intimidation to scare them off. You could try strength or melee attacks, maybe poke them with a spear. Um, if you have magic spells you wanna try to do that would have some effect in scaring them. Um, uh, survival if you're trying to, you know, nature of trying to communicate with them. Survival if you're trying to set a trap or something or snare that might, uh, trip them up. So, you have a little bit of, um, latitude with what you wanna do, so... I'll let you think for a second while I grab something here. Never have I put it in the... Ah, here it's waiting. There's a way of traveling, um, and, oh God, yeah, it was over here. Ah. Sure I thought I had nothing over there tonight. No there's some more, oh. Fresh off the printer, mostly. I still have to get it. Maybe I'll get a little bit of a bigger one. So you guys are, in this one, there's a few, kind of a caravan going through. You guys are... I have some stuff I can put in there that you guys can stand on.

[00:27:52] Speaker 19: You saying I'm short?

[00:27:55] Speaker 1: Well, unfortunately, I was hoping that thing would be big enough that I could c- well, you know, draw lines on it and then stand you guys up, but it doesn't fit. Now it is, you guys are traveling in a cart, so bear in mind if you're gonna do any attacks in there. Um, so three of you guys are in there. So Sylvia's... You guys can also, either Sylvia or Lynn will join you in your cart 'cause there's only room for... Well, one will be in the front. So if you guys have any preference on where you want them to stand. I need more... Oh, I forgot money. I'll have to get to that. So one of the mentions, I think forgot the positions if someone is willing to be the treasurer. We will be playing with campaign coins for this, uh, game. We'll get to that here maybe in a little, we'll paused briefly, but... So all coins will be handed out through actual campaign coins. Um, so if someone wants to be the treasurer and take over, you know, trading in and out the gold, we'll get to that, how that works and what we want here. Um, bring this down. Okay, so you guys, for scaring off Orc, what are your guys' thoughts? You guys each have one or two actions. We'll give, we'll start with the first action.

[00:29:15] Speaker 20: Well, if these feisty little critters... And I'll just take a swing with my maul, see if I can get a charge in one to just reconsider attacking us.

[00:29:24] Speaker 1: Oh, yeah. Yep, you can take an attack. Now, any attacks in the carts, things to hit you and things you're hitting back at will all be at a negative one 'cause a cart's kind of bouncy.

[00:29:33] Speaker 20: Mm-hmm.

[00:29:33] Speaker 1: Um, it is hard for both of you to kind of target each other.

[00:29:36] Speaker 20: That makes sense.

[00:29:37] Speaker 1: Yep, if you wanna go ahead and, um, make an attack roll there.

[00:29:41] Speaker 20: I'll take the first one. Okay, that is a 16 with minus one, so.

[00:29:47] Speaker 1: Okay. Um, you cr- crack one on the head. It's, uh, it definitely thinks twice. Um, it wasn't the most solid crack on the head, but you do manage to-

[00:29:55] Speaker 20: Mm-hmm.

[00:29:55] Speaker 1: ... at least land a good blow. You guys?

[00:29:58] Speaker 21: How fast is this caravan moving?

[00:29:59] Speaker 1: I mean, these are wagons.

[00:30:02] Speaker 19: It's not fast.

[00:30:02] Speaker 1: It's, no, it's not super fast, but it's, you definitely would not wanna hop off. You could, um-

[00:30:08] Speaker 19: Why wouldn't I wanna hop off?

[00:30:09] Speaker 22: (laughs)

[00:30:10] Speaker 1: You probably would get trampled, you think if you did it-

[00:30:13] Speaker 19: These are, um, these bison things are surrounding us, or?

[00:30:18] Speaker 1: Yeah, they're all this, like, no, this is, these are, yeah, auroch.

[00:30:21] Speaker 19: Okay, auroch, not orc. Yeah. Like the things from the temple.

[00:30:26] Speaker 7: ... the, the underground temple in Baldur's Gate 3.

[00:30:29] Speaker 1: Oh.

[00:30:29] Speaker 7: And, and Underdark, since you probably never got there 'cause you still have played it.

[00:30:32] Speaker 23: Ah. Such an awesome game.

[00:30:36] Speaker 24: I went to playlist.

[00:30:41] Speaker 1: All right. So these are animals?

[00:30:44] Speaker 7: Yep.

[00:30:45] Speaker 1: Giant bison, wooly bison.

[00:30:47] Speaker 7: Generally not known to be intelligent.

[00:30:49] Speaker 23: Mm.

[00:30:49] Speaker 7: They're just animalistic.

[00:30:51] Speaker 1: Yeah, animalistic. They're-

[00:30:52] Speaker 23: Isaac?

[00:30:53] Speaker 1: ... they're tough. They can be pretty aggressive. Oh, hey friend. Is this your first time seeing an orruck? They're a feisty little bison. They tend to just cram into caravans, trying to get food. You gotta chase 'em away as best you can. You are probably very familiar because they are very common in Solstheim. Okay. So far, you guys have one success against them. I'll give you a chance to... Mm.

[00:31:31] Speaker 23: Uh, I'll make an intimidation check to see if I can, uh...

[00:31:40] Speaker 7: I don't... Oh, do you have the, um... What's that glare ability?

[00:31:47] Speaker 23: Intimidate glare.

[00:31:47] Speaker 1: Intimidating glare?

[00:31:48] Speaker 7: Yeah.

[00:31:48] Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

[00:31:49] Speaker 7: Um, if you don't have that and you can shout at them, I think you'd get a penalty since you don't speak a language with them.

[00:31:54] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[00:31:54] Speaker 7: Um, but you-

[00:31:55] Speaker 1: Uh, I was, I was figuring intimidation as in me shouting and like-

[00:31:57] Speaker 7: Yeah. You can give it a try.

[00:31:59] Speaker 1: ... like, maybe.

[00:31:59] Speaker 7: Um, it's probably there's... It's a little harder since you don't have that ability, but...

[00:32:03] Speaker 23: All right. Sorry. I'm gonna start by using one of my astrology abilities that can, depending on how I roll on this, uh, give me a bonus. And it is actually gonna give me a penalty.

[00:32:17] Speaker 1: Oh.

[00:32:17] Speaker 23: So I rolled a one, so I have a minus one.

[00:32:20] Speaker 7: (laughs) Okay.

[00:32:21] Speaker 23: That's great. And I rolled a two, so...

[00:32:25] Speaker 1: (laughs)

[00:32:26] Speaker 23: I am not particularly intimidating-

[00:32:28] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[00:32:28] Speaker 23: ... apparently.

[00:32:29] Speaker 1: Um, um, you must have started flashing red, which, uh, wasn't the best color to, uh, show them. So yeah, they're, um, starting to headbutt the cart at them, but what's your bonus? Because I might even get crit fail.

[00:32:40] Speaker 23: Uh, probably is.

[00:32:42] Speaker 1: Oh.

[00:32:42] Speaker 23: It's gonna come out to a one total.

[00:32:44] Speaker 1: Okay. Yeah, that would be. So-

[00:32:45] Speaker 23: With the, with the minus one penalty I was under and then rolling a one.

[00:32:49] Speaker 1: Yeah, you have a plus two as well as intimidation.

[00:32:51] Speaker 23: I come out to a two.

[00:32:51] Speaker 1: So...

[00:32:52] Speaker 23: Yeah. It's gonna come-

[00:32:53] Speaker 1: So, unfortunately, yeah, it kind of egged them on a little bit more. Um, apparently your, your horoscope, you know, was, you know, check back later or whatever it is.

[00:33:02] Speaker 25: Oh, snap. Friend, what did you say to them?

[00:33:05] Speaker 1: He spoke Ork and, uh, it, uh-

[00:33:08] Speaker 25: Encouraged them.

[00:33:11] Speaker 7: You must not-

[00:33:11] Speaker 1: He insulted their mother.

[00:33:12] Speaker 7: You must not begrudge nature from doing what is natural.

[00:33:20] Speaker 25: Is it natural to attack a caravan?

[00:33:22] Speaker 24: Just for fun, can I get-

[00:33:23] Speaker 7: Who is to say they aren't attacking?

[00:33:24] Speaker 24: ... a glass of water?

[00:33:24] Speaker 7: They are just acting in their own nature.

[00:33:26] Speaker 1: Um, yeah. Give me a moment here.

[00:33:28] Speaker 7: I will pull the lute off of my back and begin strumming.

[00:33:33] Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

[00:33:33] Speaker 7: A calming tune.

[00:33:36] Speaker 1: You can see how that would work. Yeah.

[00:33:37] Speaker 26: And music can soothe the soul.

[00:33:39] Speaker 7: Calming, calming tune, it is. Well, perhaps it will, um, calm my, my, my traveling partners as well.

[00:33:50] Speaker 1: Is it an actual ability or a-

[00:33:52] Speaker 7: Yes.

[00:33:52] Speaker 1: ... name of a... Is it like a bard-like type song or is it just a-

[00:33:57] Speaker 7: No, it's just a... It's a... It's, it's called the Ashes of Orchard Queen. And it is the story of an orchard keeper's daughter who was crowned after curing a blight only to learn her potion drew life. Or, her potion drew life from the soil itself. It is, um, me- perhaps distracting you because it is an entrancing song.

[00:34:16] Speaker 1: (laughs)

[00:34:17] Speaker 24: (laughs)

[00:34:17] Speaker 7: But hopefully it is also calming this orruck.

[00:34:21] Speaker 1: Go ahead and... That is a seven.

[00:34:28] Speaker 7: Okay. Well, not a crit fail but...

[00:34:32] Speaker 1: (laughs)

[00:34:32] Speaker 7: You guys feel more calm but that actually kind of works against you guys a little bit. So yeah, they do continue headbutting the cart. Eventually it pulls away. They do damage some of the wheels, um.

[00:34:40] Speaker 24: Ow.

[00:34:41] Speaker 7: Incidentally, see? The wheel, it's damaged.

[00:34:43] Speaker 24: Oh.

[00:34:45] Speaker 1: Bad print. I have to fix that.

[00:34:46] Speaker 7: (laughs)

[00:34:47] Speaker 1: Um, they do rough up the cart quite a bit before they, they head off. Um, and you guys pass by their territory. They are very territorial animals and you guys probably went in the middle of their, you know, herd and they just got pissed off at you. So while that's happening, you are, um... They're basically traveling. You're m- standing by yourself in an abandoned, uh, uh, caravan seraphim. And, um, late one of the evenings you start hearing some noises. Um, you look out and you see three little creatures, um, kind of crawled under, uh, into the, uh, into this caravan seraphim. Um, you probably easily recognize them, um, as a type of goblin. Because they're very small. They're maybe only about maybe that big. Um, you probably would initially recognize them as what's generally referred to as a snotling, which is a very, very young goblin. Um, sometimes referred to as a git. Um, and they're snooping around, um, poo- peeking into everything. You think that eventually they will discover you with where they're just wandering poking into things. They'll probably uncover you. So you may have to do something or you could just choose to do nothing. Um, you have a number of things you could do. If you wanted to fight them, wouldn't be too hard. They're minute, you know, like a hit point apiece. Um, but you can decide how you want to do that. You could try to avoid them, you could do things to scare them off, you could talk to them. There's a bunch of different things you could do, so. See what your thoughts are and what you wanna... Actions you want to take.

[00:36:38] Speaker 27: Oh, yeah.

[00:36:39] Speaker 1: Just whatever you wanna do.

[00:36:41] Speaker 28: Oh, I thought this caravan hadn't reached there yet.

[00:36:43] Speaker 1: Oh, no. They haven't yet. You're alone in the Kharan Sarai and you have three little goblins that are wandering around.

[00:36:50] Speaker 28: Oh, great.

[00:36:52] Speaker 1: And like I said, they will eventually discover you with the way they're poking into everything. But you can... You're seeing them but obviously they can't... Haven't seen you yet.

[00:36:58] Speaker 28: But are, are no B- bad ones... Like, they're just mean and will attack anything on sight?

[00:37:03] Speaker 1: You can do a knowledge check if you want. Um, and there's two different knowledge checks. Um, so the way we're gonna handle knowledge checks in this game, too, I'm gonna point out, um, I'm gonna make... Typically I wanna stick to as much of the rules as possible today. I am gonna make one small adjustment to how we do knowledge checks. Um, with knowledge checks, you guys can... I'll probably get it posted somewhere. But I think people didn't do them as often, because you only get like one piece of... And it's generally like one very specific piece of information. So this time if you guys do a knowledge check, if you succeed I'm gen- gonna give you their name and some fluff about them, um, some of their background. Um, then if you... Depending if you get one or two pieces of information, you can say, um, you know, their strengths, which will give you, um... Maybe I'll give you, say, weaknesses. I'm gonna give you all their weaknesses and immunities in one go so it's not just one thing. Um, same thing if you get strengths, I'll give you everything that they're, you know, uh, good against. If you want their special attacks, I'll give you all their special attacks. If you want their combat, uh, viewpoint of them, which is basically like, um, in video games how you would con. I don't know what it's used to... Used to be called. But how... Where they are in relation to you as far as level, you could also ask for that.

[00:38:14] Speaker 28: Okay.

[00:38:14] Speaker 1: I won't tell you exact, but it can give you a good idea.

[00:38:17] Speaker 28: Uh, okay. What kind of nu- roll would this be? I have underworld lore.

[00:38:22] Speaker 1: So there are two different kinds you could roll here. Um, and you can roll both if you want. Um, why don't we start with, um, society, interestingly enough. Society and nature would be the two that you'd need.

[00:38:34] Speaker 28: Well, I'm not trained in nature, so it's-

[00:38:37] Speaker 1: You can still try, I suppose. But-

[00:38:39] Speaker 28: Secret or not secret?

[00:38:41] Speaker 1: Uh, technically it's secret. I'm gonna go pick a card there.

[00:38:44] Speaker 29: (rolls dice) 16 plus 6.

[00:38:48] Speaker 28: Mm-hmm.

[00:38:49] Speaker 1: Okay. For society?

[00:38:51] Speaker 28: Mm-hmm.

[00:38:51] Speaker 1: Um, and then if you wanna go get me the one for nature too. Let's see what you know on that.

[00:38:56] Speaker 28: 15 plus 2.

[00:38:59] Speaker 1: Oh. Weirdly enough, those are both good numbers. Um, I probably shouldn't say that but... Um, one other thing. I'm also... There's not going to be as much secret checks as I think I normally do. Um, only... It's only going to be in cases where you wouldn't know how good you're doing. So with things like picking a lock, I think if you're trained in picking locks, you would know if you're doing good or not. Even things like trying to convince someone, I think you could read their face and tell if you're doing a good job lying to them, or if they're just totally not buying it. I think you'd know, so... Um, okay. So in your case, you know two different things. You know that there are two different types of goblins, basically domesticated and feral. Um, most goblins are feral. Um, there have been, in recent times, goblins that are, um, not quite as feral. They live, um... They've been kind of quasi-domesticated, uh, is the only way to describe them. They're like the classic piezo goblins. Whereas the normal goblins... If you've ever seen Lord of the Rings when the hobbits are kidnapped, that's what most goblins look like. Um, the ones that are domesticated look more like the cute little piezo goblins with the football heads. Um, um, but the, um... You've probably seen some of the domesticated ones in the lands you're from. Um, they are sometimes servants. They tend to just live near by other societies. Some would say leeching, others would say coexisting, offering to do miscellaneous jobs here and there. You don't see them much in your lands because, um, your kind live almost entirely up in the trees. Um, the ground is a very dangerous thing. And goblins, even the domesticated ones, are not good climbers. They're very good burrowers and diggers, and good at running for cover. Not so good in trees, so any time they offer to help your people, they generally just fall out of the tree eventually and die. But, um...

[00:40:41] Speaker 29: (laughs)

[00:40:42] Speaker 1: But, um, you know that, that's, that's one type of goblin. These ones would, uh... From looking at it, look to be feral. You're not... You haven't really seen much b-... I mean, you know they exist. There are goblins in, um, uh, Astoria, but they're typically very... The feral ones are very, um, shy. They keep to themselves. They're the bottom of the food chain and almost everything, um, will attack them. They're known for being very, very vicious. Um, but unfortunately in Astoria, being vicious doesn't matter much, because half the monsters are undead. They don't care if they're vicious, which is why they don't really thrive that much in Astoria.

[00:41:20] Speaker 28: Um, I guess I'm going to just stay there and hide. But if they look like they're gonna attack me, I'm going to... Ready to attack back.

[00:41:36] Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, but eventually they come around. Um, and yeah, they do discover you eventually because they're poking into everything. Once, once a little guy sees you, he starts yelping and raising and standing up. And the other three, other two come over and they start yelping at you. They draw their little bony... I mean, they're, they're daggers, but they're like, you know, that long.

[00:41:53] Speaker 28: Mm-hmm.

[00:41:54] Speaker 1: Um, and yeah, it looks like they're either gonna try to stab you or bite you. So how would you like to deal with them?

[00:42:02] Speaker 28: Uh, I'm gonna attack back first.

[00:42:06] Speaker 1: Okay. You can attack them. So yeah, if you wanna just do an attack roll, we'll just do one for the whole plot. Like I said, they're really easy to kill

[00:42:11] Speaker 30: (rolls dice) Mm. 14 plus... Well, like 19.

[00:42:18] Speaker 1: Well, yeah. 19's more than enough. Um, so yeah, you don't have to roll for the dice. You easily can dispatch them before they get to you.

[00:42:24] Speaker 28: (laughs)

[00:42:25] Speaker 1: Um, so yeah, you manage to kill them off. Um, what do you choose to do? I mean, right now you have three little dead goblins. Um, you also know that vampire, and even dhampir, do drink their blood. Um, it's considered like low quality wine, but, I mean, they will drink it.

[00:42:42] Speaker 28: Loot them. If I'm low on, like don't have all my blood tokens, I would probably drink their blood then.

[00:42:50] Speaker 1: Oh, okay. You can just fill up, yeah.

[00:42:51] Speaker 28: Yeah.

[00:42:52] Speaker 1: They're close enough to your level that-

[00:42:53] Speaker 28: Dispose of the bodies.

[00:42:55] Speaker 1: Oh.

[00:42:55] Speaker 28: And just not leave them in the middle of the camp.

[00:42:58] Speaker 1: (laughs)

[00:42:58] Speaker 28: That's my type of scenario.

[00:43:00] Speaker 1: Did you ever do that? Now you're feeling full. And given your level, yeah you're feeling pretty full up. You're thinking, you know, "Maybe I need to refill for a while." Um, yeah I ordered the blood tokens. I haven't got them yet 'cause they're coming from Europe, so apparently blood tokens are hard to find in the US. Go figure. Uh, or at least the ones I want. So, um, the next day comes, um, your... You know, sun comes up. It isn't too long. It's probably, I'd go with mid-afternoon. Um, in your caravan, right, you hear some noise again and you hear the gate opening and the sounds of horses.

[00:43:38] Speaker 28: Uh, okay. I could... I'm guessing would I know this would be a caravan?

[00:43:45] Speaker 1: Well, as you're... If you look out to take a peek at them, you see, um, humans I suppose mostly, riding horses. Logically, yes you would think it's probably part of a caravan.

[00:43:58] Speaker 28: (laughs)

[00:43:58] Speaker 1: But there could be other... Humans do patrol the road. Um, and this part of the, of the, uh, Theorems Crossing, uh, the Iron, the Jade Kingdoms does have knights and whatnot, as well as some dwarves who will, who do police the road as much as they can. Which isn't much, but...

[00:44:18] Speaker 28: Uh, okay. As... Watch them and if they're coming to camp

[00:44:24] Speaker 31: Um, are you gonna, you gonna try to hide then or...

[00:44:31] Speaker 28: Um, not hide but not like stand in the middle of the road announcing my presence.

[00:44:40] Speaker 31: Oh.

[00:44:40] Speaker 28: How did he do?

[00:44:41] Speaker 1: Um, I mean if you kind of just remain unseen but not hidden. Um, they come into the, into the encampment and they are basically just, they go through a one big circle. They're looking in and everything. (coughs) They would eventually discover you because they are (coughs) trying to make sure the place is empty. But yeah, they notice you. They sh- they... One guy shouts to the other as they come riding up. Well, they're probably just mounted at this point and they come over to see you. Um, um, and run with that, you know, they do kind of have their swords drawn a little bit. Um, they're defensive.

[00:45:14] Speaker 32: If they ask why, just tell them waiting for caravan. Was told caravan could be coming in a few days, so waiting.

[00:45:25] Speaker 1: Um, when would they will sheathe their, their swords once they arrive. Do try to put diplomacy if you want her to see how calming you are to them. Reassure them you're not a threat basically, is all it is.

[00:45:38] Speaker 33: How are the Vampyrs seen in this world?

[00:45:40] Speaker 34: (die rolling)

[00:45:41] Speaker 1: Um, (clears throat) in-

[00:45:43] Speaker 32: Five plus three.

[00:45:44] Speaker 1: Five plus three? Oh. This one you can just, for diplomacy you can just add them together, so eight.

[00:45:49] Speaker 32: Oh. Plus the eight.

[00:45:50] Speaker 1: Um, you're not the most convincing, but, um, they'll eventually, they... Luckily for you, other... This is how other of the Shadow Elves or Grails will join the caravan, so they're not unused... Th- th- it's not unusual to see them here waiting. So, they kind of see it, but, um, it doesn't leave a huge impression on them. Um, for a Vampyr, um, you wouldn't see them as much. There are very few Vampyr... Dwarves are pretty resilient to being bitten. Um, in the Jade Kingdoms there are. Um, also in the Iron Kingdoms there are. Um, a lot of times they tend to be as their own kind of like quasi-nobility. Um, and they do a lot with, uh, um, mercantile stuff. They build, kind of like the vampires, agents outside of the, of Astoria.

[00:46:45] Speaker 33: Mm-hmm.

[00:46:46] Speaker 1: Um, now in their case, most Vampyr don't live in Astoria because they're vampires and, and you know, competing for the same resources. But there is one group that does have some Vamp- Vampyr in Astoria and that is the Gray Elves, because they've been preyed on by the, uh, vampire for a long time. Okay.

[00:47:01] Speaker 33: They're not like the Orcs where we're just like borderline kill on sight or-

[00:47:06] Speaker 1: Oh.

[00:47:07] Speaker 33: ... expect to fight with them?

[00:47:08] Speaker 1: No. Um, Vampyr, um, typically they're almost more of a noble.

[00:47:12] Speaker 33: Okay.

[00:47:12] Speaker 1: And they're... Vampyr can be a different story, but, uh, Vampyr are not, um... See, they're still half alive and generally speaking they fit well into their own societies. They're just kind of the oddballs to a certain degree.

[00:47:25] Speaker 33: Mm-hmm. Cool.

[00:47:27] Speaker 1: So you stay there for a while in the caravan serai. The, uh, you find out that this is the vanguard for the, for the caravan that's coming. Um, basically they scout ahead of the, of the caravan and then they are securing this area. Were there monsters running around and other stuff, they would take care of it. Um, they kind of, I don't want to say ignore you. This is a very surly bunch. Um, all of you guys who've dealt with mercenaries, um, know that mercenaries are not, um, most, um... How do I put this? They're kind of uncouth-

[00:48:01] Speaker 28: (laughs)

[00:48:01] Speaker 1: ... to a certain degree. So yes, while you're there you're hearing a lot of crude talk. And these are mercenaries. This, uh, the Iron Kingdoms itself has kind of gone into this, uh...

[00:48:10] Speaker 28: Those are the same riders or a different group?

[00:48:12] Speaker 1: No, the same ones. They're, they're dressed in kind of almost a, um, renaissance type armor. Um, let me show you some examples here. But, you know, they have the renaissance kind. They are not in like full medieval plate. Um, they're a little bit beyond that period right now. But they're, um... So yes, they have some of the renaissance things like, um, the men have, um... You guys are used to Renaissance type mercenaries.

[00:48:37] Speaker 28: Mm-hmm.

[00:48:37] Speaker 1: They have cod pieces.

[00:48:39] Speaker 28: (coughs)

[00:48:39] Speaker 1: And they're over-exaggerated. Um, there are maybe some ladies with them who do have, um-You know, the, the armor that's like boob armor with exaggerated female parts on it. Um, it's like these are not, um, people you generally want to hang out with unless you like this kind of, um, very crude, like, look of people. So, while you're waiting for the caravan, depending upon how your character feels about it, it might be- you might fit in with them or it might be very uncomfortable having this, this, kind of, people surrounding you. See if I have one.

[00:49:13] Speaker 35: She'd probably just try to stay to herself, wouldn't partake.

[00:49:18] Speaker 1: Oh. Before too long, the rest of you guys arrive, um, your caravan pulls in. Um, the caravan leader would come up, greet you if- when he finds out that you're here to join the, the wagon heading, uh, west. Um, he introduces you to your group and says, "Well, you can join these people here." He makes you the same deal that he offered them. You can help if you help guard the, um, uh...

[00:49:44] Speaker 35: Caravan?

[00:49:45] Speaker 1: Yeah, the, the back part of it, um, he'll, uh, let you, uh, join and probably pay you a little bit when you guys-

[00:49:53] Speaker 35: There?

[00:49:53] Speaker 1: ... get to Teagarden's Crossing.

[00:49:54] Speaker 35: I hope guard your caravan.

[00:49:55] Speaker 1: You can say hello to the rest of the group.

[00:49:58] Speaker 35: Hello.

[00:49:59] Speaker 36: Well met.

[00:50:00] Speaker 7: Hey there.

[00:50:02] Speaker 1: The interesting thing about this is that you'll ask-

[00:50:04] Speaker 35: Okay, so what class, what race are you?

[00:50:05] Speaker 1: I'm a Duragar.

[00:50:06] Speaker 35: What race are you again?

[00:50:07] Speaker 37: Uh, Nord.

[00:50:09] Speaker 35: And you're a lizard. Lizard, dwarf. Okay, got it.

[00:50:14] Speaker 1: The last campaign we had all the really short people. This campaign we have... Well, I mean, it's a very diverse one but we also have two gray-skinned characters which I thought was interesting. Reid, you're lighter gray and you're a little bit darker gray, but I don't say anything to you. I just nod. You can speak Parseltongue and really blow their mind with this one. (laughs) Um, so you guys have a new meet. Um, the rest of the caravan comes in. You guys have had kind of a long hard day on the trail. Um, and just being on alert kind of really sucks. Um, so after a, a while, um, caravan settles in. Um, you're basically at another phase here where they ask you all to help secure... Some of the caravans are setting up their prison for the night, but the head guy comes to you guys and asks, um, if you guys can help secure the, uh, site, uh, for the evening. So once again we'll do skill checks, you guys can each pick something you wanna do. There's a lot of different things you could do here. As I mentioned there's goblin totems that are to help keep the orcs and goblins away. Using religion you could try to, you know, mess with those and enhance them. Um, you can try to use crafting and work on some of the, any of the walls that might have fallen apart or fixing any of the gates. Um, uh, s- uh, survival could be used to set little traps outside the perimeter. Um, nature, if you have an ability to speak to animals maybe through nature you can try to communicate with the animals and get basic thoughts from them on the area. Um, really you can do a lot of different things depending upon what your skills and what not are. So I'll let you think for a second, if you have something let me know.

[00:51:49] Speaker 38: Um, I'd like to use athletics to, like, drive stakes into the ground around the perimeter, just try and form some kind of defensive barrier.

[00:51:57] Speaker 1: Okay, kind of like the, uh, picket, are they pickets or what are they called? The old pikes they used to put out to protect from charges.

[00:52:04] Speaker 38: Yeah, like the wooden stuff that goes that way. I forget what they would do with it.

[00:52:06] Speaker 1: Yeah, you could do that.

[00:52:10] Speaker 7: Uh, 21.

[00:52:11] Speaker 1: Okay, yeah. You get a bunch and you're able to... Now you can't do the entire caravan's right, but you are able to get maybe the entrances where they're coming in and you can definitely get some to make it look, you know, if they're going to try to charge and anything that's right there he's going to try to charge you like those, um, orc, he might have to think twice because it would be a very painful entry for them.

[00:52:28] Speaker 38: Mm-hmm. While I'm doing that, I'm telling a story to, like, some of the other workers helping me. I just end it with, "The ale was flat, the gold was cursed, but damn it I'd do it again."

[00:52:37] Speaker 35: (laughs)

[00:52:38] Speaker 37: I will use religion to make more and... of the goblin totems that were already there in the camp and make more and, like, make them more effective.

[00:52:53] Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, you definitely do that.

[00:52:56] Speaker 35: Uh, wait you... Secret or not?

[00:52:58] Speaker 1: No, this one's going to be secret.

[00:53:01] Speaker 35: 22.

[00:53:01] Speaker 1: 22? Yep, that's good enough. Um, uh, yeah, you're able to do that and improve, even improve some of the stuff that's out there. It looks a little more creepy now as far as the orcs and goblins. You know they're very superstitious. Um, and so it's probably not too hard, you know like the Blair Witch Project with all the creepy stuff in the forest. You know you can do stuff like that that will probably, you know, scare them away a little bit. So you guys have two successes. Watch out.

[00:53:26] Speaker 37: Uh, I like the idea of, of setting up traps using survival so I'll move outside the ring of, um, sharp stakes that he set up, move closer to the edge of the forest. Uh, and start setting up some traps. And, uh, while I'm out there I'll secretly talk to my friend, uh, that nobody else has met yet.

[00:53:47] Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

[00:53:48] Speaker 37: So, uh, but I will roll for the, uh, um, the survival check.

[00:53:53] Speaker 35: Did you say the word familiar?

[00:53:55] Speaker 37: Didn't say anything.

[00:53:56] Speaker 35: Oh, nope.

[00:53:56] Speaker 1: Nope.

[00:53:56] Speaker 37: Didn't say a word. Uh, damn, my rolls are not great today.

[00:54:02] Speaker 1: (laughs)

[00:54:02] Speaker 37: Uh, eight total.

[00:54:04] Speaker 1: Um, up there but not a crit fail. Um, I mean you snap some but you're having a hard time, the wood is too, um, moist still. So you can't... You need it to be just right where it's not going to snap and it's not gonna... You know, whatever vines you're able to find and whatnot is just breaking every time you try to set it so you don't get a, you know, very many sets. But last but not least, uh, Irv, if you...

[00:54:26] Speaker 7: Uh, Kotal would like to, um, also set up snares although he doesn't want to go outside of this, this, the spikes. He's going to try and set up some snares just inside for anyone who makes it past them and design, and they're designed to, like, trip people up, not to maim or hurt them, but-

[00:54:46] Speaker 1: Oh, literally.

[00:54:46] Speaker 7: ... cause them to trip or get tangled to make it easier in case we need to fight them. With survival.

[00:54:52] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[00:54:54] Speaker 39: Uh, crit. Not funny.

[00:54:56] Speaker 1: Okay. Yeah. (laughs)

[00:54:57] Speaker 40: Woo!

[00:54:57] Speaker 1: You used to have some very wicked looking tripwire around the area and it's, it's disguised very well, so... Um, as far as, um, Lin and, uh, Sylvia-

[00:55:10] Speaker 41: (coughs)

[00:55:10] Speaker 1: ... uh, go, they have their own kind of ways about doing it. Um, Lin will eventually, um... He starts spreading incense with his, uh, gets out a, you know, some accouterments that, uh... And you guys have this really nice smelling, (sniffs) burning incense for, um, I suppose Asian incense or whatnot. I really should have put some incense or something on down here but... Um, as he kind of goes through, he says some prayers over the, uh, the area. Um, depending on how religious you are, you don't know if that's effective or not, but he kind of does that. Sylvia, um, also goes through. She spends some of her time, um, she goes with a few of the other workers and, and she kind of oversees them with some of her crafting skills and whatnot, and repairing any of the walls that looked like they were not quite so good but... Um, so time passes. Um, you guys are, um, kind of set up to a watch overnight, so I don't know if you guys have an order you wanna be in or whatnot.

[00:56:16] Speaker 42: I can take first watch.

[00:56:18] Speaker 1: First.

[00:56:19] Speaker 43: I'll go second.

[00:56:19] Speaker 42: Second.

[00:56:20] Speaker 40: How much lighting is in this caravan?

[00:56:22] Speaker 1: I mean, this is a fairly well lit.

[00:56:24] Speaker 40: Mm-hmm.

[00:56:24] Speaker 1: One thing you could have also chosen too is gather sticks instead of torches. But there are some, there is light, um, throughout the night. They're not, um... I mean, though most of these mercenaries and people n- they've done this route a lot. They know how dangerous and they do take... They're prepared with lights and stuff, so...

[00:56:39] Speaker 40: I'll take middle watch.

[00:56:41] Speaker 1: Middle? And that kind of puts you last. Um, so... Okay. Well, the night starts off, um, interestingly enough. Um, you guys are kind of settling in. Your character is, all of a sudden he starts hearing some ruckus coming up. Uh, coming from the back entrance, the area that kind of assigned you to come in.

[00:57:01] Speaker 42: Mm-hmm.

[00:57:02] Speaker 1: Um, you hear some weird little high squeaks. Um, uh, you hear a few trips or something, you know, a few things falling on the ground. Some cursing in this weird language. What languages?

[00:57:15] Speaker 42: Can I do like a recall knowledge to try and identify other languages?

[00:57:18] Speaker 1: Oh, yeah. What languages does everyone speak in it? I don't remember.

[00:57:21] Speaker 39: You told us not to say that out loud.

[00:57:23] Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, that's right. Um-

[00:57:23] Speaker 42: Trick question. (laughs)

[00:57:25] Speaker 1: (laughs) It's a good thing you remembered that. Um, just a second here, because I gotta remember... I can't remember off the top of my head.

[00:57:33] Speaker 39: Probably not the ones they're speaking, is my-

[00:57:35] Speaker 42: Yeah, I can almost guarantee they don't speak languages I know.

[00:57:38] Speaker 39: Common, except it's called something else.

[00:57:41] Speaker 1: I'd say if anyone speaks, I won't... Well-

[00:57:44] Speaker 40: What is this, Goblinish you say?

[00:57:46] Speaker 1: You would recognize it as Goblinish.

[00:57:48] Speaker 40: And...

[00:57:50] Speaker 42: I would probably recognize it then.

[00:57:51] Speaker 1: It's the same speaking that you heard when they were exploring.

[00:57:53] Speaker 40: Mm-hmm.

[00:57:53] Speaker 1: So that's a way, how you're able to put two and two together.

[00:57:55] Speaker 42: Since I fought to see goblins in like my youth, I could probably recognize Goblinish.

[00:57:59] Speaker 1: Yeah, you probably would understand them.

[00:58:00] Speaker 42: Yeah.

[00:58:00] Speaker 39: At the very least.

[00:58:01] Speaker 42: I don't know if I'd understand it, but at least hear it and know it.

[00:58:04] Speaker 39: I know what German sounds like, even though I don't speak or understand German.

[00:58:07] Speaker 1: So at least the very two of you-

[00:58:08] Speaker 39: It's the main language. Like, you recognize the language.

[00:58:11] Speaker 1: I know your character probably-

[00:58:12] Speaker 39: I definitely don't speak it, yeah.

[00:58:13] Speaker 1: By the way, goblins are very much... Especially all throughout this area here, goblins are a real threat. There's some of them in Solstheim and same thing in the areas over there. And d- definitely where they're from. But when you get more to like Hyboria, Aegyptus and Romanis, um, that's more kobolds, are kind of the same thing, the, the bottom feeders that, um...

[00:58:34] Speaker 41: They fill that ecological niche. (laughs)

[00:58:36] Speaker 1: Yeah. In the area you're from, they're not so much over there but there's what's known as skinks. They're small little lizard type creatures, um, that are also a huge, um, nuisance to you, t- in the areas you're from but... So yeah, you, you hear little goblins. You're not sure if they're cursing, um, a few of them you can hear them falling, and then some yelping.

[00:58:59] Speaker 42: Um, I will throw a javelin in their general direction just in terms of intimidating and be like, "Get out of here, you crazies. This ain't no camp for you."

[00:59:09] Speaker 1: Yep, go ahead and... I'll let you, um-

[00:59:12] Speaker 42: Yeah.

[00:59:12] Speaker 1: Yeah, just make a roll just for the hell of it, see how-

[00:59:13] Speaker 42: Yeah, I'm not totally sure if I'm adding intimidation or what.

[00:59:16] Speaker 1: You can do it if you want to, since it's part of that you can roll intimidation if you want.

[00:59:19] Speaker 42: Um, that's a 13.

[00:59:21] Speaker 1: 13. Um, they definitely hear you. You hear a thud, then you hear some yelping and then all of a sudden you hear this, "Oi, what's going on? Wha-" Uh-

[00:59:33] Speaker 42: Is that from back in my camp or-

[00:59:35] Speaker 1: No, it's coming from out there and it's, um-

[00:59:37] Speaker 40: Uh-oh.

[00:59:37] Speaker 1: ... yelping. This appears to be in, um, Common. "What do you thinks you're doing and sending that stuff our ways?"

[00:59:45] Speaker 39: "Well, what you're doing by our camp? We're trying to sleep out here."

[00:59:49] Speaker 1: "Well, no, that's why I was here. You guys, uh, I heard some... Sent me little guys out to explore this area and they come back missing." And it sounds like it's approaching you as-
---

[00:59:59] Speaker 1: ... he's talking. Um, eventually he, you do see a large creature come up to the gate.

[01:00:04] Speaker 2: I whistle to try and get other people's attention.

[01:00:06] Speaker 1: Oh. Yeah, you guys would hear, you can join him out there.

[01:00:10] Speaker 2: Okay.

[01:00:10] Speaker 1: Um, he comes to the gate. He knocks and says, "Oh, what's this?" You, you realize there's a great big, uh, orc. Orc? (footsteps thudding) I choose, uh, you. And I'll get out some stuff here in a moment. You guys, I don't really have any Snotlings but-

[01:00:36] Speaker 3: (laughs)

[01:00:36] Speaker 1: ... just using regular goblins for now. (footsteps thudding) And we got an actual map too(footsteps thudding) and some other cool stuff. We're going to fight maybe, probably. Um, you know what? I'm gonna use this one. I'm gonna use this one. Down by the river.

[01:01:04] Speaker 4: That's at the big rescue, like river. But yeah, I saw the river there so... Okay. (footsteps thudding)

[01:01:21] Speaker 1: Yeah, I still haven't figured out my thing for creating a rescue... Oh, what do you know? (upbeat music) Oh, stop. Done. Fine, thank you. Okay, it's been an hour. Um, no one has spent a, uh, uh-

[01:01:41] Speaker 2: Here's my-

[01:01:41] Speaker 1: What you wanna call it, so go ahead and roll.

[01:01:46] Speaker 5: Oh. 10.

[01:01:48] Speaker 4: Five.

[01:01:48] Speaker 6: 20.

[01:01:49] Speaker 1: Oh, deal.

[01:01:50] Speaker 6: The first, first good roll is this one.

[01:01:53] Speaker 1: (laughs)

[01:01:53] Speaker 3: Well, now you have an extra zero point for when you roll bad again.

[01:01:55] Speaker 4: Did you even try your... Are you even trying your eyeball dice?

[01:01:58] Speaker 6: I don't know, I was trying to use di- a different one since this is a new campaign but maybe I need to go back to the eyeball dice.

[01:02:10] Speaker 1: There's some... Uh.

[01:02:14] Speaker 4: Okay, where do you feel them?

[01:02:16] Speaker 1: These are just basically the walls. They're not... They're actually much taller, they're not piles of... So basically the, you know, kind of this area is here. And then you have the caravans are in here. Your guys' gate is right there, and there's another gate on the other side. Um, there's a little fire burning in the middle. I could set that out but I don't know if it's... So, you guys are kind of in this area.

[01:02:36] Speaker 6: Oh, fuck.

[01:02:37] Speaker 3: (coughs)

[01:02:39] Speaker 1: Yeah, why not, let's put out some stuff, make it look like... Ooh. Yeah, that's nice. There's some tents going up.

[01:02:52] Speaker 3: (coughs)

[01:03:07] Speaker 1: That's nice. Yeah, you guys have some... (chair creaking) There's some trees. Well, they're not probably quite so close but they've been felled away a little bit. Okay.

[01:03:28] Speaker 5: Battery fell out.

[01:03:30] Speaker 1: What's that?

[01:03:30] Speaker 5: The battery fell out.

[01:03:32] Speaker 1: Yeah. Oh yeah, it was, it was... I have to put it in each time we use it. There we go.

[01:03:41] Speaker 4: Is your mini the one with the staff?

[01:03:43] Speaker 1: Hmm?

[01:03:44] Speaker 4: Is your mini the one with the staff?

[01:03:47] Speaker 1: This guy here, that's Lynn. I don't think-

[01:03:49] Speaker 4: Oh.

[01:03:49] Speaker 1: ... I ever introduced him to you, so. Sylvia and Lynn kind of get with you guys too, you guys are kind of right up there.

[01:03:55] Speaker 6: Where'd mine go? Oh, there it is. Okay, you just had to put it out, yeah.

[01:03:58] Speaker 1: You can put yourself wherever you'd like to be. There's an orc on the other side of the gate.

[01:04:05] Speaker 3: (coughs)

[01:04:06] Speaker 1: And there's some little goblins around them. These are very young ones, very s- somewhat similar to the one you saw. And he says, "I'm, I'm just here to, to talk. I had some little kids out there s- exploring this place and they've gone missing. Don't suppose you fine folk would know what's going on here?"

[01:04:28] Speaker 2: We haven't seen 'em.

[01:04:30] Speaker 3: Would I have known, uh, the, the ones he's looking for would be the three I killed?

[01:04:35] Speaker 1: Um, it's, uh, you would, uh, surmise that.

[01:04:38] Speaker 3: Mm-hmm. Okay. I'm just, hmm, yeah.

[01:04:41] Speaker 2: No reason to confess that.

[01:04:43] Speaker 3: Nope, not gonna say anything and try to like, make it seem-

[01:04:48] Speaker 1: (laughs)

[01:04:48] Speaker 3: Maybe make him not notice me right away.

[01:04:50] Speaker 1: Whistle and look off in the distance.

[01:04:52] Speaker 2: We don't know anything about that. Be on your way now.

[01:04:55] Speaker 3: (clears throat)

[01:04:58] Speaker 1: Now, uh, it would not be right for me if I didn't go in there and see what's gone on. Um, (clears throat) and after all this caravan's gone through our territory and you haven't, uh, paid the toll.

[01:05:12] Speaker 6: It's a free road, no toll, not for you.

[01:05:15] Speaker 3: (laughs)

[01:05:17] Speaker 1: He says, "Well, I'm a, um-"

[01:05:20] Speaker 6: You all notice that it hit my, uh, tattoos are starting to glow faintly.

[01:05:25] Speaker 3: You are not welcome here. Leave now.

[01:05:30] Speaker 4: Like your chest is full of tattoos and you're-

[01:05:32] Speaker 1: He seems a little taken back when he looks at your guy. He says, "What? He's even greener than us."

[01:05:36] Speaker 4: Got it.

[01:05:36] Speaker 1: "How'd you get him? And what..." And he kind of looks at you and he has dark vision but he's look, he's staring at you like, "How'd you guys get someone greener? You're the most strange kind of orc I ever saw."

[01:05:46] Speaker 3: "It's not about the color of your skin but the content of your character."

[01:05:50] Speaker 1: "What? And you-"

[01:05:53] Speaker 4: "I tend to stay in the shadow."

[01:05:54] Speaker 1: "The only toll you'll get is from old Bessie here." And I slam the maul against my hand.

[01:05:59] Speaker 3: Ow.

[01:06:01] Speaker 1: Oh, he says, "Well, I was gonna be nice, and I was, uh..." Granted, I cannot do a Cockney accent.

[01:06:07] Speaker 7: (laughs)

[01:06:08] Speaker 1: If you guys ever listened to Warhammer, anything tied to Warhammer.

[01:06:11] Speaker 8: Mm-hmm.

[01:06:11] Speaker 1: Orcs always have a British, Cockney accent.

[01:06:14] Speaker 7: Ugh.

[01:06:14] Speaker 9: Yeah.

[01:06:15] Speaker 1: But I can't do a British, Cockney accent. So that, if you can imagine it, that's what I'm gunning for. He says, "Well, was gonna try doing this the nice way, but, uh, well I suppose-"

[01:06:24] Speaker 7: (laughs)

[01:06:25] Speaker 1: "... we're just gonna have to, uh, come in and extract our toll, um, as it is." And you can roll initiative.

[01:06:32] Speaker 8: Woo.

[01:06:32] Speaker 1: So does someone wanna track or...

[01:06:34] Speaker 10: Yeah, I can do that.

[01:06:36] Speaker 9: Would they have not noticed me?

[01:06:38] Speaker 1: You can roll yours, your initiative using stealth if you want, since you were trying to hide.

[01:06:45] Speaker 10: Mm-hmm.

[01:06:45] Speaker 7: And you just add your stealth bonus instead of your-

[01:06:48] Speaker 1: Yeah, basically instead of initiative, you roll.

[01:06:49] Speaker 8: I'll roll a stealth check instead of a perception check. Ancestors. And when I roll initiative, I go into a rage. (dices clattering) Oh, yeah.

[01:07:02] Speaker 7: Hm.

[01:07:04] Speaker 11: She has actions.

[01:07:07] Speaker 1: Okay, Matthew's character, whose name I may or may not know.

[01:07:10] Speaker 11: Uh, my character's name is, uh, Arnor.

[01:07:15] Speaker 1: Arnor?

[01:07:16] Speaker 11: A-R-N-O-R.

[01:07:17] Speaker 1: Okay. You guys haven't really introduced yourself, although the three of you probably have learned each other's name, I'm guessing, off the here and then.

[01:07:22] Speaker 10: I think it's initiative by player name, too.

[01:07:24] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[01:07:24] Speaker 10: So I'm just gonna use that.

[01:07:25] Speaker 1: Plus, we are gonna get to another event we call a campfire, which we just haven't done yet, but...

[01:07:30] Speaker 10: Uh, so what's your initiative been?

[01:07:31] Speaker 11: Uh, 14.

[01:07:33] Speaker 8: I thought you didn't wanna s- stay and stuff around campfires.

[01:07:37] Speaker 1: Oh, no, when we get to the campfire, um, we're kinda cover this stuff too.

[01:07:40] Speaker 11: The difference between, uh, in-character and out-of-character stuff.

[01:07:43] Speaker 1: (laughs)

[01:07:43] Speaker 9: True.

[01:07:43] Speaker 8: 'Cause in-character, your character can say whatever your character would say.

[01:07:47] Speaker 11: Yeah. Your character does not have a character sheet with their abilities on it.

[01:07:50] Speaker 9: That's true, yeah.

[01:07:50] Speaker 11: So you're not gonna be like, "I have a plus three to blah, blah, blah."

[01:07:53] Speaker 9: Yes, that's very-

[01:07:53] Speaker 10: "You guys might not know this, but as a dwarf, I have darkvision."

[01:07:56] Speaker 9: (laughs) That's true.

[01:07:58] Speaker 10: Uh, Katie, what's your initiative?

[01:08:00] Speaker 7: 12.

[01:08:01] Speaker 8: I have some familiarity with your people. I am-

[01:08:04] Speaker 10: Irv, what's your initiative?

[01:08:04] Speaker 8: ... inclined that I rolled a 15-

[01:08:07] Speaker 10: (laughs) Okay.

[01:08:08] Speaker 8: ... on my imaginary dice that Gaia has blessed me with.

[01:08:12] Speaker 10: What are the names of the baby goblins again? Snablings? Snabblings?

[01:08:17] Speaker 9: S- snabblings weren't Gits.

[01:08:18] Speaker 10: Snabblings, not Gits.

[01:08:18] Speaker 9: weren't Gits.

[01:08:18] Speaker 1: Sometimes they're called Gits, um, little Gits. Um... (dice clattering) What's Bay Spen is starting this shift, um, is he's gonna take his great big maul. He's gonna slam it up against the gate. And little chains are holding the gate together, just snap and the gate starts to swing open.

[01:08:46] Speaker 9: Is this a-

[01:08:47] Speaker 1: And that's launching the initiative.

[01:08:47] Speaker 9: ... metal gate? Wood gate?

[01:08:49] Speaker 1: Mostly wooden. And this is ver- kind of, you know, it's been built, it's recent, but it's also not super high-quality yet. So yeah, basically it's goblin's one through five, and then an orc.

[01:09:11] Speaker 10: Are the snablings each on their own initiative then?

[01:09:13] Speaker 1: Yeah, a lot of times I just let 'em do things on their own initiative. Or I might do them in pairs sometimes. We'll do these how about, we'll do 'em in pairs.

[01:09:21] Speaker 8: They don't number the bases. You have, we're not here for the introduction of the numbered basis.

[01:09:25] Speaker 10: Mm-hmm.

[01:09:26] Speaker 8: They're colored and numbered.

[01:09:28] Speaker 1: So Green doesn't, so I'm gonna have to make another batch, just in case.

[01:09:31] Speaker 10: I think they're only used in, uh, like-

[01:09:32] Speaker 1: One shot.

[01:09:33] Speaker 10: ... one through five.

[01:09:34] Speaker 1: Yeah, we did, um, use them in there a little bit. Got these from, uh, Pathfinder League. A guy passed on the files for this and it's kinda the coolest thing I... Was really happy he did. Oh, can we ask, well, if they need initiatives too?

[01:09:55] Speaker 10: So, you said in pairs, or they can go-

[01:09:57] Speaker 1: Yeah, we can do 'em in pairs.

[01:09:58] Speaker 10: Okay.

[01:09:58] Speaker 1: Um, so there'll be six of 'em all together.

[01:10:01] Speaker 10: Yep.

[01:10:04] Speaker 1: So, basically one and two are gonna be on one initiative, they're gonna be...

[01:10:08] Speaker 9: (yawns) Okay.

[01:10:12] Speaker 1: Oh, yeah. No, it's gonna be two NPCs. Well, we won't have the NPCs, they're gonna be fighting but they're not gonna be a part of the initiative, it's just not something to slow anything down. All right.

[01:10:25] Speaker 10: That sounds good.

[01:10:26] Speaker 1: Uh. Okay. Here somewhere. They put the initiatives in a really weird spot, so it's nuts.

[01:10:39] Speaker 8: (hiccups) Excuse me.

[01:10:41] Speaker 1: There we go, perception plus two.

[01:10:42] Speaker 8: (sighs).

[01:10:43] Speaker 1: Oh, so we have a 13 for a group one.

[01:10:45] Speaker 10: For a one, two?

[01:10:46] Speaker 1: One, two. Uh, three, four, is gonna be a 20, five, six is gonna be an 11, Orc Biggun... Orc Biggun's there. Uh, he (dice clattering) is a 10. We need a little more to work. Uh, here, I'm actually gonna get some water. Somebody said he wants some too, and I can do some.

[01:11:14] Speaker 7: (coughs).

[01:11:15] Speaker 1: I also do this at the moment here. Yeah.

[01:11:18] Speaker 10: So even though Gits, 34, go first.

[01:11:21] Speaker 1: Where did I... Oh, there he is. Yeah. There are no ties. Woo! Okay. Just put those there. (box slamming) Okay. Be right back. Anyone else want water or is there still any other stuff?

[01:11:42] Speaker 11: I'm good. I'm okay right now.

[01:11:44] Speaker 1: Right now? Irv, you something good? Well, usually good.

[01:11:46] Speaker 10: Good. Funny. (laughs) Let me get some.

[01:11:51] Speaker 1: And since Kent's not here, I'm gonna have to remember that yours is the one without water. Without ice.

[01:11:58] Speaker 7: Mm-hmm.

[01:12:31] Speaker 12: If any of you guys got storm damage from the, like, hail damage or anything through the storm?

[01:12:37] Speaker 13: No. I did have a cracked windshield that happened the same day, but before the storm happened.

[01:12:43] Speaker 12: (coughs)

[01:12:45] Speaker 13: Just drove my car to work and I was like, "What the hell is that?" That was fun. What about you, any damage?

[01:12:52] Speaker 12: No, but I heard it hailing at work and it hailed here, yeah, here in town, so...

[01:13:01] Speaker 13: Emily works from home, so she heard it and heard... Was surprised and so have I. Yeah, to be surprised.

[01:13:06] Speaker 12: Some of my, some of my family who live over, like, between Saint Paul and Madison. Um, apparently they had damage.

[01:13:15] Speaker 13: Hmm.

[01:13:16] Speaker 12: Like, if not siding damage, uh-

[01:13:19] Speaker 1: Okay, well. You know what's, I don't know if this is-

[01:13:22] Speaker 12: Like dents in car, like some extra, some new dents.

[01:13:25] Speaker 1: Yikes. I was seeing that 'cause my, well, my parents, when they first moved to Wisconsin from Montana, they had a big, um, hailstorm up north and it was so bad that they wound up getting, you know, new roofing, 'cause their insurance covered it. So I was watching that 'cause my house is probably about, uh, five or six years out from needing to get a new roof. And I was watching this going, "Do you know if this would just pick up a little bit, then maybe I can find hail damage."

[01:13:49] Speaker 12: This place?

[01:13:49] Speaker 1: Yeah. I'm getting clo-... Like I said, in five, five or six years, I'm gonna have to. But it sucks because I have to get another half and most places only do the entire roof, they won't do half of it. And I don't know how she's doing with being able to afford...

[01:14:04] Speaker 12: I was about to say, are you gonna go in good standing with your neighbor?

[01:14:07] Speaker 1: I mean, yeah, we get along and everything, but you don't have to... I don't know how... You know, I'm setting aside money now, I don't know how she's doing. Typically, we don't have to do much shared stuff. Probably that stupid tree we had to get cut down and whatnot, me and Mia started worrying about sharing stuff. So, first off-

[01:14:27] Speaker 13: Goblins three, four.

[01:14:29] Speaker 1: Okay.

[01:14:30] Speaker 13: Or he hits three, four. Come on deck.

[01:14:34] Speaker 1: Okay. Then we'll move forward and try to attack you guys, if you (...)

[01:14:44] Speaker 14: Okay. Hmm. Not too bad.

[01:14:52] Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I need to refill that, that candy cauldron here one of these days. So do you guys have any favorites? Um...

[01:14:58] Speaker 12: Sour Patch Kids.

[01:14:59] Speaker 15: (laughs)

[01:15:02] Speaker 1: Sour stuff? Okay. Let's see, one, two, three, four-

[01:15:06] Speaker 12: That and chocolate are, like, my go-to.

[01:15:12] Speaker 1: Okay. Uh, three and four there. Good guys in back, so one, two, three, four, five, so...

[01:15:23] Speaker 13: I think that's two.

[01:15:24] Speaker 1: Oh, two? Oh, yeah, that is two. Four is there and when is three?

[01:15:29] Speaker 12: Three is back, yep.

[01:15:29] Speaker 1: Three's over there. Oh. Uh, so one, oh, one, two, three. He's gonna move up to Irv and make an attack and then four-

[01:15:39] Speaker 13: Right.

[01:15:39] Speaker 1: ... is just gonna move up and run under the big by's, big guy's legs and he'll move up to you. Um, then he'll make an attack on you guys.

[01:15:46] Speaker 12: Um. Okay.

[01:15:48] Speaker 1: They have their crude little goblin weapons. They have little dog slicers. One, two, three, four, five, six. Well, so, actually I didn't realize who it was against, so even/odd. Even. So, Irv, they're attacking you. He has a 25 to hit.

[01:16:13] Speaker 13: That's hit.

[01:16:13] Speaker 1: And for six points, ouch. Um, he'll take another attack on you since he has one and he'll miss horribly. On you, two attacks.

[01:16:26] Speaker 13: AC18.

[01:16:27] Speaker 1: First one's, um, 24.

[01:16:30] Speaker 13: It's-

[01:16:30] Speaker 1: Or five points of damage. And second one is not that nearly that much. Okay, next up.

[01:16:40] Speaker 13: Hey, uh, next is me. Irv is on deck.

[01:16:42] Speaker 1: Okay.

[01:16:43] Speaker 15: (laughs)

[01:16:43] Speaker 1: And luckily now because of the new rules, you start raging instead of having to waste an action, which is nice.

[01:16:49] Speaker 13: Well, I was already even before that, like, just on initiative.

[01:16:52] Speaker 1: Yeah, they, they got that now and the old one, in the older rules, you had to wait 'til your first turn and spend your first action to rage.

[01:16:56] Speaker 13: Uh-huh. Yeah.

[01:16:57] Speaker 1: Which sucked.

[01:16:58] Speaker 13: Yeah, if I was wearing heavy armor, I'd still have to do that, but...

[01:17:00] Speaker 1: Oh.

[01:17:02] Speaker 13: Um, okay, I will whack at number, um-

[01:17:06] Speaker 1: Four was the one in front of you. Um, if you move or unless you have reach, you could hit number three.

[01:17:12] Speaker 13: Yeah. That guy was mean to me.

[01:17:16] Speaker 1: Or you can put yourself in to make a flank and take on the big guy.

[01:17:19] Speaker 13: Yeah. Oh, yeah, I thought it would be flanks. I don't wanna do that, that-

[01:17:26] Speaker 1: Well, depending on where you go, they could line up flanks and put it that way.

[01:17:29] Speaker 13: Mm-hmm. Um, yeah, I think I'll just whack on number four then. Right in front of me, that was four. Yep. Okay. That is a 22 to hit.

[01:17:39] Speaker 1: That'll hit. Let me just-

[01:17:40] Speaker 13: Yeah, it's not a crit, but not too far off. Ooh, that's really high. Um, 15 bludgeoning and 30 spirit. (laughs)

[01:17:48] Speaker 1: Okay, well, what happens to him? He gets splattered pretty bad.

[01:17:51] Speaker 13: Here bada, bada, bada. (laughs)

[01:17:54] Speaker 1: (laughs) So you, you pop him over and land him on one of the spikes that you set up basically?

[01:17:58] Speaker 13: Mm-hmm.

[01:17:59] Speaker 1: Okay, four gets splattered.

[01:18:02] Speaker 13: That's one action.

[01:18:03] Speaker 1: I have, yep. Mm-hmm. Other action.

[01:18:11] Speaker 13: I guess I'll just move here, try and make a defensive line.

[01:18:19] Speaker 16: Here. That was a... 11 hit.

[01:18:37] Speaker 17: That will not hit.

[01:18:37] Speaker 16: Yeah, and that is my turn. (dice clattering) Uh, next up is Irv. And Matthew's on deck.

[01:18:47] Speaker 18: Oh.

[01:18:50] Speaker 17: Um, I'm trying to retract just a little bit. Yeah.

[01:18:55] Speaker 19: There's one in front of you. Does it need new batteries?

[01:19:04] Speaker 17: Yeah, or something. I'll have to, um, find out. I can hear it enough. Um... Um... (coughing)

[01:19:10] Speaker 16: Stuck me into flanking.

[01:19:10] Speaker 17: Uh, you can... Well-

[01:19:10] Speaker 18: Oh, is there a wall there?

[01:19:10] Speaker 17: I didn't see... He's, he's-

[01:19:10] Speaker 16: Yeah, it's kind of a-

[01:19:10] Speaker 17: I don't know.

[01:19:10] Speaker 18: I think it'd be more. I didn't know which squares it was in.

[01:19:11] Speaker 17: Yeah. Would you have stepped differently if you knew that, to, uh, point out, because you could have.

[01:19:28] Speaker 18: Uh.

[01:19:28] Speaker 17: Maybe.

[01:19:31] Speaker 18: Not.

[01:19:31] Speaker 17: No, I don't think I would've, 'cause I don't wanna get flanked by these guys.

[01:19:51] Speaker 18: Oh.

[01:19:54] Speaker 17: Besides the one guy I'm already flanked, but hoping he'll go down fast.

[01:19:59] Speaker 16: And he's down.

[01:20:00] Speaker 17: Good.

[01:20:02] Speaker 16: Squares. There we go. Okay. Where was I again? Plus two?

[01:20:10] Speaker 17: Yep. Well, it reduces their AC base.

[01:20:13] Speaker 16: Minus to AC.

[01:20:14] Speaker 17: Oh, minus to, to them.

[01:20:18] Speaker 16: I want to, uh, actually go through him. With Tumble through.

[01:20:28] Speaker 17: The goblin?

[01:20:28] Speaker 16: Yeah, and get on the other side.

[01:20:30] Speaker 17: So you can do a, uh, acrobatics.

[01:20:33] Speaker 16: It's, uh, 19.

[01:20:35] Speaker 17: What's that?

[01:20:36] Speaker 16: 19.

[01:20:37] Speaker 17: 19 versus... I think that's reflex DC?

[01:20:39] Speaker 16: I don't know. I should learn that. It's gonna happen a lot.

[01:20:42] Speaker 17: That works. You do reflect off-

[01:20:44] Speaker 16: So, like, I want to go, get in between, actually, no, between the two little dudes.

[01:20:50] Speaker 17: This way? Yeah, you can... Yeah.

[01:20:52] Speaker 16: It's not technically flanked for them because-

[01:20:56] Speaker 18: That's fine.

[01:20:56] Speaker 16: He'd have to move. The other one would have to move.

[01:20:57] Speaker 17: Yeah. He'd have to move.

[01:20:58] Speaker 16: But he's not... Hopefully not going to be alive.

[01:21:00] Speaker 17: Technically, yeah, they're, they're like, it's, uh, chess night move. They are. Uh, chess night move (laughs) onto each other. I'm going to, um, do two attacks with one action.

[01:21:13] Speaker 18: Just remember they have the sec- the map attacks. Uh, it does still affect them.

[01:21:17] Speaker 16: I know. I'm not using ability names because I don't want to give away my class.

[01:21:23] Speaker 17: No, we have no idea and you didn't even talk about it before this campaign, so I'm thrilled with the idea.

[01:21:28] Speaker 19: (Laughs) You had multiple character ideas that-

[01:21:31] Speaker 16: You... Can you decide how the second one is targeted after you find out what the first one af- happens, or do you have to pick before?

[01:21:38] Speaker 18: I under... I'll... Do you read, read it under the old one?

[01:21:42] Speaker 16: It doesn't say. It just says, "Make two attacks."

[01:21:44] Speaker 19: Thank you.

[01:21:45] Speaker 16: But I don't know if I can know that the first attack kills the first one.

[01:21:49] Speaker 19: Oh.

[01:21:49] Speaker 16: Because these are whippy.

[01:21:50] Speaker 18: Yeah, we can only do... I think under the prior one, the attacks this... The ability had to be used on one enemy. Um, this one is-

[01:21:58] Speaker 16: This specifically says, "If they both hit the same creature," which implies they might not hit the same creature.

[01:22:03] Speaker 19: I think yours are weird.

[01:22:03] Speaker 18: Um, thank you.

[01:22:04] Speaker 16: It just says, "Make two creatures"-

[01:22:05] Speaker 18: Yeah, I'd say we'll just spend one at a time.

[01:22:07] Speaker 16: Okay.

[01:22:08] Speaker 18: Um, well, I'm going to roll them at the same time because if they both hit, they get added together and I don't want to have to memorize the first damage. Um, so I have two different colored dice. That's why it gets mixed up. So it, it's going to be both on the guy out there, unless the first one, it killed him and then the second one will go on the boss because I have leech. Oh, okay.

[01:22:31] Speaker 16: And yellow is first, purple is second. So first is... Scrolled away from my attack bonus. 19?

[01:22:43] Speaker 17: 19 will hit.

[01:22:45] Speaker 16: Hang on, there's a one. Doesn't matter.

[01:22:47] Speaker 19: Nice.

[01:22:47] Speaker 16: Um, so the first one is the only one that hits and that was, uh, on the little guy. Um, 11.

[01:22:57] Speaker 17: 11 damage?

[01:22:58] Speaker 16: Bludgeoning.

[01:22:59] Speaker 17: Okay. Yep, you flung him. You threw him good on the-

[01:23:02] Speaker 19: You hear the staff.

[01:23:03] Speaker 17: Yeah. Flung him pretty good on the head.

[01:23:07] Speaker 16: And my third action is to position my staff defensively.

[01:23:12] Speaker 17: Okay. And next is Matthew. Uh, hits one and two are on deck.

[01:23:19] Speaker 18: Okay.

[01:23:19] Speaker 19: All right. Must be at the bottom.

[01:23:21] Speaker 17: Uh, I'm going to cast, uh, nudge fate.

[01:23:23] Speaker 18: You're after the hits, one and two.

[01:23:25] Speaker 17: I'm going to cast nudge fate on you.

[01:23:27] Speaker 18: Oh, okay.

[01:23:28] Speaker 19: Nudge fate.

[01:23:29] Speaker 17: "When the target fails an attack roll, skill check or saving throw and a plus one bonus would turn a crit fail into a fail or a failure into a success, you grant the target a plus one bonus to the check retroactively. Lasts for a minute."

[01:23:43] Speaker 16: Cool. So it's basically fail by one, get plus one?

[01:23:47] Speaker 17: Yep. Uh, fail or crit fail. Crit fail to a fail or fail to a success, but it won't turn a success into a crit success.

[01:23:56] Speaker 18: Lame.

[01:23:57] Speaker 17: Yeah.

[01:23:58] Speaker 18: Yeah.

[01:23:58] Speaker 17: It is lame. I just realized I should have added plus one to attacks against goblins due to my mountain stronghold stone, but-

[01:24:05] Speaker 18: (laughs)

[01:24:05] Speaker 17: ... yeah, well, next time. Um, so I got maybe do... Is that a circumstance bonus?

[01:24:10] Speaker 20: I don't know if there's an actual, like, condition for it, but yeah, that's what it would... I think it would count as.

[01:24:15] Speaker 18: Just 'cause I already have a plus one circumstance bonus-

[01:24:17] Speaker 17: You can, yeah. Take it 'cause it might be

[01:24:19] Speaker 21: So I don't put status?

[01:24:20] Speaker 19: Just add two.

[01:24:21] Speaker 20: Status bonus.

[01:24:22] Speaker 17: Oh, it's a status bonus.

[01:24:23] Speaker 20: Oh, then yeah, I think we're good. It's a status bonus, not a circumstance bonus.

[01:24:26] Speaker 22: Yay.

[01:24:26] Speaker 23: (laughs)

[01:24:27] Speaker 22: Um, and then, uh, I am going to cast... needle darts.

[01:24:35] Speaker 18: Was that a one action for the one on him, or was it-

[01:24:37] Speaker 22: Yep.

[01:24:37] Speaker 18: Oh, wow. That's pretty good.

[01:24:38] Speaker 22: Yeah.

[01:24:38] Speaker 18: Well, it's always a little counter like... It's a good little one-action counter.

[01:24:42] Speaker 22: Yeah. Ba- basically, we should always go into or-

[01:24:46] Speaker 18: (laughs)

[01:24:46] Speaker 22: ... shortly after a ka- a combat starts, I should use that on somebody.

[01:24:50] Speaker 18: Oh, yeah.

[01:24:52] Speaker 22: Um, since he seems like our front-liner right now and went with him.

[01:24:55] Speaker 18: Grr. (laughs)

[01:24:56] Speaker 22: Um, (smacks lips) all right. So, I'm going to make a spell attack roll against the guy in charge. To work.

[01:25:05] Speaker 18: You can definitely see him standing over the, um-

[01:25:07] Speaker 22: (coughs).

[01:25:07] Speaker 18: I gave him cover 'cause those... 'cause those little snotlings are pretty small.

[01:25:10] Speaker 22: All right. (smacks lips)

[01:25:13] Speaker 18: And...

[01:25:14] Speaker 22: I was wrong. Again, it's plus one to damage, not to

[01:25:16] Speaker 24: Which one are you?

[01:25:16] Speaker 22: It's plus one to damage. Still, that's-

[01:25:18] Speaker 24: That's the bird one?

[01:25:19] Speaker 22: Uh, the guy right there.

[01:25:21] Speaker 18: Who did he work out.

[01:25:21] Speaker 24: He's right there. Yeah.

[01:25:21] Speaker 18: The bir- there's not a bird in your hand.

[01:25:23] Speaker 22: (clicks tongue) Maybe.

[01:25:24] Speaker 18: I don't know.

[01:25:25] Speaker 22: It was just a miniature I chose.

[01:25:26] Speaker 18: (laughs)

[01:25:26] Speaker 24: Okay.

[01:25:27] Speaker 25: What square, uh, what-

[01:25:27] Speaker 22: I'm also not carrying an ax.

[01:25:29] Speaker 18: Yeah.

[01:25:30] Speaker 22: I don't have an ax.

[01:25:31] Speaker 18: I found a cool guy that...

[01:25:33] Speaker 24: Right square.

[01:25:34] Speaker 18: Yeah. Kinda matched the Norn guy, but, uh... Oh, I didn't add tattoos to him. Ugh.

[01:25:39] Speaker 24: At least that's-

[01:25:40] Speaker 22: At least it's not a mispostage. It's not sealed.

[01:25:42] Speaker 18: Yeah. Uh, 21 to hit. That went.

[01:25:45] Speaker 23: Nice.

[01:25:46] Speaker 22: All right. Is it a-

[01:25:47] Speaker 25: You're jacking the big guy?

[01:25:48] Speaker 18: Yeah.

[01:25:49] Speaker 23: Yeah.

[01:25:49] Speaker 18: 21 hits.

[01:25:50] Speaker 22: All right. (dice drops) (smacks lips) No one else has been even hurt yet.

[01:25:55] Speaker 18: Well, ooh, yeah. Very badly.

[01:25:59] Speaker 22: Okay. (dice drops) And that is a total of 10 damage.

[01:26:03] Speaker 23: Just, oh, it was bad enough that we killed him. (laughs) That's true.

[01:26:06] Speaker 18: (laughs) They're very hurt.

[01:26:08] Speaker 23: Who?

[01:26:08] Speaker 18: Um, their ancestors are hurt.

[01:26:09] Speaker 22: And I don't think it'll matter, but I was using cold iron.

[01:26:12] Speaker 18: Can you call them hurt anymore?

[01:26:13] Speaker 22: So, the needle darts spell, um, imparts any special properties of the metal that forms them and-

[01:26:19] Speaker 18: Oh.

[01:26:19] Speaker 22: Like, I actually have to have metal present. So, as part of my starting gear, I bought a chunk of cold iron.

[01:26:24] Speaker 18: Okay. Yup.

[01:26:25] Speaker 22: So... I also have silver coins-

[01:26:27] Speaker 18: (laughs)

[01:26:27] Speaker 22: ... that I can use. The needles come back and put themselves back where they were at the end of the attack, so it's, uh-

[01:26:35] Speaker 23: You have unlimited cold iron. (laughs)

[01:26:36] Speaker 22: I only, I only have to buy one chunk and I can use it forever.

[01:26:39] Speaker 18: Yeah.

[01:26:40] Speaker 22: For-

[01:26:40] Speaker 18: That's a really useful spell.

[01:26:42] Speaker 22: Yeah. But it also means I'm not devaluing my silver coins by using them-

[01:26:46] Speaker 18: (laughs)

[01:26:46] Speaker 25: Have they all action-

[01:26:47] Speaker 22: If I need to do silver.

[01:26:48] Speaker 18: No, I think one and two went next.

[01:26:50] Speaker 23: Yeah, one and two go next.

[01:26:52] Speaker 18: Oh.

[01:26:52] Speaker 23: And then it's your turn.

[01:26:53] Speaker 18: Um, let's see. One.

[01:26:55] Speaker 22: But it's a, it's an if-

[01:26:56] Speaker 18: Well, w- one is dead, right?

[01:26:58] Speaker 23: Yes.

[01:26:59] Speaker 18: One is dead. So, two is the one that can go. You're the closest one. He would try to get in to flank.

[01:27:06] Speaker 22: Yeah, that's fine.

[01:27:07] Speaker 18: So, if you have an attack of opportunity, you- Not on this one.

[01:27:09] Speaker 22: (coughs)

[01:27:09] Speaker 18: He will take a swing at you. Uh, that'd be a 23 with flank.

[01:27:17] Speaker 23: That'll hit.

[01:27:17] Speaker 18: Oh. One thing you just gotta... A good useful thing is t- when you make your attack rolls against me, so I don't forget, if you're in flank, say it's, uh, 18 plus flank. That'll just give me a reminder so I don't forget, um, that, so...

[01:27:29] Speaker 23: Oh, that's a good call.

[01:27:29] Speaker 18: They would have a 23 plus flank against you.

[01:27:31] Speaker 23: Yeah, I have AC18 right now.

[01:27:33] Speaker 18: So, so... He zaps you-

[01:27:35] Speaker 23: Not, not bad.

[01:27:35] Speaker 18: ... with a knee for two points of damage.

[01:27:37] Speaker 23: Motherfucker.

[01:27:37] Speaker 18: Mother dog slicer.

[01:27:40] Speaker 23: Oh, you little one. I'm gonna getcha.

[01:27:43] Speaker 18: He looks at you. He had some success. He thinks he can back that up with a not success. That'd be 12.

[01:27:49] Speaker 23: Yeah.

[01:27:49] Speaker 18: Just misses. Um, that's it for them. I think you were up next.

[01:27:54] Speaker 23: Yep.

[01:27:54] Speaker 25: So we know what-

[01:27:55] Speaker 26: Katie's next.

[01:27:55] Speaker 25: I know what kind of creature they are, so.

[01:27:57] Speaker 18: Oh, yeah. You can... These are very similar. Maybe a little bit bigger than the ones you had, you killed earlier, but they're very similar. You know they're goblins.

[01:28:04] Speaker 23: You killed the ones earlier?

[01:28:06] Speaker 25: No, but I know-

[01:28:07] Speaker 23: (gasps)

[01:28:07] Speaker 25: ... that they're goblins.

[01:28:08] Speaker 18: (laughs)

[01:28:09] Speaker 23: Uh, next, after Katie, is a bunch of your guys, five, six, then the orc and then the Fjord.

[01:28:12] Speaker 18: Oh, there's this GM voice in the sky that's like, "They're very much like the ones you killed." I'm reading, uh, I started reading Dungeon Crawler Carl.

[01:28:18] Speaker 22: Oh, such a good book.

[01:28:20] Speaker 18: (laughs)

[01:28:20] Speaker 22: I haven't read the most recent one, but I've read the rest of-

[01:28:22] Speaker 18: I still have book one.

[01:28:23] Speaker 22: But I've read the rest of the series.

[01:28:24] Speaker 18: It's on, it's on level two.

[01:28:25] Speaker 22: Yeah.

[01:28:26] Speaker 18: It's a... If you haven't read it and you want a weird, fun book-

[01:28:29] Speaker 22: It's a fun one.

[01:28:30] Speaker 18: It's a... So, spoiler of the first, like, 15 pages. Uh, aliens show up at the Earth and kill everybody who was inside a building, but this guy named Carl was outside 'cause his cat ran out the window.

[01:28:43] Speaker 22: (laughs)

[01:28:43] Speaker 18: And so he's not killed. Um, and the aliens announce that they are taking over the planet, but the Earth, earthlings can keep the planet if somebody can make it through an 18-level world dungeon. They create a world dungeon that is pretty much a video game.

[01:28:55] Speaker 22: And then they treat it like it's a, uh, reality show.

[01:28:59] Speaker 18: And it's a-

[01:28:59] Speaker 22: (laughs)

[01:28:59] Speaker 18: You know, Hunger Games, Survivor-style, like, televised video game where you can... It's a... The Hunger Games thing is you can have patrons that will send you loot boxes.

[01:29:10] Speaker 25: (laughs)

[01:29:10] Speaker 18: There's loot boxes.

[01:29:11] Speaker 22: There's literal loot boxes.

[01:29:12] Speaker 18: There's XP. There's magic spell. Like it's-

[01:29:15] Speaker 22: It's, it's one of a-

[01:29:15] Speaker 18: It's fucking hilarious.

[01:29:16] Speaker 22: Mm-hmm.

[01:29:16] Speaker 18: And I won't tell you anything else about the plot-

[01:29:18] Speaker 27: Who's the author?

[01:29:19] Speaker 22: I can't remember his name. Um, it's one of the best lit RPGs.

[01:29:23] Speaker 27: Dunge- Dungeon Crawl Carl.

[01:29:24] Speaker 18: Dungeon Crawler Carl.

[01:29:26] Speaker 22: Dungeon Crawler Carl.

[01:29:27] Speaker 23: Dungeon Crawler Carl is the... And there's like-

[01:29:28] Speaker 22: He's, he's DCed.

[01:29:29] Speaker 18: ... seven books?

[01:29:30] Speaker 22: Yeah.

[01:29:30] Speaker 18: I saw the description of the seventh book and k- know that the... it's probably like a level per book since the seventh-

[01:29:39] Speaker 22: Probably, yeah.

[01:29:40] Speaker 18: ... book is level nine.

[01:29:41] Speaker 25: (laughs)

[01:29:42] Speaker 18: And I'm assuming the first book is one, two and three, which leaves one level for the next six books.

[01:29:46] Speaker 22: The author has promised-

[01:29:47] Speaker 18: Matt Dimoun.

[01:29:48] Speaker 22: ... that a single level will never take more than one book.

[01:29:51] Speaker 18: Okay.

[01:29:52] Speaker 22: So-

[01:29:52] Speaker 18: Oh.

[01:29:53] Speaker 22: Uh, but you could theoretically clear more than one level-

[01:29:56] Speaker 18: And you know, on a, on a single book. It's also slightly a spoiler to, like, chapter three or something like that. But-

[01:30:01] Speaker 25: Huh.

[01:30:01] Speaker 18: This isn't the first time this has happened. It's happened on lots of planets 'cause there turns out to be billions of planets in the universe. And so this is-

[01:30:07] Speaker 22: And it's just a group which is just Earth.

[01:30:08] Speaker 18: Which is why it's o- ongoing TV series and no one has ever won the game.

[01:30:12] Speaker 22: So-

[01:30:13] Speaker 23: Nope.

[01:30:14] Speaker 22: It's hilarious.

[01:30:14] Speaker 25: If I make everyone acknowledge-

[01:30:16] Speaker 23: It's one of the best Lit RPGs out there.

[01:30:16] Speaker 25: ... against a creature and identify what it is and succeed, it becomes off guard. Would that m- m- make sense doing here or no, since you're-

[01:30:26] Speaker 18: You still have to do a... I think you have to use that in combat. So, yeah, you'd have to do your recall knowledge.Um, I think it's the... I think you have to take an action to do that. And then, I don't know if this goes against all goblins. Um, it might. I can't remember exactly but...

[01:30:39] Speaker 28: Okay. Well, I'm gonna-

[01:30:40] Speaker 18: Because now you're probably doing a recall knowledge versus their combat abilities and whatnot.

[01:30:43] Speaker 28: Yeah, I'm gonna, uh, do a recall knowledge on number two. This would be what kind, what, uh, society?

[01:30:53] Speaker 18: Um, for these guys, nature. It doesn't matter when you're level one.

[01:30:59] Speaker 28: 15 plus two.

[01:31:00] Speaker 18: Like my trained nature is only-

[01:31:02] Speaker 28: Uh, yeah.

[01:31:02] Speaker 18: ... plus one.

[01:31:03] Speaker 28: You're right.

[01:31:03] Speaker 18: That is when you're level 10, you're gonna lose, if you're not trained.

[01:31:06] Speaker 28: That's true.

[01:31:06] Speaker 18: But got level one, level natural.

[01:31:07] Speaker 28: Not used, used to high level stuff. We gotta go back to level one. (laughs)

[01:31:11] Speaker 18: Um, we'll give it to you on this one.

[01:31:14] Speaker 28: Okay.

[01:31:14] Speaker 18: You know that they're orcs. Um, what kind of knowledge did you wanna know?

[01:31:17] Speaker 28: Uh, what are they immune to?

[01:31:22] Speaker 18: Goblins? Um, in a sense you can just say strengths or weaknesses. So if you're looking for like, um, strengths-

[01:31:26] Speaker 28: Oh.

[01:31:26] Speaker 18: ... stuff they're immune to. Um, pretty much nothing. Um-

[01:31:29] Speaker 28: Uh, okay. Okay, well, since I succeeded, it's number two is off guard.

[01:31:38] Speaker 18: Okay. (yawning) Now I have to look at the ability. I wonder if you get that against all?

[01:31:42] Speaker 28: But was that a crit succeed or just-

[01:31:44] Speaker 18: No, just-

[01:31:45] Speaker 28: Okay. So it's-

[01:31:46] Speaker 18: So is the number two off guard for everyone or just for you on this turn?

[01:31:49] Speaker 28: Just for me.

[01:31:50] Speaker 18: Yeah.

[01:31:50] Speaker 28: I believe.

[01:31:51] Speaker 18: And I think it gives her a precision damage too. This is a big guy.

[01:31:53] Speaker 1: Shh, we're not supposed to know. She's a rogue.

[01:31:57] Speaker 28: You don't know anything.

[01:31:59] Speaker 29: It's rogue mechanics.

[01:32:00] Speaker 28: So, okay. I mean, uh-

[01:32:01] Speaker 29: I'm pretty sure it's just the one target.

[01:32:02] Speaker 28: I wanna-

[01:32:02] Speaker 29: 'Cause I played around with it.

[01:32:04] Speaker 28: Okay. I'm gonna pull out a hand crossbow-

[01:32:05] Speaker 29: You have to do it every round.

[01:32:06] Speaker 28: ... and shoot it at number two.

[01:32:07] Speaker 29: Every turn, okay. Until you... Only one action to pull out the crossbow and your third action to shoot.

[01:32:11] Speaker 18: Mm-hmm.

[01:32:13] Speaker 1: That's a good roll.

[01:32:18] Speaker 28: 25.

[01:32:19] Speaker 18: Tell us about off, off guard.

[01:32:21] Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, plus off guard.

[01:32:23] Speaker 18: He gets a crit.

[01:32:24] Speaker 28: Yay.

[01:32:24] Speaker 18: Yeah, I was gonna say, that should be...

[01:32:26] Speaker 29: (laughs)

[01:32:26] Speaker 18: Who are you going for?

[01:32:27] Speaker 28: Number two.

[01:32:28] Speaker 18: Number two?

[01:32:28] Speaker 29: I'm gonna take-

[01:32:29] Speaker 18: The one closest to her?

[01:32:30] Speaker 28: 1d6.

[01:32:31] Speaker 18: You're the redhead?

[01:32:32] Speaker 29: Mm-hmm.

[01:32:32] Speaker 28: Ye- yeah.

[01:32:34] Speaker 18: Is that a cloak or a red hair?

[01:32:35] Speaker 29: Red hair.

[01:32:36] Speaker 18: Okay. I don't remember what you look like.

[01:32:38] Speaker 29: Well, it's a little different than that.

[01:32:40] Speaker 18: Okay, whatever.

[01:32:42] Speaker 28: Wait. Nine points of damage.

[01:32:51] Speaker 18: That's with crit or doubling it?

[01:32:53] Speaker 28: Uh, no.

[01:32:53] Speaker 18: No, he has-

[01:32:54] Speaker 28: Uh, 18 points of damage.

[01:32:55] Speaker 18: Oh, well, nice. Spoiler, it's dead.

[01:32:58] Speaker 29: (laughs)

[01:32:59] Speaker 18: I took less than that and killed one.

[01:33:00] Speaker 29: Little guy just stabbed you in the, in the leg and is staring at that all of a sudden just, you know, splatters-

[01:33:06] Speaker 18: Crossbow bolt comes out the front of his face.

[01:33:08] Speaker 29: (laughs)

[01:33:08] Speaker 28: I was gonna say, yeah, crossbow bolt right through the eye.

[01:33:10] Speaker 18: Mm-hmm.

[01:33:11] Speaker 28: Through the-

[01:33:12] Speaker 18: You shot him in the back of the head, so...

[01:33:14] Speaker 29: (laughs)

[01:33:15] Speaker 28: Back of the head comes out the eye.

[01:33:17] Speaker 30: Whoa. Um, that head was very close to my knee.

[01:33:20] Speaker 28: (laughs)

[01:33:21] Speaker 18: (laughs)

[01:33:21] Speaker 28: And that is my turn.

[01:33:23] Speaker 18: You know collateral damage, it goes into your knee.

[01:33:25] Speaker 28: (laughs)

[01:33:26] Speaker 18: You took an arrow to the knee and you can't be

[01:33:27] Speaker 31: I know, but I want to be an adventurer. Um, five and six.

[01:33:32] Speaker 18: Is your, uh, the creature on your shoulder named, uh, Princess Donut?

[01:33:38] Speaker 29: (laughs)

[01:33:39] Speaker 30: What's that?

[01:33:40] Speaker 29: That's, that's Carl's cat.

[01:33:42] Speaker 18: The cat's name.

[01:33:43] Speaker 29: Which-

[01:33:44] Speaker 18: It's got a longer name than that but-

[01:33:45] Speaker 29: Princess Donut?

[01:33:46] Speaker 18: It's Princess Donut.

[01:33:46] Speaker 29: Princess Donut.

[01:33:47] Speaker 18: His, his ex-girlfriend named her.

[01:33:49] Speaker 29: Yeah.

[01:33:49] Speaker 18: She was a show cat, like, you know dog shows?

[01:33:51] Speaker 29: Yeah.

[01:33:52] Speaker 18: They apparently they have cat shows now.

[01:33:53] Speaker 29: They do have cat shows.

[01:33:53] Speaker 18: Go into flank with you. Make two attacks.

[01:33:56] Speaker 30: This again? What the hell?

[01:33:58] Speaker 29: Champion.

[01:33:59] Speaker 18: 20.

[01:33:59] Speaker 29: Plus flank.

[01:34:00] Speaker 30: That hits.

[01:34:01] Speaker 18: Five points.

[01:34:02] Speaker 30: Okay.

[01:34:04] Speaker 18: And his second attack.

[01:34:05] Speaker 30: She's grown on me, I hate on that.

[01:34:07] Speaker 18: He might have... Well, with flank and might.

[01:34:08] Speaker 29: She, she grows on ya.

[01:34:10] Speaker 18: Um, be an 18 plus flank.

[01:34:12] Speaker 29: Yeah, that would hit.

[01:34:13] Speaker 18: Two points. Other guy is going to move up.

[01:34:17] Speaker 30: I am out of stamina.

[01:34:20] Speaker 18: With you, he's now in flank with you.

[01:34:22] Speaker 29: What does stamina do? Oh.

[01:34:23] Speaker 18: Takes damage before hit points?

[01:34:25] Speaker 29: Right, I forgot. We didn't use it in the other campaign.

[01:34:28] Speaker 28: Yeah, that's one of the kind of things you choose.

[01:34:28] Speaker 18: In the mini campaign that you didn't do.

[01:34:30] Speaker 29: (coughs)

[01:34:31] Speaker 18: If you click on stamina and add the damage, the game will automatically-

[01:34:36] Speaker 29: Roll in-

[01:34:36] Speaker 18: ... roll in the other hit points when needed.

[01:34:38] Speaker 29: Yeah.

[01:34:38] Speaker 18: So you always apply damage to your stamina and it'll do the math.

[01:34:41] Speaker 29: Thank you.

[01:34:41] Speaker 18: What it means is too, is when you take a rest, 10-minute rest, you automatically get all your stamina back.

[01:34:45] Speaker 30: You gotta use a resolve point though.

[01:34:47] Speaker 18: Yeah, you gotta use a resolve point. You have so many of those per day.

[01:34:49] Speaker 29: Uh, x times per day.

[01:34:50] Speaker 30: Yeah.

[01:34:50] Speaker 29: Depending on probably your constitution. I don't know what it is.

[01:34:52] Speaker 1: But if you do healing, healing does not heal stamina. It only heals health damage. So, something to remember if you're healing, it can only he- up to your health damage. You can't go in and start healing stamina too.

[01:35:02] Speaker 18: So if you run out of resolve points, you kind of are...

[01:35:05] Speaker 28: As well.

[01:35:06] Speaker 18: It's to limit the number of times you can recover completely in a single day.

[01:35:09] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[01:35:09] Speaker 18: You have to sleep to get your resolve back.

[01:35:10] Speaker 1: Ideally, it kind of makes it similar to mages.

[01:35:12] Speaker 29: Like short rests from fighting.

[01:35:14] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[01:35:14] Speaker 29: I get the idea.

[01:35:15] Speaker 1: But no, it makes it a little bit more even for the party, so it's so that fighters also have to have a reason to rest now, like mages do. Um, I just... So, um, that's what he does.

[01:35:25] Speaker 18: What did you... Did you, you moved but did, did you attack and miss?

[01:35:28] Speaker 1: He attacked, I don't know what I rolled, so I roll again. I can't remember if I did roll or not, so this will be a 23 plus flank.

[01:35:37] Speaker 18: Just hit two points.

[01:35:40] Speaker 1: The second attack on you, 11 plus flank.

[01:35:46] Speaker 18: Nope.

[01:35:47] Speaker 1: That was his high damage roll.

[01:35:48] Speaker 18: Okay. Next is the orc.

[01:35:51] Speaker 1: Uh, he's always wanted to take on one of your kind. He takes a step up.

[01:35:57] Speaker 29: (laughs)

[01:35:59] Speaker 18: Bring it on, come on.

[01:36:00] Speaker 1: Oh, let's see what he has. He has a weapon. Actually, no. Let's see, I'm trying to remember sweep. Does sweep have to be adjacent enemies?

[01:36:16] Speaker 18: Hmm, no.

[01:36:17] Speaker 1: Or just any enemy that's, that's next to you?

[01:36:20] Speaker 18: I think they have to be adjacent to you.

[01:36:23] Speaker 1: Oh.

[01:36:24] Speaker 18: No, sweep is not... It's not two enemies at once. Sweep is if you make a second attack and the second attack is on a different target, then it gets a bonus.

[01:36:34] Speaker 1: Okay.

[01:36:34] Speaker 18: Yeah.

[01:36:34] Speaker 1: He'll move there 'cause that way he's adjacent to both you guys. He'll make his first attack on you. Uh...Um, he will miss horribly.

[01:36:43] Speaker 8: And then if it's, if, if he's making a different attack on a different one, the second one gets a plus one instead, you know?

[01:36:48] Speaker 1: Okay. He'll... But only if he hits the first time?

[01:36:51] Speaker 8: No.

[01:36:51] Speaker 1: Well, okay. He will make a second attack on you.

[01:36:53] Speaker 8: You just get... You're incentivized to spread your attacks.

[01:36:55] Speaker 13: Yeah, if you already attempted attack is the wording.

[01:36:58] Speaker 8: Yes.

[01:36:58] Speaker 1: So, he knows I never fought an orca like you before. I'll take a swing at you. Big, ugly, scaly ork, and that's also gonna miss.

[01:37:05] Speaker 13: He is so stupid.

[01:37:05] Speaker 1: That's all for his action.

[01:37:06] Speaker 13: He's just... He's so dumb.

[01:37:09] Speaker 1: (laughs) Orcs is not known for their intelligence.

[01:37:11] Speaker 8: It is the- it is the destiny of nature for some creatures to have less.

[01:37:16] Speaker 1: Um, in between rounds, um, he'll... They'll basically both move up-

[01:37:22] Speaker 32: (laughs)

[01:37:23] Speaker 1: ... and start fighting. Some of these guys here won't do anything but-

[01:37:27] Speaker 13: I have three.

[01:37:27] Speaker 1: They'll back you up.

[01:37:29] Speaker 33: Is this a gap in the wall right here?

[01:37:30] Speaker 1: No, it just kind of-

[01:37:31] Speaker 8: There's just walls all the way around.

[01:37:32] Speaker 13: Yeah.

[01:37:32] Speaker 33: Oh, man.

[01:37:34] Speaker 8: Use your imagination.

[01:37:35] Speaker 33: Mm-hmm.

[01:37:35] Speaker 13: Three and four is up next.

[01:37:37] Speaker 1: It is climbable.

[01:37:38] Speaker 8: I mean, it's a high wall. You can't jump over it.

[01:37:39] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[01:37:39] Speaker 8: It's like 10 feet tall or something.

[01:37:40] Speaker 33: Mm-hmm.

[01:37:40] Speaker 1: Yeah, it's about 10... Well, I'd say probably six or seven. It's, it's fairly tolerably taller. But you could climb over it, there are openings. There are spikes and stuff on top to keep you from climbing over but it is doable for a double help. Plus you spend all of your life climbing. Um, anyway, next up.

[01:37:56] Speaker 13: Three and four.

[01:37:57] Speaker 1: Three and four?

[01:37:57] Speaker 8: I think they're dead.

[01:37:58] Speaker 13: Three and four is dead, yeah.

[01:37:59] Speaker 8: Is this one?

[01:38:00] Speaker 1: This three?

[01:38:00] Speaker 8: He's the one in the middle of the-

[01:38:01] Speaker 1: He's the one in the middle. Oh, he's got it. He's got a restrictive environment there. Um, we'll do one, two, three, four.

[01:38:06] Speaker 8: Is the guy who's not fighting providing flank? He is.

[01:38:10] Speaker 1: Oh, he is. Yeah, he would go for the flank.

[01:38:13] Speaker 8: Because he

[01:38:13] Speaker 34: Count.

[01:38:13] Speaker 1: What's that? Um, yeah, he would go for the guy that he's flanking.

[01:38:16] Speaker 8: Mm-hmm.

[01:38:17] Speaker 1: He's smart enough to know that. Actually, it's two guys he's flanking.

[01:38:19] Speaker 8: Two guys.

[01:38:19] Speaker 34: That's not what I meant. I meant the... Our MPC ally is causing flank on number three. Do I get the benefit of the flank?

[01:38:25] Speaker 1: Yeah, I'd say so.

[01:38:26] Speaker 34: He's, he's just a non-combatant.

[01:38:27] Speaker 1: He's, he's fighting them. No, he's fighting them. I'm just not adding him into it for time's sake.

[01:38:30] Speaker 8: But he does threaten him.

[01:38:32] Speaker 1: Yeah. That's probably the reason why they moved there so they could at least provide.

[01:38:35] Speaker 8: Yeah.

[01:38:36] Speaker 1: Um, so he has two, so even and odd. So even and odd. Even, he's going after you. Um, wow, that is a 13 plus flank.

[01:38:48] Speaker 8: Misses.

[01:38:50] Speaker 1: Um, he'll take a second attack at you. Yeah, it's a 12 plus flank.

[01:38:56] Speaker 8: Misses.

[01:38:57] Speaker 1: Um, having missed horribly, he's just going to look at you growl and he's going to try to bite you instead. And that is a one plus flank.

[01:39:04] Speaker 32: (laughs)

[01:39:04] Speaker 1: So that's actually (laughs) probably that's probably negative something plus flank. Um, so he is done.

[01:39:09] Speaker 8: Okay.

[01:39:10] Speaker 1: And I think four is dead.

[01:39:11] Speaker 13: Okay, next is me, Irv is on deck. Um, I'm gonna stare at the ork and be like, "You really should not have come here, partner." I don't know why I'm talking like a Western. I am not maintaining that. (laughs)

[01:39:24] Speaker 1: Um, hey, if I can't do a M- Cockney accent, whatever accent you're going for, I give you grace, but yeah.

[01:39:28] Speaker 13: Um, so I'm gonna do an intimidation check, the coerce or-

[01:39:31] Speaker 1: Oh, oh yeah.

[01:39:32] Speaker 13: ... demoralize.

[01:39:33] Speaker 1: Uh, that is a nat one, so he's probably not very demoralized.

[01:39:36] Speaker 32: Oh.

[01:39:37] Speaker 33: Yeah.

[01:39:38] Speaker 13: Um, so my main attack or first attack, I'll go for number five just to hopefully get rid of some of this annoying flanking. Um, so that is a cool 18 to hit.

[01:39:53] Speaker 1: 18 hits.

[01:39:54] Speaker 13: And that is eight bludgeoning and three spirit.

[01:39:58] Speaker 1: Okay, he goes splat.

[01:40:00] Speaker 13: Good. Uh, second attack. Hmm, I'll go for the little guy. But you were flanking with him, so you'd be more efficient going on that one.

[01:40:14] Speaker 8: He is flanking me, too. I'm fine if you wanna kill him.

[01:40:18] Speaker 13: Yeah, but you're gonna go before him.

[01:40:19] Speaker 8: I'm not gonna attack.

[01:40:20] Speaker 13: Okay, 'cause I wanted to talk about our strategy. Mm.

[01:40:26] Speaker 8: We're not gonna talk about it.

[01:40:28] Speaker 13: He goes odds. Odds, I'm going for the little guy. Uh, yeah, 18 plus stuff. Tw- dirty 20 to hit.

[01:40:38] Speaker 1: Okay, yeah.

[01:40:38] Speaker 13: And 11 on the dice, so that's, uh, 16 bludgeoning and 30 spirit.

[01:40:42] Speaker 8: And that was number three?

[01:40:43] Speaker 13: Yep.

[01:40:44] Speaker 8: Okay, he goes splat. And that is my turn. Flurry of blows on the boss and Matthew's on deck.

[01:40:55] Speaker 1: You're lowest first. Um, that is a 21 and a miss, so-

[01:41:03] Speaker 8: 21 will hit.

[01:41:04] Speaker 1: That is nine points of bludgeoning damage.

[01:41:09] Speaker 13: He only gets six alone?

[01:41:12] Speaker 1: Yep.

[01:41:13] Speaker 13: Get them in the boss.

[01:41:14] Speaker 1: I'm going to, uh, fish for a 20 on a trip attempt on the boss. No, that is a five.

[01:41:24] Speaker 8: Oh.

[01:41:25] Speaker 1: Yeah, not quite.

[01:41:25] Speaker 8: (laughs)

[01:41:26] Speaker 1: Whatever it is, it's plus 10. So unless he's got a minus six on his... Was it reflex for tripping?

[01:41:32] Speaker 8: No, he's pretty good.

[01:41:33] Speaker 1: Or-

[01:41:34] Speaker 8: He's decent at that.

[01:41:34] Speaker 1: But what is re- tripping? Is it reflex or is it, uh, fortitude?

[01:41:38] Speaker 8: Reflex, I'm pretty sure.

[01:41:39] Speaker 1: Um, and my third action is to be defensive.

[01:41:41] Speaker 8: I think tripping was that and I think pushing is for it.

[01:41:44] Speaker 1: Okay. Par- parrying for my third action.

[01:41:47] Speaker 8: Oh, yeah.

[01:41:48] Speaker 13: Matthew, Katie's on deck.

[01:41:51] Speaker 35: Okay. Uh, with my first action, I'm going to cast Sure Strike, which essentially gives me advantage on my next attack roll. And then I'm gonna do needle darts again on the guy in charge. Is there even anything left besides the ork?

[01:42:08] Speaker 1: Yeah, there's one guy.

[01:42:09] Speaker 34: There's six. Yeah.

[01:42:10] Speaker 35: I'm doing the ork.

[01:42:11] Speaker 13: I don't think you have to worry about him.

[01:42:13] Speaker 8: He will, uh, tell the story of what happened here when his family is all wiped out.

[01:42:18] Speaker 1: Well, he's not gonna be able to tell the story because he's going to die here.

[01:42:21] Speaker 35: 15?

[01:42:23] Speaker 1: On the ork?

[01:42:23] Speaker 35: Yep.

[01:42:23] Speaker 1: Uh, no.

[01:42:24] Speaker 35: Ah.

[01:42:25] Speaker 1: He's a bit higher.

[01:42:26] Speaker 35: All right. Well, then that's my whole turn.

[01:42:28] Speaker 1: He has a good proper orcish armor.

[01:42:30] Speaker 8: Who's left?

[01:42:31] Speaker 32: Can I see the ork-

[01:42:33] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[01:42:33] Speaker 32: ... the boss dude from where I'm standing?

[01:42:35] Speaker 1: Yeah, he's gonna have cover because we have

[01:42:37] Speaker 36: There's a... It's a wall way.

[01:42:38] Speaker 32: Mm-hmm.

[01:42:38] Speaker 8: Is she tall enough to see over the wall?

[01:42:39] Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

[01:42:40] Speaker 32: No.

[01:42:40] Speaker 8: Oh, okay.

[01:42:41] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[01:42:42] Speaker 8: I mean, I don't give a mil-

[01:42:43] Speaker 1: Yeah, I can see-

[01:42:44] Speaker 8: I'd say you can see him but he's definitely gonna have cover.

[01:42:47] Speaker 13: Crap, your guys are on deck.

[01:42:48] Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

[01:42:51] Speaker 37: Oh.

[01:43:00] Speaker 38: I'm trying to make... Do I have to do this recall ability ever, for every target?

[01:43:04] Speaker 1: I'll have to look up. For him, you definitely would, 'cause it's... Orcs are different than-

[01:43:09] Speaker 16: Yeah.

[01:43:11] Speaker 1: An orc versus a goblin.

[01:43:14] Speaker 38: Do you sneak attack if you have allies standing, like, threatening nearby?

[01:43:20] Speaker 1: Um, in melee. If... Melee, if you're the opposite side. So, if you move-

[01:43:24] Speaker 16: No. It's not fifth edition rules.

[01:43:26] Speaker 37: Yeah.

[01:43:26] Speaker 38: Okay.

[01:43:27] Speaker 1: So, like, if you, if you wanted to flank him in melee, you'd have to be standing here and have an ally on the other side. If, for... Uh, shooting it's a little bit harder. That's why you have that ability which kind of lets you do it.

[01:43:38] Speaker 38: Yeah.

[01:43:38] Speaker 1: But you have to spend an action to do it. I'd say once you... And Orc may not work since he's played a rogue, but... So is it that once you get that-

[01:43:44] Speaker 16: I mean, I didn't play that one.

[01:43:45] Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

[01:43:45] Speaker 16: I didn't play that, whatever it's called, subclass.

[01:43:47] Speaker 1: But I mean, I th- I would take it that if you pass that once on an orc, like if you pass it on him, then you'd always have it for the rest of the combat, on that orc.

[01:43:56] Speaker 38: Hmm.

[01:43:56] Speaker 1: I'll have to re- I'll have to read the exact ability eventually, to see what it's like.

[01:43:59] Speaker 38: Yeah. I'm gonna do a recall knowledge and then make it. Um, let's see.

[01:44:02] Speaker 16: Yeah. It says that if you recall knowledge, the creature is tha- the- that creature is off-guard until the start of your next turn. You have to do it every turn.

[01:44:10] Speaker 38: Hmm.

[01:44:11] Speaker 16: Um, if you critically succeed, it's for a minute.

[01:44:15] Speaker 1: Oh.

[01:44:15] Speaker 38: Six pl- uh, nature again?

[01:44:18] Speaker 1: Um, orcs are... society.

[01:44:24] Speaker 38: So six plus six.

[01:44:30] Speaker 1: Um, yeah. Well, you got a basic.

[01:44:34] Speaker 38: Okay. Then I'm gonna attack him.

[01:44:36] Speaker 1: And what did you wanna know about him?

[01:44:37] Speaker 38: Oh. What is... What are his strengths?

[01:44:43] Speaker 1: Hmm. You know that he, uh... Or, so strengths would be, he doesn't have any... Let me see.

[01:44:52] Speaker 38: A class with this.

[01:44:59] Speaker 1: He really doesn't have any, um, immunities or, uh, resistances.

[01:45:06] Speaker 38: Hmm. Okay, well, bring it.

[01:45:08] Speaker 16: So, he doesn't have-

[01:45:09] Speaker 1: He has big armor.

[01:45:10] Speaker 16: (laughs)

[01:45:10] Speaker 38: Oh, that probably doesn't hit. That's, uh, eight.

[01:45:16] Speaker 1: No.

[01:45:16] Speaker 38: Mm-mm.

[01:45:16] Speaker 1: It's an eight.

[01:45:17] Speaker 16: Eight? Okay. Well, it'd be eight plus-

[01:45:19] Speaker 38: And that'll roll the two.

[01:45:19] Speaker 16: No.

[01:45:20] Speaker 1: Oh, yeah. (laughs)

[01:45:20] Speaker 16: That's the, that's the, with the bonus.

[01:45:23] Speaker 1: Um, we got a hit.

[01:45:24] Speaker 16: Yeah, yeah. The two on the die just misses.

[01:45:26] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[01:45:27] Speaker 38: Yeah. Okay. Well, that's a 10.

[01:45:29] Speaker 1: He has, uh... Yeah, you got a hero point.

[01:45:33] Speaker 38: I do have... Yeah, you sure?

[01:45:35] Speaker 1: The reason I have a timer set here, so there will be more.

[01:45:37] Speaker 38: It's not lost on me. We'll roll again.

[01:45:38] Speaker 16: Yeah. Shit, so nevermind.

[01:45:40] Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

[01:45:40] Speaker 16: I should've thought about that.

[01:45:41] Speaker 39: I could have re-rode my needle, though.

[01:45:42] Speaker 38: 15.

[01:45:43] Speaker 39: Keep forgetting about that.

[01:45:45] Speaker 1: Uh, 15 with-

[01:45:45] Speaker 38: Plus, um, off guard.

[01:45:47] Speaker 1: Off-guard. Um, still no. He has a pretty decent size armor on.

[01:45:50] Speaker 38: Okay.

[01:45:51] Speaker 1: It goes plink. But it was much better-

[01:45:52] Speaker 39: What's the name of the ability that gives me the plus one?

[01:45:55] Speaker 1: Um, next up. Oh, I think it was my guys.

[01:45:58] Speaker 38: Yeah.

[01:45:58] Speaker 39: Sorry.

[01:45:58] Speaker 1: Nudge, feint.

[01:45:59] Speaker 39: That's right.

[01:46:00] Speaker 38: And they run into where after me?

[01:46:01] Speaker 39: I think the first six, then they work.

[01:46:03] Speaker 38: Maybe one of them-

[01:46:04] Speaker 39: One a day. ... one of them's, no.

[01:46:05] Speaker 1: I think it's like all of them, the two that are left.

[01:46:08] Speaker 16: Little guy and then big guy.

[01:46:09] Speaker 1: He's gonna step... Well, he's gonna make an attack first. He's gonna try his sweep attack again.

[01:46:14] Speaker 39: Technically, six is an initiative before. I won't be there.

[01:46:17] Speaker 1: Oh.

[01:46:17] Speaker 16: Little guy.

[01:46:17] Speaker 1: Um, little guy? Yeah, he will, he will step up in a flank. He'll stare at you. Um, use a scaly orc with a tail. It makes no sense to him but, what does...? You know, he's only a few months old. There could be orcs with tails. You're green, you must be an orc. That is a 14 plus flank.

[01:46:37] Speaker 16: Nope.

[01:46:39] Speaker 1: Um, he was a tough orc with a tail. And-

[01:46:43] Speaker 16: More, uh-

[01:46:45] Speaker 1: And that will probably fail.

[01:46:46] Speaker 16: ... more fail dodgy than tough. Although, also have tough skin with odd-looking scales.

[01:46:52] Speaker 1: Oh, yeah. Yeah, but he's not gonna be able to do it. The big orc guy is gonna go. He's gonna attack you first and turn flank, and he's gonna try to sweep into you. Um, against you first, that would be a 19 plus flank.

[01:47:09] Speaker 16: That hits with flank.

[01:47:11] Speaker 1: Um, oh, he does D8 instead of six. Mm. Um, that's where eight plus two plus four will get you down to.

[01:47:26] Speaker 16: Doesn't matter.

[01:47:27] Speaker 1: So, um, at any rate, that's, uh, 14.

[01:47:31] Speaker 16: I fall over.

[01:47:33] Speaker 1: Oh.

[01:47:34] Speaker 39: Um, I have avenging glory. When an ally becomes dying, I gain 10 HP. And, uh, thought I could make an attack when I did this, but maybe not. But I got 10 HP.

[01:47:45] Speaker 1: Oh. Hey, that's (laughs)... That's always good, 'cause then he's gonna go after you with his, uh, swing, or sweep. And that is gonna miss horribly.

[01:47:57] Speaker 16: Mm-hmm.

[01:47:57] Speaker 1: He's gonna say s-... Um, well, let's see. Does he... He will just make one more attack on you.

[01:48:04] Speaker 39: Um, I think he's happy with where he's at.

[01:48:09] Speaker 1: He'll probably need-

[01:48:09] Speaker 39: Didn't change my initiative to be right before him.

[01:48:11] Speaker 1: That'd be an 18 to hit you.

[01:48:13] Speaker 39: Okay. That would just hit.

[01:48:16] Speaker 1: Um, two plus six would be eight points of damage.

[01:48:23] Speaker 39: Okay. There goes the 10th HP.

[01:48:26] Speaker 1: (laughs) Honestly, that's really good, 'cause I, I played barbarians a lot.

[01:48:30] Speaker 39: Mm-hmm.

[01:48:30] Speaker 1: And that was a big thing with them, is that they just didn't have ways of getting more than 10 HP. As long as you have that.

[01:48:35] Speaker 39: All you needed was to keep dying.

[01:48:37] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[01:48:37] Speaker 39: (laughs)

[01:48:38] Speaker 1: (laughs)

[01:48:39] Speaker 39: Happy to oblige.

[01:48:40] Speaker 1: Mm-mm, mm-mm. Well, that's it for him. They're all gone, so it's up to you guys.

[01:48:45] Speaker 39: Okay. Uh, sorry about that. It's just, it's being weird and not deducting from the 10th HP source.

[01:48:50] Speaker 1: Oh. That's weird.

[01:48:57] Speaker 13: All right, my turn. Uh, I will intimidate that guy. That's cocked.

[01:49:05] Speaker 1: Did you try to intimidate him before?

[01:49:06] Speaker 13: Oh, yes, I did.

[01:49:07] Speaker 40: If he succeeds, he's immune for 24 hours.

[01:49:10] Speaker 13: Yeah.

[01:49:10] Speaker 1: Oh, then I guess

[01:49:10] Speaker 41: So, you can use the 1v1.

[01:49:11] Speaker 40: You gotta change targets every time, e- each time.

[01:49:13] Speaker 13: Okay. Um, I don't know if I would have bothered to intimidate the little guy.

[01:49:17] Speaker 1: You can just take him out.

[01:49:18] Speaker 13: Also, I'm biased because I just rolled a crit. (laughs)

[01:49:21] Speaker 1: (laughs)

[01:49:21] Speaker 13: I want to keep that for the attack roll, but that feels cheating, uh. (laughs) What'd you get? 6?

[01:49:28] Speaker 40: Just do a one hit.

[01:49:28] Speaker 13: Got that one. (laughs) Here's a hero point for you. (laughs) Run you away, you're too wild.

[01:49:35] Speaker 40: Too finicky.

[01:49:36] Speaker 13: Okay, that is an 11 to hit.

[01:49:39] Speaker 1: Ah.

[01:49:39] Speaker 13: Or, well, not 12 due to that, but it's still a one hit.

[01:49:41] Speaker 1: Yeah, that wouldn't hit.

[01:49:43] Speaker 13: All right, second attack. (die thudding) All right, um, yeah, that's only a, another 12 to hit.

[01:49:52] Speaker 1: Oh.

[01:49:52] Speaker 13: What was I going to do with my third attack? Hm, or third. I don't have healing, so err on your own. Uh, yeah, I'll make a third attack, maybe I pick, I'll get a 20. I did not. Um, yeah, that's my turn.

[01:50:09] Speaker 1: Okay, who's up?

[01:50:10] Speaker 13: Next is, uh, Matthew. Katie's on deck.

[01:50:15] Speaker 42: Okay, um. All right, I'm just going to cast needle darts again. (dice thudding) 17.

[01:50:34] Speaker 1: That would miss.

[01:50:35] Speaker 42: All right, um-

[01:50:37] Speaker 1: This guy's got pretty good armor.

[01:50:39] Speaker 42: And then shield.

[01:50:42] Speaker 1: Okay, next up, Katie.

[01:50:47] Speaker 13: Gets five and six are on deck, or does six.

[01:50:51] Speaker 42: Hmm. Um.

[01:51:03] Speaker 1: You're top of the order or bottom of the order?

[01:51:07] Speaker 43: I'm just going to take three shots at him.

[01:51:10] Speaker 1: What do you mean? Oh, 'cause the-

[01:51:12] Speaker 44: Can you reload in between? That's a crossbow.

[01:51:13] Speaker 43: Uh, that's true.

[01:51:14] Speaker 1: So you could choo- or do you reload from last time, so you might have to reload, shoot, reload.

[01:51:18] Speaker 43: Okay, reload, shoot, reload. Yep, that's fair. (die thudding) That was almost a one. 19?

[01:51:27] Speaker 1: Would just miss.

[01:51:28] Speaker 43: Oh. Okay.

[01:51:31] Speaker 1: Rarely enough if you did your recall knowledge thing, I would have been out.

[01:51:33] Speaker 43: Yeah, yeah, it would. Okay.

[01:51:37] Speaker 1: Um, next. I'm just saying, was it?

[01:51:39] Speaker 40: Yes.

[01:51:39] Speaker 1: So, is he the top or bottom of the order?

[01:51:42] Speaker 40: What do you mean by that?

[01:51:42] Speaker 1: The NPCs happen in between.

[01:51:44] Speaker 13: Oh, um-

[01:51:45] Speaker 40: So-

[01:51:45] Speaker 1: They happen in the inner...

[01:51:47] Speaker 13: Yeah, the NPCs would have gone after the orc last time.

[01:51:50] Speaker 1: Oh, okay. Um, I'll just have him move and then the other guys will go. Um, she would make her way around. She'll just dig a... Let's see. He's there. Well, he was in f- was he in front? No, he was side like that.

[01:52:10] Speaker 40: No, he was, yeah.

[01:52:11] Speaker 1: So yeah, she'll take a big sweeping thing to get into his flank. He is going to move up. Um, no, just move up to help try fighting the guy. That's it for them. So now six goes. Six wouldn't know any better. He's going to try to flank her. Takes a few shots at her. Um, I don't know what he can hit. Nope, never before and I don't know when. So, he takes some wild swings which he doesn't stand.

[01:52:43] Speaker 44: It's my turn.

[01:52:45] Speaker 1: Yep.

[01:52:50] Speaker 40: Ah, stable.

[01:52:51] Speaker 1: Stable? Okay.

[01:52:52] Speaker 40: Yeah.

[01:52:55] Speaker 1: Next up. Uh, the orc. Um, he isn't in a target rich environment and he is flanked, but he'll, uh, roll off. He's smart enough to move, um, out of it, so he can attack first. You're beating up more than two NPCs, but yeah, you can do it randomly. He doesn't like being flanked either, so one, he'll, takes a shot at her and it sweeps one of you guys. Um, that was missing horribly. And then he'll swing back to even... Yeah, he will go after you, so his second attack prevails.

[01:53:32] Speaker 13: Yay.

[01:53:32] Speaker 1: Um, does not like being in flank. He's just going to step back to there. That's it for him and he'll growl. Actually, yeah, he'll actually kind of move over.

[01:53:52] Speaker 13: All right, um, my turn. Um, Matthew's on deck. One action to move over 5, 10, 15, 20, so I can get flanking.

[01:54:04] Speaker 1: Okay.

[01:54:05] Speaker 13: Is that flanking or do I have to move there?

[01:54:07] Speaker 1: You'd have to be there, though if you move like that, he will get an attack opportunity himself.

[01:54:11] Speaker 13: Mm. I don't know that I would know that.

[01:54:14] Speaker 1: Yeah, you wouldn't know it until you triggered it.

[01:54:15] Speaker 13: Yeah. So.

[01:54:16] Speaker 1: Um, well, he'll take a swing at you, wouldn't he? (dice thudding) Uh, that would be a 19.

[01:54:25] Speaker 13: Yeah, that hits.

[01:54:26] Speaker 1: Um, 12.

[01:54:29] Speaker 13: Altogether?

[01:54:30] Speaker 1: 12 damage?

[01:54:31] Speaker 13: Yep.

[01:54:31] Speaker 1: I'm down. Oh.

[01:54:32] Speaker 43: Uh-oh.

[01:54:37] Speaker 1: Yeah, Doorkwill then look at you guys and laugh and, you know, "Ha ha ha, you guys' best ones are doomed."

[01:54:44] Speaker 13: Does my initiative move when I go down someone else's turn?

[01:54:46] Speaker 40: Yes. When you go down, your moved to right before the person that knocks you down.

[01:54:49] Speaker 13: Okay, which is why I moved. Yep.

[01:54:51] Speaker 1: Yeah, but like, it was their turn when they did that.

[01:54:54] Speaker 13: But it's, yeah.

[01:54:55] Speaker 1: Okay, Matthew you're up. Katie's next.

[01:54:57] Speaker 43: All righty. Uh, things are looking a little grim with, uh... Is it two of our people down or three?

[01:55:04] Speaker 1: Yeah, two.

[01:55:05] Speaker 43: Two.

[01:55:05] Speaker 40: Wow. Yeah.

[01:55:07] Speaker 45: All right. So I'm gonna start off by, uh, yelling, um, from, to... Knutfig, help!

[01:55:21] Speaker 18: If only I was conscious enough to hear, I would be curious.

[01:55:24] Speaker 45: (laughs) And, um, Katie, since you're conscious, you might briefly see a creature fly out from the woods. It's gonna fly over the enemies and then fly back into the trees. And it is going to apply, uh, a minus one penalty to the AC of the orc until the start of my next turn.

[01:55:51] Speaker 18: Oh. That's good.

[01:55:52] Speaker 45: Yep. And then I'm going to try to cast needle darts.

[01:55:56] Speaker 18: She's a witch!

[01:55:58] Speaker 46: (laughs)

[01:55:58] Speaker 45: On... What? No.

[01:56:00] Speaker 47: No. We don't know that. (laughs)

[01:56:00] Speaker 45: I'm a sorcerer. Stop that.

[01:56:02] Speaker 47: We don't know that.

[01:56:03] Speaker 48: (laughs)

[01:56:04] Speaker 18: She's a witch burn!

[01:56:06] Speaker 45: Uh, on the, uh, the orc. (dice thudding) Great. Uh, 22.

[01:56:12] Speaker 18: That hits.

[01:56:13] Speaker 45: (dice clattering) How's he looking by the way?

[01:56:16] Speaker 18: Um, we'll see after this one here.

[01:56:20] Speaker 45: Your eyes are closed. He's not looking at you.

[01:56:24] Speaker 18: (laughs)

[01:56:24] Speaker 49: My eyes couldn't be opened.

[01:56:26] Speaker 45: Uh, nine.

[01:56:26] Speaker 18: What's that?

[01:56:26] Speaker 45: Nine.

[01:56:26] Speaker 18: Nine's a lot of damage. Yeah. He is still up but he is looking kind of blood. He has a lot of stuff... Well, he had stuff so he... Yeah, that'll do him until it came back to you, so you got bloody. (imitates explosion)

[01:56:37] Speaker 45: All right. Uh, and that is my turn.

[01:56:41] Speaker 49: Katie, (sighs) you might have to move to see him 'cause he's kind of... Yeah, move to there you'll have a clean shot at him.

[01:56:56] Speaker 47: I did.

[01:56:58] Speaker 18: You have to reload.

[01:56:59] Speaker 45: I think she did. Last time she shot, she shot-

[01:57:02] Speaker 18: She reload.

[01:57:02] Speaker 45: Reloaded, shot, reload I thought.

[01:57:03] Speaker 18: Okay.

[01:57:04] Speaker 45: And she... And yeah, 'cause the turn before she ended shooting.

[01:57:06] Speaker 47: (exhales)

[01:57:08] Speaker 18: Crossbows are annoying.

[01:57:10] Speaker 47: Yeah, I'm realizing that.

[01:57:11] Speaker 45: (sighs) Yeah.

[01:57:13] Speaker 46: But if it fits the concept-

[01:57:15] Speaker 45: That's why I use needle darts. (laughs) It's like having a crossbow in many ways.

[01:57:19] Speaker 18: (laughs)

[01:57:19] Speaker 45: Except magic. (laughs)

[01:57:21] Speaker 18: Yeah. Though maybe it's kind of the same thing, like you have two actions before you make one attack. It's two actions-

[01:57:25] Speaker 45: Yeah.

[01:57:25] Speaker 18: ... for you to make one attack.

[01:57:26] Speaker 47: I take it it's an action to put away the crossbow and another action to draw your melee weapons?

[01:57:31] Speaker 45: Um, you can drop your crossbow for free.

[01:57:33] Speaker 18: It is now one action in Remastered to swap.

[01:57:36] Speaker 46: (laughs)

[01:57:37] Speaker 18: Okay.

[01:57:38] Speaker 45: Sweet.

[01:57:38] Speaker 18: 'Cause that was fucking annoying and they changed-

[01:57:40] Speaker 45: Yeah, you didn't have to do the free drop.

[01:57:42] Speaker 18: You used to have to drop and then draw but it is swap (laughs) is now one.

[01:57:47] Speaker 45: So yeah, you could swap and then you could... You didn't finish your other move.

[01:57:53] Speaker 18: You could have moved further. Yeah.

[01:57:54] Speaker 45: Yeah, you could have moved further. So-

[01:57:55] Speaker 47: Yeah, um. Maybe, uh-

[01:57:57] Speaker 45: I mean it's probably going to take you two moves to get to him. What's your movement speed?

[01:58:00] Speaker 47: 30.

[01:58:01] Speaker 45: And you, where were you before? Were you one, six?

[01:58:03] Speaker 18: Two back from there.

[01:58:04] Speaker 47: Uh-

[01:58:05] Speaker 18: You moved two to get there.

[01:58:06] Speaker 47: Yeah.

[01:58:06] Speaker 45: Two so-

[01:58:07] Speaker 47: Five, 10.

[01:58:08] Speaker 45: Move five... Let's see, five, 10, 15, 25, 30. You could get there in one move, so you could swap, get there-

[01:58:18] Speaker 47: And do one-

[01:58:19] Speaker 45: ... and then have one attack. Yeah.

[01:58:20] Speaker 47: Yeah, I'll do that.

[01:58:22] Speaker 45: Um, or actually you could get to there.

[01:58:24] Speaker 18: Yeah, on nine.

[01:58:25] Speaker 47: Yep.

[01:58:26] Speaker 45: I don't think you can get to the flank. So, wherever you want to be, you could be one of those three I'd say.

[01:58:31] Speaker 47: Uh, right in, uh, no, on... Next to him.

[01:58:38] Speaker 45: Right there?

[01:58:38] Speaker 47: Yep.

[01:58:39] Speaker 45: Okay.

[01:58:42] Speaker 47: Do NPCs give-

[01:58:44] Speaker 18: Yes, but there's-

[01:58:46] Speaker 45: Yeah, the other guy on the other side is an enemy.

[01:58:47] Speaker 18: (laughs) He's a bad guy, so no.

[01:58:49] Speaker 47: Um-

[01:58:50] Speaker 45: To get Flank you'd have to get to there and that's gonna be too much.

[01:58:53] Speaker 18: That's 35 to me.

[01:58:53] Speaker 45: Yeah.

[01:58:53] Speaker 18: Excuse me. Stop standing in my space.

[01:58:56] Speaker 45: It would work otherwise because-

[01:58:59] Speaker 47: Uh, I'm gonna-

[01:58:59] Speaker 45: ... he doesn't have any type of opportunity at the moment.

[01:59:01] Speaker 47: I'm gonna, oh well.

[01:59:02] Speaker 45: But...

[01:59:02] Speaker 47: I'm just go- I'm gonna attack. Do you pick one weapon to attack with or do you get both attacks, both weapon attacks?

[01:59:14] Speaker 45: You choose... When you swapped out, you could choose which weapon you wanted to re-arm with.

[01:59:17] Speaker 47: Mm. Okay.

[01:59:23] Speaker 45: He does have a negative one armor too so there's still a chance you can... Good roll.

[01:59:29] Speaker 47: Mm, 19.

[01:59:30] Speaker 45: That'll hit.

[01:59:32] Speaker 47: Okay. (die clattering)

[01:59:37] Speaker 18: That's good damage.

[01:59:38] Speaker 47: Five points damage.

[01:59:39] Speaker 18: Five, I think I hear strength too, or do you not have?

[01:59:44] Speaker 47: Uh, assign deadly in-

[01:59:48] Speaker 18: It's finesse, do you not have dexterity bonus? Doesn't it tell you what your, what your damage is on the character sheet?

[01:59:56] Speaker 47: 1d6.

[01:59:57] Speaker 18: 1d6 plus nothing?

[01:59:58] Speaker 47: Oh.
---

[01:59:59] Speaker 1: Sorry, it's in tiny print.

[02:00:00] Speaker 2: Oh. (laughs)

[02:00:08] Speaker 1: It just says 1d6.

[02:00:10] Speaker 2: Oh. What's your strength modifier? Is it-

[02:00:13] Speaker 3: Uh-

[02:00:13] Speaker 2: What do you have?

[02:00:14] Speaker 4: Or your dex?

[02:00:14] Speaker 1: Dex is plus three.

[02:00:16] Speaker 4: Should be plus three. This, she said it was a finesse weapon.

[02:00:19] Speaker 2: Oh, okay.

[02:00:20] Speaker 1: So eight points damage.

[02:00:21] Speaker 2: Okay, yep. Yeah, that's more than enough.

[02:00:23] Speaker 3: Yay.

[02:00:24] Speaker 4: Don't know why it doesn't say plus three.

[02:00:25] Speaker 1: I don't know why it doesn't say plus three either.

[02:00:27] Speaker 4: Is it a dagger or something?

[02:00:28] Speaker 1: No, it's a rapier. I think-

[02:00:29] Speaker 2: I thought, I thought they only added two, unless they changed things. Did they-

[02:00:32] Speaker 4: Oh, no. That is only a tack bonus. Sorry.

[02:00:33] Speaker 2: It's only a tack bonus, yeah. And if you, if you don't... Oh, it's that time. (game music plays)

[02:00:39] Speaker 4: There's two people. Three people? How many do we need? I have mine, so it's not me.

[02:00:42] Speaker 5: I have mine.

[02:00:43] Speaker 2: Uh, just me and Katie.

[02:00:46] Speaker 4: Uh, two of you.

[02:00:47] Speaker 1: 12.

[02:00:47] Speaker 5: 13.

[02:00:48] Speaker 2: Oh.

[02:00:49] Speaker 5: I'm gonna need this in a second.

[02:00:50] Speaker 3: (laughs)

[02:00:51] Speaker 4: Maybe. All you need to do is roll over 11.

[02:00:54] Speaker 5: Only one rolled an 11.

[02:00:55] Speaker 4: If you rolled an 11, you're stable. It's easier than 15.

[02:00:57] Speaker 2: So you hopped up there and you stabbed him right between the eyes.

[02:01:00] Speaker 1: Yep.

[02:01:01] Speaker 2: Um, let's see. That would've been three, so who's up next?

[02:01:04] Speaker 5: Gets six.

[02:01:05] Speaker 2: Get six. He sees you kill his boss. Um, he's probably not stupid enough to run away.

[02:01:11] Speaker 1: Safe.

[02:01:12] Speaker 2: Now, he's the big orc. He is the big man on campus.

[02:01:15] Speaker 4: He's two months old and he's in charge.

[02:01:17] Speaker 2: Yeah. He's just been promoted, field promotion. He attacks you with a 15.

[02:01:23] Speaker 1: That misses.

[02:01:24] Speaker 2: Yep. Um, he will triumphantly-

[02:01:28] Speaker 4: Go.

[02:01:29] Speaker 2: ... take a second attack as the general.

[02:01:30] Speaker 4: You got this. Keep going, buddy. You got it.

[02:01:32] Speaker 2: He miss. So while he's busy, uh-

[02:01:35] Speaker 4: Third attack, you got it. Oh, you had to step.

[02:01:37] Speaker 2: He had to step, so that's all he can do. Uh, next up.

[02:01:40] Speaker 5: Uh, that would be Irv, who I think is unconscious.

[02:01:43] Speaker 4: I was unconscious, or-

[02:01:43] Speaker 2: He's basically standing on top of you making the Napoleon pose.

[02:01:47] Speaker 6: (laughs)

[02:01:48] Speaker 1: Wow.

[02:01:48] Speaker 4: I'm undoing things until I become conscious again.

[02:01:51] Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.

[02:01:52] Speaker 5: Uh, next is me.

[02:01:52] Speaker 1: Did you make your save?

[02:01:54] Speaker 4: Yeah.

[02:01:54] Speaker 5: That is a six.

[02:01:56] Speaker 4: Two.

[02:01:56] Speaker 5: So I'm dying too.

[02:01:57] Speaker 4: Die two.

[02:01:59] Speaker 1: Yow.

[02:02:00] Speaker 5: And next is Matthew. Katie's on deck. Alrighty. Number six. Now, there is the wall in between you two, so you have to- The orc still around or did we finally kill him?

[02:02:12] Speaker 1: Oh, no. Now he's dead. I killed him.

[02:02:16] Speaker 2: Good.

[02:02:16] Speaker 5: All right then, I will move over here where I can see-

[02:02:22] Speaker 2: Yep, clear shot.

[02:02:23] Speaker 5: ... number six. And I will once again use my new favorite cantrip, needle arts.

[02:02:29] Speaker 2: Is this it? Is this how I go?

[02:02:31] Speaker 4: (laughs)

[02:02:33] Speaker 2: It's, has been a good life, I think.

[02:02:36] Speaker 5: Uh, 15.

[02:02:39] Speaker 2: I wouldn't... Uh, those guys? Actually, never looked at them. That would just, that would hit because of a certain little thing. No, it was the beginning or end of your next turn?

[02:02:48] Speaker 5: The minus one applied to the orc, not to the-

[02:02:51] Speaker 2: Oh, okay.

[02:02:52] Speaker 5: It's a single target situation.

[02:02:53] Speaker 2: Um, that wouldn't miss.

[02:02:55] Speaker 5: Okay.

[02:02:55] Speaker 2: It would have hit with that, though.

[02:02:58] Speaker 5: Oh, I didn't realize the Snotlings had a fif- had higher than 15 for their-

[02:03:03] Speaker 4: Yeah, I'm surprised.

[02:03:04] Speaker 2: Yeah.

[02:03:04] Speaker 5: AC. All right. Uh, well, that is my turn.

[02:03:07] Speaker 2: Katie. You could... Oh, the other guys are here. Um, we'll say they would've gone end of turn. Um, you're really stable. He's gonna... He's gonna walk around and at the very least stabilize you.

[02:03:24] Speaker 1: I'm gonna stab this-

[02:03:25] Speaker 4: Oh!

[02:03:25] Speaker 1: ... guy in front of me and use the flanking that the NPC just-

[02:03:29] Speaker 2: Yep.

[02:03:29] Speaker 1: ... gave me. Okay, thanks.

[02:03:32] Speaker 5: (sighs).

[02:03:38] Speaker 2: Yeah, I was forgetting. It's... You're right. It's, uh...

[02:03:44] Speaker 1: 14.

[02:03:45] Speaker 2: Uh, 14 with flank would hit.

[02:03:48] Speaker 1: Yeah, hit. (dice clattering) Uh, eight points death.

[02:04:01] Speaker 2: Eight points? That's enough.

[02:04:02] Speaker 1: And I will stab him through the throat. (dice clattering)

[02:04:11] Speaker 2: He dies saying something in Goblin to the effect of, "I'll be back." Um, but, uh-

[02:04:16] Speaker 5: "I'll be back."

[02:04:19] Speaker 6: Ouch.

[02:04:19] Speaker 2: "Viva la revolucion," he says, um, in his Napoleonic, and they're all dead.

[02:04:24] Speaker 4: It's, it's Thief that lets you add your dexterity. The Thief racket lets you-

[02:04:30] Speaker 2: Oh.

[02:04:31] Speaker 4: ... add your dexterity to your damage bonus instead of strength. But you're not Thief.

[02:04:35] Speaker 1: And I don't have a strength bonus. My strength is plus zero.

[02:04:38] Speaker 2: Ah.

[02:04:39] Speaker 1: So that explains why. Okay, this makes sense.

[02:04:42] Speaker 2: So they're all done. Um, there's enough people that this, you know, skirmish didn't take too long as f- time-wise, so... By the time everyone else gets out of their tents and comes over, they see you guys. There are some healers in the party, they'll get you guys that are down, up, bring you back by the fire when you can-

[02:04:58] Speaker 4: Once you're unconscious, you kind of wake up on your own after 10 minutes or so.

[02:05:01] Speaker 2: Yeah. But you guys need a full night's sleep in. They're, you know, appreciative that you guys took care of them.

[02:05:08] Speaker 4: Did they... Was there somebody who actually treated wounds for hit points or-

[02:05:12] Speaker 2: Yeah, they'll... There are enough people in the caravan, mercenaries and whatnot, that do that. Though if one of you guys has healing and wants to, uh, med someone who wants to-

[02:05:21] Speaker 4: All I have is, uh, I do have medicine for the old-fashioned crappy treat wounds.

[02:05:25] Speaker 2: I did not have enough gold to buy a healer's kit, so-

[02:05:28] Speaker 4: I did. (laughs) That's why I didn't buy everything in the original-

[02:05:32] Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.

[02:05:32] Speaker 4: ... like, cla- class kit.

[02:05:35] Speaker 5: Oh, just like one or two gold short I think.

[02:05:37] Speaker 4: Yeah.

[02:05:37] Speaker 5: Those kits are expensive.

[02:05:39] Speaker 4: Yes, they are.

[02:05:39] Speaker 2: Yeah. So you guys get a good night's rest in. Um-

[02:05:43] Speaker 5: So we're just at full health? Full b-

[02:05:44] Speaker 2: Yeah, you get, you get a rest. They'll heal you up. You guys are-

[02:05:46] Speaker 4: Do the, do the whatever. Re- rest and prepare to get your daily crap back.

[02:05:50] Speaker 2: Yeah.

[02:05:51] Speaker 5: Get all that experience.

[02:05:51] Speaker 4: Also makes wounded one go away. If you added that.

[02:05:56] Speaker 5: I did.

[02:05:57] Speaker 2: So, you guys rest up for the night.Camp ha-... The caravan packs up the next morning and starts to head out. You travel for another, you know, day or two, nice long days. I mean, it might be... It could be considered fun with the exception at any moment, you could be attacked and horribly stomped. A few times you'll see or hear the ground shake and even in wagons. And you'll see trees in the distance starts, starts to swaying, um, because yeah, there are giants and there are mammoths and there are any host of number of things that would happily stomp at you. Um, with a call-

[02:06:30] Speaker 7: You do know that at some point (laughs) I get the ability to trip things two sizes larger than me?

[02:06:35] Speaker 8: (laughs)

[02:06:36] Speaker 2: (laughs)

[02:06:36] Speaker 7: Hmm, perhaps-

[02:06:37] Speaker 2: Mammoth?

[02:06:37] Speaker 7: ... a mammoth? (laughs)

[02:06:40] Speaker 9: Yeah, maybe.

[02:06:40] Speaker 7: A throwback to an old campaign. (laughs)

[02:06:43] Speaker 2: My character's crowning achievement.

[02:06:45] Speaker 7: In the final battle-

[02:06:46] Speaker 9: You tripped him-

[02:06:46] Speaker 7: ... with the final boss, he tripped a mammoth.

[02:06:49] Speaker 9: (laughs)

[02:06:49] Speaker 2: And the boss was riding the mammoth, so the boss fell off.

[02:06:52] Speaker 7: It was very epic. (laughs)

[02:06:54] Speaker 2: Well, I had to spend everything to do it, but-

[02:06:56] Speaker 7: Yes.

[02:06:56] Speaker 2: This is in Pathfinder one where it's not as-

[02:06:59] Speaker 7: This is one, one E where, like, combat maneuvers were even harder.

[02:07:01] Speaker 2: Yeah.

[02:07:01] Speaker 7: What was that? I don't even remember. There was, like, a separate defense for combat-

[02:07:05] Speaker 2: Yeah.

[02:07:05] Speaker 7: ... maneuver defense.

[02:07:06] Speaker 2: I just spent a ton of feats to even get my insane bonus to do that. But anyway, um, so while you guys, you know, travel, um, it's... But beyond that it's very primeval type forest. This is dense. You... Beyond the road that's been cut through here, you can tell almost none of nature's been really touched, um, beyond any of the monsters or other stuff that comes running through.

[02:07:26] Speaker 8: Oh, we didn't say it, but I assume I would have picked up my javelin before we left camp.

[02:07:31] Speaker 2: Oh, yeah. You guys are able to-

[02:07:31] Speaker 9: Uh, yeah.

[02:07:32] Speaker 2: ... pick up whatever you needed to. Um, so you, um, here. You guys, uh, travel on. Um, after the second day you guys stop and we'll, um... Again, not much time to talk. It was some kinda tense nights. No one's really talking. You don't really get much of an opportunity because you're so focused on that. But you guys get your first chance to get everyone around, is next time you stop at another caravan safari. And you guys, um... It's a little... This one's a little bit more... It's fairly secure, um, and some of the guards are manning all the different outposts. Better doors. And you guys get your first, what we'll call, campfire, um, moment or... And what we do in these throughout the campaign, you get campfires. So basically what it is, is I'll send you guys... As much as we're doing it, I'm trying not to do things... There is gonna be a lot of, like, role placing, like, "What do you wanna do today?" "Well, I'll go talk to this guy or I'll do this or that." Um, since there's gonna be five people, I'm not always gonna have time to go to every one person one at a time, go through what everyone wants to do.

[02:08:27] Speaker 9: Yeah.

[02:08:27] Speaker 2: Um, since there's gonna be five people, I'm not always gonna have time to go to every one person one at a time, go through what everyone wants to do. So I may jot down what you wanna do and then I may email you or in Discord you, probably in PDF form, um, unless you guys prefer Word. Um, a little recap of your conversation. Now, out of... During the week, obviously I don't want you guys to feel like you have to do role playing stuff, you know, when you're not in session. But you can always read it if you want to. But when you come back, um, the main reason I'm sending this stuff is so that you can kind of present to the party as you want to. Like, I always hated during organized play, you know, you roll a dice and the GM says, "Okay, this is what you know," and they tell the entire party. Well, this is what you know. I'd like you to be able, the ability to have to tell, to tell the party. Now, you don't have to, but the intent is that you will find a way to in your own way to communicate that to the party. Um, so this is where you guys can talk, you know, you guys can chat. I'll give you guys a few moments if you want to, you know, read through your notes. I'll try again, I'll try to send them. I'll try to put a date in there so you can kinda go back and, you know, look through. I don't want there to be a ton of stuff, but the intent is, is that you can share your own stuff with the party in a way you would phrase it. It'll give you a little bit more buy-in as opposed to just, you know, I tell you what happened and then the party just hears it and then you just say, "Well, I tell the party what I heard." And that's not really my favorite role play, so. Hopefully there'll be a little bit more buy-in that way too, since you can present it in your own way. So you guys have a campfire moment where you're all sitting around a campfire, you're a little more free. There are, um...

[02:09:49] Speaker 7: When I had been... Kotal has been doing this each night and even when it was tense. He always, before he goes to bed, he finds some time by the campfire to quietly, you know, play a quiet song on his lute. So when this campfire starts, he will have already been sitting there tuning his lute and playing some song, mostly just for himself.

[02:10:10] Speaker 2: Um, Lin will come over. Um, he says, "That is quite lovely, my friend," he says. "Here, here." And he has some tea. He makes some tea by the fire, um, fine, um, flower tea from obviously the, uh, Jade Kingdoms. And, um, if you don't mind, maybe he'll kind of start humming and singing, you know, along to the tune if he can pick it up.

[02:10:32] Speaker 7: Yeah.

[02:10:32] Speaker 2: And then, you know, that kind of... Speaking in the-

[02:10:34] Speaker 7: All of the songs that Kotal sings are-

[02:10:39] Speaker 2: Like all-

[02:10:40] Speaker 7: ... songs with a plot. They're, they're like some, like, ly- lyrical story about, uh, you know, the miller who was a werewolf and because of the full moon and or the, you know, the courting of the maiden by the town, you know, whatever. So they're all, they're all plot-

[02:11:01] Speaker 2: Yeah.

[02:11:01] Speaker 7: There's all, a reason to listen, it's not just music.

[02:11:03] Speaker 2: Well, if you want to, you can always chat GPT a quick tune and we can, we can do that too.

[02:11:08] Speaker 8: (laughs)

[02:11:08] Speaker 2: That's one of the kinda clever things you can do. And it's perfectly fits if you ever want to. So yeah, you're, you, you start doing that thing. Lin usually comes over, he's listening and maybe-

[02:11:16] Speaker 7: I mean, I-

[02:11:17] Speaker 2: ... humming in the background.

[02:11:18] Speaker 7: Kotal is not a virtuoso. Like, if you've heard good musicians, Kotal is just okay.

[02:11:27] Speaker 10: Arnor will join you and from inside his cloak, he'll pull out a small flute and start playing along.

[02:11:35] Speaker 7: More the merrier.

[02:11:37] Speaker 10: He's also not-

[02:11:38] Speaker 7: Al- also because he's not, like, a virtuoso, the songs aren't, like, complex chord patterns.

[02:11:44] Speaker 8: (laughs)

[02:11:45] Speaker 7: They're very easy to join into-

[02:11:46] Speaker 2: It's pop chords. (laughs)

[02:11:48] Speaker 7: One, four, five, four, one. (laughs)

[02:11:50] Speaker 10: Yeah, and Arnor is not particularly great either, but, uh-

[02:11:53] Speaker 7: No. It's-

[02:11:55] Speaker 10: He joins in.

[02:11:59] Speaker 9: Yeah, I think Broldan would be around the campfire at some point to enjoy the songs and listen and maybe talk-

[02:12:06] Speaker 7: It's just a way for, it's a way for... He'll so- after a song is over, he'll say, "Thank you, my friends. I like to play to relax. Hopefully it provides some relaxation to others as well."

[02:12:21] Speaker 2: Um, Sylvia at some point has come over as well to join you guys at the campfire. You guys were there when Lynn's there. All right, there you are.

[02:12:32] Speaker 11: Oh.

[02:12:32] Speaker 2: There's you guys around the campfire. And she'll come and do um, you know, "You guys had fought well. So have you. I, um, had heard the prowess of, of the Duergar. I had, had never seen you in action, however."

[02:12:49] Speaker 12: Yes, it's, it's always fun to serve Grummel in my own way.

[02:12:56] Speaker 13: Grummel? Is that his name?

[02:12:57] Speaker 12: I can't remember the name off the top of my head.

[02:13:02] Speaker 13: Ah.

[02:13:04] Speaker 12: It's another slayer god.

[02:13:05] Speaker 13: Yeah. Something with a G. Uh, it's always good to serve Grummel and fight to the best of my ability.

[02:13:14] Speaker 2: And she'd say, "Have you... Your, your kind is well known. Um, we would have slayer cults come through our area when I was kid and they, they, uh, they killed some, uh, trolls." And she tells both of you a little story.

[02:13:30] Speaker 13: From here.

[02:13:31] Speaker 2: Oh, yep, that's right. Um, she says, "Yeah, they had killed some trolls, um, when I was a kid, so I've, uh, admittedly there's always been a great fascination among some of my cousins with, uh, slayer types."

[02:13:44] Speaker 13: Mm. "Yes, I once killed a troll myself. One of my arms was tied behind my back, but I had my hand in a beard and I wrapped it around its neck and strangled it as much as I could." (sighs) "My friends call me A Vicious Beard indeed."

[02:14:02] Speaker 2: (laughs) Well, she would, um, that could be your character's, you know, um, story, or of a vicious beer, perhaps.

[02:14:14] Speaker 13: Oh, please, my friends call me Broc.

[02:14:17] Speaker 2: Oh, that's right, obviously.

[02:14:18] Speaker 12: (laughs)

[02:14:18] Speaker 2: Um, I'm gonna... It's gonna go well for one of guys' characters named Tooby for myself, so, I'll probably get it wrong. Um, but yeah, you know, she kind of chitchats with some of you guys about that. Um, and if you guys would... No, you're good. Um, yeah, and all, the rest of you guys are free to talk. You guys haven't really introduced each other's names, so... Um, but she would introduce herself as Sylvia. Um, last name is Mournhold. Wouldn't probably mean anything to any of you guys, but... Um, he says, "I'm Lynn, Lynn Chong. Um, from..." He goes through a specific, uh, area that he's from in the Jade Kingdoms. You guys can-

[02:14:57] Speaker 14: Oh, Aurelia.

[02:14:58] Speaker 12: What was that?

[02:15:00] Speaker 14: Aurelia.

[02:15:01] Speaker 12: Aurelia. Okay.

[02:15:03] Speaker 2: You know, they'd say, "Well met." Uh, you've come from over the mountains. They, they will, they will... I think both of them would recognize you, um, as, uh... Um, Grails are, are well enough known, um, to both of the NPCs at least. Yeah.

[02:15:25] Speaker 13: You already know me. I've introduced myself. Uh, Ralden Grimstone. But my friends, and I do count you among my friends now, they call me Broc.

[02:15:36] Speaker 2: Oh, and they say, "Well met." Um, "And you our quiet friend?"

[02:15:41] Speaker 7: Uh-huh. I am called Kotal. I was, uh, born where the air tastes of copper and orchids in a monastery that teaches pupils to hear, you would call, or Gaia, to hear Gaia's every sigh. I, uh, there I swept courtyards and sparred with the reeves, and learned this, that a single true breath can steady both heart and hand. When my questions outnumbered the answers I was receiving, the elders pressed this staff into my palm and told me to walk until I understood why w- wind must wander.

[02:16:25] Speaker 2: Um, Lynn seems particularly receptive to that. And she says, "Ah, that is, um, very eloquently put. You speak with such a, a poetic tongue. I have, um, seen very few of your, your kind, and many of my people even less, but hopefully we shall learn more of you."

[02:16:44] Speaker 7: Perhaps we will travel together longer.

[02:16:48] Speaker 2: Yes, we are all luckily headed to, uh, Tigran's Crossing, so, um, maybe fortuitous for us to have met here. Just, like, one seat that's, you know... 'Cause yes, like, you see the, the, the several characters on a computer game and one character's missing that you know you're gonna meet someday, so... Sitting around the campfire, there's a conspicuously empty camp seat, but...

[02:17:11] Speaker 12: (laughs) What is the shape of the seat?

[02:17:14] Speaker 2: (laughs)

[02:17:14] Speaker 14: (laughs) Uh, I would've probably, like, pu- pulled out, you know, like, the origami paper. She would've probably, like, pulled out a stack of origami paper and just, like, started making, like, origami birds, origami, like, snakes, just, like, little animals. Just sitting there, breath fire.

[02:17:39] Speaker 2: Um, yeah, they would probably... I mean, these, these two NPCs would probably be pretty interested in that, um, your skill or how you got it. Just a hobby or pastime.

[02:17:48] Speaker 14: Yeah.

[02:17:50] Speaker 2: Yeah, I think that's quite interesting. And, yeah, you probably don't see a lot of people that can do that.

[02:17:55] Speaker 14: Yeah.

[02:17:59] Speaker 2: And then last but not least, they might look at you and say, "Well, our Norn friend."

[02:18:05] Speaker 15: Uh, our Norn, if he, if we're no longer playing, uh, music at this point, would actually be knitting.

[02:18:12] Speaker 2: Oh, that is quite-

[02:18:13] Speaker 14: What are you making?

[02:18:14] Speaker 15: A scarf. He's just knitting the net. Ah, yes.

[02:18:25] Speaker 16: I'm Arnor Josefsson (laughs) of Solstheim. Looking for my fortune, wandering the world. Looking for, forward to seeing Tegrim's Crossing at this point in my life.

[02:18:42] Speaker 2: Ah, well. It is perhaps fortuitous that we would have both a Norn and, um-

[02:18:49] Speaker 17: Durgar.

[02:18:50] Speaker 2: ... a Durgar, um, joining us here. Um, as well as another from over the mountain, um, and then one from across the sea.

[02:18:58] Speaker 16: "Fate can be a interesting thing," I say as I continue knitting. (laughs)

[02:19:06] Speaker 13: My Norn friend, I hold no grudges against the Norn raids. I hope you hold none against the Durgar.

[02:19:11] Speaker 16: "Never found a reason to hold grudges. Fate weaves as it wills."

[02:19:21] Speaker 2: So, you guys have a chance to sit there and chit chat with each other for a while, if there's anything you wanna, you know... Outside of that, the night will just pass along. Um, and you can sit there and play music and whatnot, it's always a welcome thing. Um, you know, in older times, yeah, people who could play an instrument, even if you weren't good at it, it was still highly appreciated 'cause generally speaking, you may only hear music once every few days, perhaps.

[02:19:45] Speaker 7: I have found in my travels that oftentimes the offer to play a bit of music in the tavern common room will pay for my meal and my room in small tavern, which as you say, has not been, has not heard music in sometime.

[02:20:03] Speaker 16: Skalds are always appreciated in Solstheim.

[02:20:10] Speaker 2: So appreciative of your language as skalds

[02:20:11] Speaker 18: (laughs)

[02:20:11] Speaker 2: ... come among. Um, so yeah. I mean, if you guys have anything you wanna say or whatnot, otherwise we're gonna pass the night.

[02:20:22] Speaker 7: Meaning, Kotal is, Kotal's personality appears to be the person who doesn't start conversations, so he would mostly stay. Listen carefully to what people are saying, but he will not... He's not a extrovert, as you might, as one might say. So-

[02:20:47] Speaker 19: I was kind of thinking the same.

[02:20:49] Speaker 7: But he would, uh, he would note that he has more information to share if only someone would ask, yeah (laughs)

[02:20:58] Speaker 16: (laughs) Arnor is quite e- extroverted.

[02:21:00] Speaker 2: Mm.

[02:21:01] Speaker 16: Well-

[02:21:02] Speaker 7: Perhaps Arnor would say, "What? So why the hell are you going to Tegrim's Crossing?" (laughs)

[02:21:07] Speaker 19: He really is kind of shy, but like, if people start talking to her, she'll, like, engage in conversation, but yeah, she doesn't really like to start-

[02:21:16] Speaker 7: Arnor.

[02:21:16] Speaker 19: ... conversations.

[02:21:17] Speaker 7: "Why are you going to Tegrim's Crossing?" (laughs)

[02:21:20] Speaker 16: Ah, wandering the world.

[02:21:23] Speaker 7: Ah.

[02:21:23] Speaker 16: Looking forward to seeing it. Seeing what business I can find there.

[02:21:30] Speaker 7: The wanderlust took you?

[02:21:32] Speaker 16: It affects many of us at some point in our lives.

[02:21:35] Speaker 7: Indeed.

[02:21:36] Speaker 16: Me a bit later than some, but hey.

[02:21:38] Speaker 7: I am 250 years old, but we still-

[02:21:41] Speaker 16: (laughs)

[02:21:41] Speaker 7: ... are very sprightly in our youths, aren't we?

[02:21:44] Speaker 16: Aye. Aye. So, my friends, we fought together in arms against the orc and the goblins. What did we do well? What can we improve next time?

[02:22:00] Speaker 13: Like to not miss my attacks.

[02:22:02] Speaker 16: (laughs)

[02:22:03] Speaker 17: (laughs)

[02:22:04] Speaker 19: Don't fall down.

[02:22:05] Speaker 13: Yes, that too.

[02:22:08] Speaker 7: Must be less rash.

[02:22:16] Speaker 19: Why are you going into-

[02:22:17] Speaker 7: More balance.

[02:22:18] Speaker 19: ... Tegrim's Crossing.

[02:22:19] Speaker 2: Mm.

[02:22:20] Speaker 13: Oh, the thrill of battle, adventure. I am a dwarven slayer. We seek battle that's a good depth-

[02:22:28] Speaker 17: (laughs)

[02:22:28] Speaker 13: ... to the end of our journeys. I hear there is much battle there. I look forward to fighting and someday dying in that battle.

[02:22:38] Speaker 16: A good death.

[02:22:39] Speaker 13: Indeed.

[02:22:40] Speaker 16: Worthy of, uh...

[02:22:44] Speaker 13: Durnir?

[02:22:45] Speaker 16: Yeah. I don't remember what we were calling it.

[02:22:52] Speaker 2: What about you? (laughs)

[02:22:55] Speaker 17: (laughs)

[02:22:56] Speaker 16: (laughs)

[02:22:57] Speaker 13: What are you doing at Tegrim's Crossing?

[02:23:00] Speaker 19: Uh, investigating.

[02:23:04] Speaker 16: Investigating?

[02:23:05] Speaker 19: Mm-hmm.

[02:23:06] Speaker 16: An investigator, are you?

[02:23:08] Speaker 19: Mm-hmm.

[02:23:10] Speaker 16: Mm. It's a noble profession.

[02:23:12] Speaker 19: Looking into something for a friend.

[02:23:17] Speaker 13: Well, perhaps if we continue journeying together, we may be able to uncover that. I'd be happy to assist you. (laughs)

[02:23:25] Speaker 19: Possibly.

[02:23:30] Speaker 16: And our scaly friend.

[02:23:32] Speaker 2: (laughs)

[02:23:32] Speaker 17: (laughs)

[02:23:32] Speaker 7: (laughs)

[02:23:32] Speaker 13: (laughs)

[02:23:32] Speaker 16: (laughs)

[02:23:36] Speaker 2: You know, he was always preparing it.

[02:23:37] Speaker 16: What is it that you are seeking in Tegrim's Crossing?

[02:23:39] Speaker 7: I have an answer.

[02:23:42] Speaker 2: (laughs)

[02:23:44] Speaker 7: A moss, a moss-eaten carving of a warrior clutching a broken blade lodged itself in my thoughts and has not been willing to let go. I am following its scattered echoes and I believe that the whispers hint that the broken sword's, uh, story ends somewhere beyond these hills. Whether it ends in ash or in blossom, I intend to see it firsthand.

[02:24:11] Speaker 16: Fascinating. Hm.

[02:24:14] Speaker 19: (laughs)

[02:24:16] Speaker 13: Is this a vision you had or an artifact you've stumbled across that's led you on this quest?

[02:24:21] Speaker 7: It was an ancient rune in my homeland. Of a dwarven warrior with a broken we- we- we- weapon. And some cryptic runes, which led me here.

[02:24:41] Speaker 20: I think, uh, Roldan gets a little quiet at that.

[02:24:51] Speaker 2: I'll have to now, see if I can find you a photo of the shit I'd seen. Um, yeah, I mean, and the rest are kind of interested. Um, he will, um... (clears throat) As far as like the NPCs, uh, Lin eventually says to us, "Well, I am very pleased to be in the, uh, p- party of such, uh, uh, companions. Uh, I am seeking, uh, Tigran's Crossing. Um, the, uh, Jade Kingdoms had helped build the road up until Tigran's Crossing and, uh, there were rumors of, um... They had been taking, uh..." Some of the different kingdoms have been out here, uh, for a while, taking little expeditions. The rumors fly that there is this, uh, shrine of, uh, um, great healing and, uh, divine power, um. Has to be a very oriental one, but y- you know, shrine, but... "Um, so I wish to go out and maybe, uh, see the land for myself, um, and set up... I am older in age, not really so much to adventure, but, um, I heard when Tigran's Crossing was built, there were... So my kind had been here and had set up an old, uh, shrine." This, uh, the shrine in this case would have been a very, uh, um, oriental, um, Buddhist type shrine, but... "Um, have any of you guys ever been to a Buddhist monastery?"

[02:26:13] Speaker 21: Yes.

[02:26:13] Speaker 2: Yeah. You get kind of, you'll get kind of the feel for what he's referring to when he talks about these kinds of places. "I've heard it has long been abandoned and disrepair, so, um, I'd perhaps get, fix this up myself." Sylvia will just kind of roll her eyes. Um, as far as she's sitting, she's sitting, you know, um, very, you know, like, uh, you assume like a noble would sit, very straight, incredibly good posture and whatnot. Uh, she just comments, um, "I'm just here on family business. Um, my, uh, eh, our family has, uh, ties, um, d- an interest in improving our trade. So I'm going to each crossing to see to that." Um, she s- sighs, and you guys kind of tell there's a little bit of unease. And she says, "Well, I should say, I was voluntold, uh, to go here and-"

[02:27:15] Speaker 22: Family drama.

[02:27:16] Speaker 2: "... see to our..." She says, "We are more or less, I'm not the eldest. My older brothers and sisters will inherit the family fortune. Um, it is my duty to, um, see to the family's duties, uh, perhaps our future, um, in these lands." So to Tigran's Crossing I go. (dramatic music) And with that, the night just continues with some general chit-chatting and, and whatnot. Um, you guys take off the next morning, um, the cold caravan lurches. You know you're still a good decent ways away at this point still. Getting from where you're going and crossing, you know, from the dwarven place to Tigran's Crossing, that's still gonna, it's like several weeks. These roads are nice. They're dwarven built roads, but still, um, it's a bumpy, fairly slow ride. You can't just charge your horses all the time. Um, you make your way, um, throughout the next few days. Um, and really it's uneventful, uh, not that it's peaceful. I mean, it's nothing in this world really is, but, um, you make your way a bit further. Um, you're on the road the next day, and all of a sudden you're in the caravan in your carts, and you hear some shouting coming, um, from down the line. And all of a sudden you notice that the caravan is picking up speed.

[02:28:43] Speaker 20: From ahead?

[02:28:44] Speaker 2: Yep. And then word gets passed along, kind of telephone style. Um, a lot of it's-

[02:28:51] Speaker 22: Hear it in the night time.

[02:28:51] Speaker 2: ... not accurate, you know, peop- purple monkey eating grapes. Um, you know what that means, but eventually you figure out that they're under attack. Um, and I'll let you go ahead and roll initiative while I get this set up.

[02:29:04] Speaker 20: Ancestors.

[02:29:10] Speaker 22: I'm not sneaking.

[02:29:15] Speaker 2: Yeah, you'd probably be able to in the carts 'cause you're riding in carts this time.

[02:29:19] Speaker 22: My perception is actually better than my stealth, so.

[02:29:23] Speaker 2: Yeah, later on once you start... I think rogues have a good perception. I think once you start taking like, if you specialize in stealth, then it becomes worth doing a little bit more. Arnor.

[02:29:44] Speaker 21: 24.

[02:29:47] Speaker 20: Hey. Trying to remember people's names as I do this. Arilla.

[02:29:54] Speaker 2: Aurelia.

[02:29:55] Speaker 22: Uh, 11.

[02:29:56] Speaker 20: 11.

[02:29:58] Speaker 2: Kotar.

[02:30:00] Speaker 23: Seven.

[02:30:01] Speaker 2: Now which cart do you guys wanna be in? I'll give you guys... There's basically two. You can spread yourselves out however you wish, and the NPCs will follow up with whatever...

[02:30:09] Speaker 20: Front cart for Kotal.

[02:30:15] Speaker 2: Aurelia?

[02:30:17] Speaker 22: Mm-hmm.

[02:30:18] Speaker 2: Aurelia, which cart did you wanna be in?

[02:30:22] Speaker 22: Hmm, the back one.

[02:30:23] Speaker 2: Back one.

[02:30:25] Speaker 22: To A, keep watch behind us, and B...

[02:30:29] Speaker 2: Okay, your guy.

[02:30:30] Speaker 21: Uh, I guess the front one.

[02:30:31] Speaker 2: Front one.

[02:30:33] Speaker 21: Well, so that we're split up two and two, I guess I'll take the back one.

[02:30:36] Speaker 2: Okay, and then the two NPCs will join you in the back. Yeah.

[02:30:39] Speaker 20: Seems more, more room back there.

[02:30:41] Speaker 2: Yeah, bigger cart just by...I gotta go through and print up a few more. Just, I mean it's, obviously caravans are gonna be playing a part in this campaign, so we need more wagons. Kent has one I painted up for him. Hold on.

[02:30:55] Speaker 24: Let's just say I'm sure you have more wagons, right?

[02:30:58] Speaker 2: Not now, but-

[02:30:59] Speaker 24: Oh.

[02:30:59] Speaker 2: ... they will.

[02:31:00] Speaker 25: But he's got a miniature factory over there.

[02:31:03] Speaker 24: Yeah, it's true. He does.

[02:31:05] Speaker 2: So yeah, print two of those, but I gotta, uh, adjust the STLs 'cause they

[02:31:08] Speaker 26: Yeah.

[02:31:08] Speaker 2: ... different. So it's not too long, and all of a sudden you guys start hearing yelping. And you realize this is goblins.

[02:31:15] Speaker 24: Wow. We out-piled them to the back here, didn't we?

[02:31:18] Speaker 27: No.

[02:31:18] Speaker 24: No.

[02:31:19] Speaker 28: There's two species out there.

[02:31:20] Speaker 24: Uh-

[02:31:20] Speaker 27: Two species? Oh.

[02:31:20] Speaker 2: Yeah. It's probably good 'cause the fighters are in the front, but... Now bear in mind, there's a series of carts in front of you also.

[02:31:28] Speaker 24: Where are we in? Like, where are our carts in the line?

[02:31:32] Speaker 2: You are at the back of the line.

[02:31:33] Speaker 24: We're the caboose. Got it.

[02:31:34] Speaker 2: Yep. You guys are prote- protecting the rear.

[02:31:37] Speaker 28: We were hired super defend the back.

[02:31:39] Speaker 24: Awesome.

[02:31:42] Speaker 2: And it doesn't take long before wagon goes through. Uh, they, uh, the wagons start picking up speed. And you start passing, and goblins start-

[02:31:50] Speaker 25: Trying to outrun them?

[02:31:52] Speaker 28: Popping out.

[02:31:52] Speaker 25: Is that what our assumption is?

[02:31:54] Speaker 2: Trying to move through fast.

[02:31:55] Speaker 25: Yeah.

[02:31:55] Speaker 2: 'Cause these are coming on the ground.

[02:31:57] Speaker 25: Yeah, getting out of the... Oh, this was an ambushy type scenario.

[02:31:59] Speaker 24: Uh-oh.

[02:31:59] Speaker 28: Are these gits or do they look a little more-

[02:32:01] Speaker 2: They're goblins. They're a little bit older. They're probably full goblins at this point. Um, so you guys are coming through, and they're starting to... Again, they're kinda lined up here. This is just for showing purposes, like, yeah, there's a little-

[02:32:17] Speaker 28: Is Qotalr with a Q or a K?

[02:32:20] Speaker 25: Q-O-T-A-L, Qotalr.

[02:32:22] Speaker 28: Qotalr. Okay.

[02:32:25] Speaker 2: Yeah. Yeah.

[02:32:26] Speaker 28: I got the Q right, though.

[02:32:27] Speaker 2: Okay. Okay. So you can just go into initiative here. Basically have a ton of guys attacking. Now you can do attacks if you want to. You guys are passing through these guys kinda quick, so you can do things to... This is more like, we'll do a few rounds here where you can take and choose to do something. You can attack with a ma- with, uh... They're gonna be hard. Unless you have, really have reach, you're probably gonna have a hard time meleeing them. And if you think if you fall off a cart or jump off a cart, probably not gonna be-

[02:32:55] Speaker 28: We're gonna be left behind.

[02:32:56] Speaker 2: You're gonna, yeah, you might be rolling a new character for next week. So-

[02:32:58] Speaker 28: (laughs)

[02:32:58] Speaker 2: ... probably don't wanna do that. Um, but these have picked up. They're moving pretty fast, so again, it's a negative one for them to hit you, but same thing for you guys shooting back. So you can take range attacks. If you have other things you can do that you can think of to... Basically it's a full round action, three actions. Do things to persuade, you know, um, make it harder for them to hit you. You know, if you wanna do a skill or something like that, be creative, something.

[02:33:25] Speaker 24: Okay.

[02:33:26] Speaker 2: So we'll do a few rounds here. Be kinda like skill checky type rounds. Things you're doing while you're-

[02:33:31] Speaker 24: Mm-hmm.

[02:33:31] Speaker 2: ... in here. You could be trying to repair the carts. Remember, your guy's wagon had taken a little bit of damage before. You could use crafting. You could-

[02:33:38] Speaker 24: Do I get penalties for traveling in the sun? Is that a thing in...

[02:33:43] Speaker 2: Uh, no not in this one, 'cause, um, one of the things, one of the reasons dhampir actually go outside is vampires would, yes, but dhampir are not bothered by the sun.

[02:33:52] Speaker 24: Ah-ha. Except for me. Okay.

[02:33:56] Speaker 2: Probably don't l- love it, but I mean, it's, I mean, you're probably not gonna go sunbathing. Most dhampir wouldn't do that.

[02:34:01] Speaker 24: No power.

[02:34:01] Speaker 25: No mechanical penalties.

[02:34:02] Speaker 2: Yeah, there's no mechanical penalties. Uh, lore-wise, um, the sun radiates positive energy, and that's how things grow and bloom.

[02:34:12] Speaker 24: Yay.

[02:34:12] Speaker 2: Um, where you're kinda bothered by positive energy. Um, but when things die their positive energy goes away and it, it morphs into negative energy, um, which is why, um... Like again, you're half living and half undead, so... So who's first up on initiative?

[02:34:30] Speaker 24: You guys don't know that yet, though.

[02:34:32] Speaker 28: Um, do the goblins have-

[02:34:33] Speaker 2: Depends if you haven't shown him. Yeah, right now you've only... You could've emphasized your things or not.

[02:34:39] Speaker 28: Yeah.

[02:34:39] Speaker 24: Okay. I've been trying to, yeah.

[02:34:40] Speaker 28: It's called multi-tasking, right?

[02:34:40] Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. As far as you guys know, I'll point out, lore-wise she's just a greathyl. You don't know she's a dhampir, because she doesn't show you-

[02:34:46] Speaker 24: You guys don't know that I'm a dhampir yet.

[02:34:48] Speaker 28: Do the goblins get initiative, or?

[02:34:50] Speaker 2: No, they're just gonna be doing things at the, in between rounds.

[02:34:53] Speaker 28: Okay. Uh, well, first would be Arnor, the 24.

[02:34:56] Speaker 29: Okay. Uh, then I will start by... Don't suppose... Yeah, I can't see you or you.

[02:35:06] Speaker 2: If you're in the cart in front you could s- technically see them.

[02:35:09] Speaker 29: Great. Good enough. Uh, then I'll cast nudge fate on you again.

[02:35:12] Speaker 28: Uh-huh.

[02:35:14] Speaker 29: Um, and then I'm gonna needle darts at one of the...

[02:35:21] Speaker 2: Oh, yep. You can unleash. Or hay darts if you wanna unleash the hay at them.

[02:35:27] Speaker 29: 19.

[02:35:29] Speaker 2: Yep, that would hit. And each goblin here only has like six points of health, so it won't do too much to kill some.

[02:35:35] Speaker 29: That's more than six.

[02:35:37] Speaker 2: Okay. So yep, you guys, you, um, you'll spray some darts as you're going and, um, you can choose to either do it against a single goblin or you can just spray them with it. Um, if you spray them with it, yeah, that, that forces them to kinda get their head down. It r- reduces any attacks coming against you guys.

[02:35:54] Speaker 28: Sure, I can do that at 10.

[02:35:56] Speaker 2: Um, next up.

[02:35:57] Speaker 28: Uh, next up is me. Put my character name there though.

[02:36:02] Speaker 2: (laughs)

[02:36:05] Speaker 28: Okay, um, I will try and intimidate one of the goblins. Hey, back off before we chop the livers outta you.

[02:36:13] Speaker 24: (laughs)

[02:36:14] Speaker 2: This is more of a skill type thing. Again, so this could be, you know, intimidating all of them-

[02:36:17] Speaker 24: Yeah.

[02:36:17] Speaker 2: ... on certain sides.

[02:36:19] Speaker 28: Um, dirty 20.

[02:36:20] Speaker 2: Dirty 20? Okay. Um, 10 plus there. This is Will. All right.

[02:36:30] Speaker 24: E.

[02:36:31] Speaker 2: That would succeed. You think you are, um... These may be young goblins but maybe they've heard the stories of the slayers and, yeah, they're... You can tell them, you know, if you're just standing up there shouting at them, that's pretty intimidating for goblins who have, uh, I don't know, fiber scales.

[02:36:48] Speaker 28: Um, Aurelia is on deck.

[02:36:50] Speaker 30: Do I get two more actions, or?

[02:36:51] Speaker 2: Yeah. I mean, generally you take three actions you want... Uh, basically, but this is more of a skill check.

[02:36:55] Speaker 31: Yeah, I think I-

[02:36:56] Speaker 2: I'd rather just save my actions, so. (laughs)

[02:36:59] Speaker 30: Yeah.

[02:36:59] Speaker 32: All right. Aurelia is up next. Kaltal is on deck. That's, hey, it's table order. (instrumental music)

[02:37:06] Speaker 2: So, again, this is like more of a skill check thing. What do you wanna do to try to... It could be an attack, it could be a skill, something to try to... (instrumental music) So far they've been sprayed pretty accurately with some needle darts.

[02:37:18] Speaker 33: Who's driving these carts?

[02:37:19] Speaker 2: There are people, there are caravan people who are driving it. You can also instruct the caravan people to do something if you wanna arrange, um... It's a fairly wide road, so if you want to have them go to a different arrangement, you can ask them to do that.

[02:37:33] Speaker 34: If we leap, hmm, I was gonna say if we leaped off the carts, we would be able to catch up to them?

[02:37:40] Speaker 2: Carts are moving pretty quick. And you think if you hop off the carts onto the ground...

[02:37:44] Speaker 34: You're not gonna catch up to it, got it.

[02:37:46] Speaker 2: And then you're gonna have like 15 goblins and probably die a, a pin cushiony death. You could try to jump from one cart to the other. I mean, that, you know, there's a coolness factor that's always...

[02:37:56] Speaker 34: Hmm, nope, I'll take potshots at the goblin.

[02:38:01] Speaker 2: Okay, yep. You can just, yeah, go ahead and roll. See how your... taking some potshots as you go, see how you're generally doing.

[02:38:08] Speaker 34: 15.

[02:38:10] Speaker 2: Um, yeah, you're pretty accurate. I do mean you don't kill any, but combined with his needle darts, you can take some potshots as you go when you're forcing the goblins to kind of duck for cover a little bit. Last but not least.

[02:38:26] Speaker 31: I don't really have anything that is helpful, so he's just gonna, like, crouch down so he's harder to hit and, you know, maybe keep an eye on the driver to make sure the driver doesn't need any assistance controlling the horses.

[02:38:39] Speaker 2: (laughs) Yeah, you could do that. Like I said, if you wanna do a different arrangement with the carts, you can always do that too.

[02:38:46] Speaker 31: That's... Which ha- uh, correct pa- path is... The correct path is clearly to get through this. So we just want the carts to not get distracted or the horses to spook or anything like that.

[02:38:58] Speaker 2: Hmm, um, so we'll do another round. The, to continue along this way, there's still, you know, a lot of goblins coming up taking off. No, actually in between rounds-

[02:39:05] Speaker 31: Yeah, the goblins get a turn before.

[02:39:07] Speaker 2: So, um, basically they're, they're just taking little slings and slinging at you guys. Probably minimal damage, but, uh, they're still taking some shots. And their heads are kind of down because you guys have effectively kind of intimidated them and got them hiding and whatnot. So we'll just kind of go from side to side. So you have to roll really high. They don't get you against any shots on you. One of them crits you.

[02:39:30] Speaker 31: Ah.

[02:39:31] Speaker 2: So they don't do a lot of damage here. These are just little slings. So one of them hits you, uh, Aurelia, for three points of damage.

[02:39:37] Speaker 31: Right.

[02:39:37] Speaker 2: Um, against your guy, they're just slinging at you.

[02:39:39] Speaker 32: Yeah, AC18.

[02:39:41] Speaker 2: Um, they both would hit an AC18, but just barely.

[02:39:44] Speaker 32: Boom.

[02:39:45] Speaker 2: If they did well 15 and 16, they wouldn't have, so. Um, two and three is five points of damage altogether.

[02:39:53] Speaker 31: Oh, no. My rage temptation-

[02:39:53] Speaker 2: And last but not least, there's just a bunch of... a hail of shots. One of them is going to be a 20 something to hit you.

[02:39:59] Speaker 34: That's great. That's cool.

[02:39:59] Speaker 2: And that's going to be...

[02:40:00] Speaker 32: Yeah, I mean, tomorrow ready to go.

[02:40:01] Speaker 2: Two points of damage from the rocks they're slinging at you. Okay, we go to the next round. Again, you can do skill checks, basically things to get them to... Different things you can think of.

[02:40:11] Speaker 32: Starting with Matthew.

[02:40:14] Speaker 2: And actually, I'll give you a second to think because I'm gonna get some more water. Do you need something as well or anyone else need a drink? Okay, I'll be right back. (instrumental music)

[02:40:32] Speaker 32: Yeah, this is a tough position for the melee characters.

[02:40:39] Speaker 34: Which everyone's your own... Well, no, I don't know that. Never mind.

[02:40:43] Speaker 32: Well, I threw one at the orc yesterday, a couple of days ago, whenever it was. But yeah, it is.

[02:40:57] Speaker 34: Do we have to tell the NPCs to do something or do they just do stuff on their own?

[02:41:03] Speaker 2: I mean, they're driving the carts on their own. If you want them to do anything special, you could ask them to do that.

[02:41:07] Speaker 34: Hmm, got it. Okay.

[02:41:09] Speaker 2: You could use diplomacy to try to, um, you know, encourage them or to request they do something different than just drive the wagon. Um...

[02:41:19] Speaker 34: Yeah, if they're driving, no, that's important.

[02:41:21] Speaker 31: I only have 20 feet of speed. Oh my God, I had no idea.

[02:41:24] Speaker 34: Short legs.

[02:41:25] Speaker 33: Welcome to being a dwarf, my friend.

[02:41:27] Speaker 32: Yeah.

[02:41:28] Speaker 34: (laughs)

[02:41:28] Speaker 33: The greatest race of all time.

[02:41:30] Speaker 30: Like a little corgi, just wee.

[02:41:32] Speaker 34: (laughs)

[02:41:33] Speaker 2: They can eventually take fleet.

[02:41:34] Speaker 33: We are excellent sprinters. We do not do well on these long distances.

[02:41:39] Speaker 30: Apparently, you're not a great sprinter either. (laughs)

[02:41:43] Speaker 33: I am lying up my ass.

[02:41:44] Speaker 34: (laughs)

[02:41:46] Speaker 30: Um-

[02:41:46] Speaker 2: I don't know what they... I... In the old edition, I know there's a feat you can take, the barbarian feat that when you're raging, you get bonus speed. I don't know how that works in the remaster.

[02:41:55] Speaker 32: We'll see if it comes up or not.

[02:41:57] Speaker 2: It should, 'cause I know they do get something tied to that.

[02:42:00] Speaker 31: Um, these are goblins, and you said that they're superstitious?

[02:42:04] Speaker 2: Yep.

[02:42:05] Speaker 31: Then I would like to make an occultism check to make like the symbol of the evil eye at them to intimidate them into, uh, leaving us alone.

[02:42:15] Speaker 2: Yep, you can do that. Yeah, they're definitely-

[02:42:16] Speaker 34: You picked another occultism character, of course.

[02:42:19] Speaker 31: Well, I didn't intend to.

[02:42:22] Speaker 34: (laughs)

[02:42:22] Speaker 2: (laughs)

[02:42:22] Speaker 32: (laughs)

[02:42:22] Speaker 31: But it was the, it was the option for my particular class that I was interested in, and it just-

[02:42:28] Speaker 2: Sorcerer.

[02:42:28] Speaker 34: (laughs)

[02:42:29] Speaker 31: Yes. I'm totally a sorcerer.

[02:42:32] Speaker 34: That's a 2.0.

[02:42:33] Speaker 31: (laughs) Sorcerer is what he would call himself if anyone sees him doing magic. All right, uh-

[02:42:42] Speaker 34: That's a lot. 20.

[02:42:43] Speaker 31: Total of 20.

[02:42:45] Speaker 2: Okay, yeah, that's more than good enough. So, yeah, as some of the goblins who are watching you see that, you see they start... Some of them actually start panicking and running away.

[02:42:53] Speaker 34: (laughs) Cowards.

[02:42:54] Speaker 2: Um, and some of the other ones are kind of reconsidering their life decisions at this moment.

[02:42:58] Speaker 34: (laughs)

[02:43:00] Speaker 2: So you guys have one good success against him.

[02:43:01] Speaker 35: Oh, that's great.

[02:43:02] Speaker 2: Next up.

[02:43:02] Speaker 36: Um, I will try and rally the driver. My friend, I remember the time that I once got locked in a goblin stew. It was not a good experience. You must move on. And diplomacy, uh, that's a 14.

[02:43:22] Speaker 2: Um, given the circumstance, um, he would probably do that. He whips the horse a little bit harder. He doesn't get a lot of speed, so it's not a full success, but I mean, it was enough that maybe he'll... You know, you guys notice he's starting to gain on you guys. Maybe, uh-

[02:43:36] Speaker 36: Oh, I'm in the front car.

[02:43:37] Speaker 2: Oh, you're the front one? Yeah, so you're actually-

[02:43:39] Speaker 36: So you leave him behind.

[02:43:40] Speaker 2: He goes, you guys, behind.

[02:43:41] Speaker 36: See ya, guys.

[02:43:41] Speaker 2: Little bit further away.

[02:43:44] Speaker 35: Okay.

[02:43:45] Speaker 2: Next up.

[02:43:47] Speaker 35: Seeing that, I would probably inspire and encourage our driver to be like, w- uh, "We can't l- can't l- can't lose them."

[02:44:03] Speaker 2: So you could probably do, um, well obviously diplomacy or you could do intimidation, just tell him to move his ass, or you could do bluff to say, "They're gaining on us, move it."

[02:44:13] Speaker 35: Um, 14.

[02:44:15] Speaker 2: Okay, which one are you using?

[02:44:16] Speaker 35: Uh...

[02:44:22] Speaker 2: Ideally before you roll but, uh-

[02:44:24] Speaker 35: Yeah. Intimidation.

[02:44:27] Speaker 2: Intimidation? Um, I mean he's not particularly intimidated. He's more like frustrated right now. I mean, a 14's good. You'll pick up a little bit of speed but, um, he's like, you know, um, "I heard you the first time. Don't, uh... I'm doing my, just doing my job. Laugh at back, mom." Um, so next up.

[02:44:49] Speaker 7: Having seen what my warlock friend has done.

[02:44:54] Speaker 37: (laughs)

[02:44:54] Speaker 35: (laughs)

[02:44:55] Speaker 7: Not a witch.

[02:44:58] Speaker 37: (laughs)

[02:44:59] Speaker 7: He's, he's a man. He's a warlock. I will stand and begin and I will also... I rec- I recognized it because of my knowledge, um, and I will begin...

[02:45:13] Speaker 35: (laughs)

[02:45:14] Speaker 7: I will make up some kind of like, chant that calls upon whatever the evil god-

[02:45:20] Speaker 35: (laughs)

[02:45:20] Speaker 7: ... is that they are paranoid about and, and call, and call down his wrath, you know, upon them to further frighten them with occultism. That is 13.

[02:45:36] Speaker 2: Probably not a n- I mean, the only thing is also language gap. Like, yours was visual right? They saw the...

[02:45:41] Speaker 38: Yeah, um-

[02:45:42] Speaker 2: Um-

[02:45:42] Speaker 38: I was making a specific hand gesture.

[02:45:44] Speaker 2: No, I mean if you were saying things you might have said something that maybe of caused it to glow a little bit harder but the thing is not particularly high though, so it doesn't... But it get, he'll pour into her anyway. So now we go to the next round, the goblins are still shouting. Um, both Sylvia and uh, um, Lynn have, you know, various things they'll do to help out with the guardsmen. Um, you notice that some of the goblins, um, on the side start yelping and chanting and you hear this really weird growl sound as things are moving and as you look behind you-

[02:46:18] Speaker 35: Uh-oh.

[02:46:18] Speaker 2: ... first you see some goblins chasing you.

[02:46:24] Speaker 35: Let me guess, they brought a bag of wargs.

[02:46:26] Speaker 7: Brought in spiders. And I'm going to move you guys forward a little bit.

[02:46:30] Speaker 35: Bringing spiders?

[02:46:31] Speaker 36: Spiders.

[02:46:33] Speaker 2: So yes, you still have some goblins.

[02:46:35] Speaker 36: Don't let them gunk up the wheels.

[02:46:37] Speaker 2: 'Cause that's not the only thing you see, and move a little bit further.

[02:46:41] Speaker 35: Uh-oh.

[02:46:42] Speaker 2: You have... They're skittering, yelping things at you and alongside them, you have some bouncing things.

[02:46:58] Speaker 38: Mm.

[02:47:01] Speaker 35: Here my brain is imagining like classic goblins riding wargs. Uh, nope.

[02:47:07] Speaker 36: Yeah, I- my brain also went there.

[02:47:08] Speaker 35: (laughs) I was just like, "Oh, okay, we got warg riders." I was like, "Wait a minute."

[02:47:12] Speaker 7: Mm-hmm. This isn't Lord of The Rings, it's Pathfinder.

[02:47:17] Speaker 2: So yep, they're skittering at you. Um, so, um, we'll do the two riders on one initiative and then we'll do the, uh, spider riders. And then the squigs we'll do as, uh, red and blue why not? We'll do 'em in two groups. One and two. Yeah, these have to sit on top.

[02:47:52] Speaker 35: Ne- they need, uh, square number things like that for square platforms.

[02:47:57] Speaker 2: Yeah. I think, uh, if I can... These are the only ones with circles. Well, I can make them bigger and then it would work but those guys weren't... So, um... Oh yeah, initiative's on.

[02:48:09] Speaker 36: So it's the reds paired together or the ones paired together?

[02:48:11] Speaker 2: Uh, the reds.

[02:48:12] Speaker 36: Okay.

[02:48:12] Speaker 2: Reds and blues.

[02:48:13] Speaker 36: Gotcha.

[02:48:14] Speaker 2: Um, so, uh, the riders... I think it's a... There we go. Um, we have a 16 here. And in their cases, they're, the spiders or their amount is one thing, so can only tag them independently. And I got to mark those as one and two also. Um, group red is 19. Red, one eye. And blue is 11.... same. So we're gonna do skull and stripes. Skull having a skull and stripes having the stripes. Okay. So who, uh, top of the order? Who's up?

[02:49:21] Speaker 39: Uh, that would be Arnor still. Do the goblins not get a turn or was summoning the people their turn?

[02:49:28] Speaker 2: Um, they didn't summon 'em. These have been chasing you.

[02:49:30] Speaker 39: Right.

[02:49:30] Speaker 2: They kinda jump outta the bush. These guys, es- especially because of like the religious and other stuff you guys are doing, the, the imposing... dwarf and whatnot, um, they've, they're kinda head on. Yes, you do have missiles and whatnot shooting at you guys, but I'm actually, well, you'll probably take a rock or two to the head here and there. But not enough to really...

[02:49:50] Speaker 39: Okay. Well, on Arnor then. Uh, Squig, Aara and the goblins are gone, the riders are in back.

[02:49:56] Speaker 40: Yeah. Uh, I'm gonna cast the spell biting words. I entwine my magic with my voice causing your taunts and jaw- jibes to physically harm your enemies. Um, and then I can make an attack roll, uh, as, as I finish casting it and then I can use it again up to three more times.

[02:50:20] Speaker 2: Is there a range?

[02:50:21] Speaker 40: Unless-

[02:50:21] Speaker 2: Oh, is there a range on it I'm curiosing about?

[02:50:22] Speaker 40: Oh, you're right. Oh, what's the range? 30 feet. 30-

[02:50:28] Speaker 2: What you might be able to do, 'cause you're right there, they're pretty far.

[02:50:31] Speaker 40: You could-

[02:50:32] Speaker 2: 10, 15, 20, 25. Ah, they're just outside 30. You could ready it. If you spend one more action you could ready it. And when they move into range, which they probably will-

[02:50:41] Speaker 40: Yeah.

[02:50:41] Speaker 2: ... you cast it at that point.

[02:50:42] Speaker 40: All right. So, I will cast it and ready the use of it and when they come in range, I will insult them. (laughs)

[02:50:51] Speaker 2: (laughs) Okay. And who is, so then who is next? It was-

[02:50:53] Speaker 39: Squig, Aara.

[02:50:54] Speaker 2: Okay, the reds.

[02:50:56] Speaker 40: Um-

[02:50:56] Speaker 39: Goblin riders are after that.

[02:51:00] Speaker 40: I'm gonna ready it for one of the spider, spider riders. (laughs)

[02:51:02] Speaker 2: So your coins are bounciers.

[02:51:04] Speaker 40: I don't want it.

[02:51:05] Speaker 2: So they bounce?

[02:51:07] Speaker 40: They always throw in a little ones. Yeah. It is a level 12 spell.

[02:51:12] Speaker 2: Bounce. There. That was one action. Do a balance again.

[02:51:22] Speaker 39: I'm in the wrong cart.

[02:51:23] Speaker 40: (laughs)

[02:51:24] Speaker 39: Yeah.

[02:51:25] Speaker 2: Bounce.

[02:51:26] Speaker 41: I contemplated leaping to the front cart, but I don't know if I'm gonna-

[02:51:29] Speaker 2: There.

[02:51:30] Speaker 41: Do that.

[02:51:30] Speaker 2: He was gonna go there.

[02:51:31] Speaker 39: There's a spot at the back.

[02:51:31] Speaker 2: He'll go up to one of you two. This one would bounce, he is a 35, he's gonna bounce to there and he's gonna take a chomp at one of the ones on that side of the two NPCs, luckily. Um, so the one attack on the two on that side. Let's see. Um, even/odd. Even. So it's attacking Aurelia with its one attack. Um-

[02:51:55] Speaker 40: Great.

[02:51:58] Speaker 2: (coughs) Excuse me. (laughs) Here we go.

[02:52:05] Speaker 41: What are... These are like-

[02:52:07] Speaker 2: These are-

[02:52:07] Speaker 41: ... bouncing reptiles?

[02:52:10] Speaker 2: You can always do a, uh, recall knowledge to find out what they are. Which is a good thing for your character to have, by the way. Um, they attack you for a 19, actually be an 18 because remember there is a negative one to all attacks here.

[02:52:21] Speaker 41: That hits.

[02:52:22] Speaker 2: Hits for, uh, eight points of damage. Okay. Uh, that's it for him. The other guy will attack one of the two NPCs. Uh, he'll hit for three. Five actually. And that would be, so... Okay. Uh, next up was the riders.

[02:52:54] Speaker 40: Yep.

[02:52:54] Speaker 2: They're scurrying, so one goes two or three squares forward. I think two, we'll say three and then your ability will go off.

[02:53:01] Speaker 40: Yep. All right. So, (dice rolling) yeah. 12.

[02:53:13] Speaker 2: Uh, 12. And you're attacking the... And this is the roll to hit?

[02:53:18] Speaker 40: Mm-hmm.

[02:53:19] Speaker 2: Uh, would miss.

[02:53:20] Speaker 40: All right. One use down. Just have to keep track. Right. That's it.

[02:53:30] Speaker 2: Okay. Good, then continue scurrying up. It's probably only going to take two actions to get up to you guys here. Probably attack, since you're the closest one, he'd attack Aurelia.

[02:53:39] Speaker 40: Good.

[02:53:40] Speaker 2: Um-

[02:53:42] Speaker 39: I think gray.

[02:53:43] Speaker 2: (laughs) 24.

[02:53:47] Speaker 40: That's a hit.

[02:53:49] Speaker 2: Uh, for a grand total of four points of damage.

[02:53:53] Speaker 40: I know.

[02:53:56] Speaker 39: Already?

[02:53:57] Speaker 41: I, the last attack had took out like seven of my hit points.

[02:54:03] Speaker 39: Oh, no.

[02:54:06] Speaker 2: Okay. Well, I'm not gonna knock you down though, there it was.

[02:54:08] Speaker 39: No, you aren't. Too crowded.

[02:54:10] Speaker 2: And next up. Oh, the other guy.

[02:54:12] Speaker 39: The goblin rider.

[02:54:13] Speaker 40: (coughs)

[02:54:14] Speaker 2: Only get to attack is Lynn. Um, he crits.

[02:54:20] Speaker 39: Lynn. No.

[02:54:22] Speaker 2: Okay. Um, next up.

[02:54:25] Speaker 39: Next is me. Um, Aurelia is not on deck 'cause things moved around.

[02:54:29] Speaker 2: And you guys, as part of your action, you can tell the driver to do things so he could, you can tell him to slow down and blitz which would allow you guys to... effectively, I guess you can move the cart backwards if you wanted to.

[02:54:41] Speaker 39: Yeah, by slowing down.

[02:54:43] Speaker 2: Yeah.

[02:54:43] Speaker 39: Not by actually moving backwards.

[02:54:44] Speaker 40: Yeah. My worry is just th- that cart is so crowded and like how am I gonna jump on it?

[02:54:49] Speaker 2: You necessarily have to 'cause you can stall your car to-

[02:54:52] Speaker 40: Make the cart side-by-side.

[02:54:53] Speaker 2: Yeah. You can do the-

[02:54:54] Speaker 41: Is this path, is the wide path wide enough for side-by-side?

[02:54:58] Speaker 2: Yeah. I- like this one here, it is wide enough you guys could do that. If you're slightly off the road, it's not gonna impact it too much.

[02:55:04] Speaker 39: Uh, blue is on deck.

[02:55:05] Speaker 2: Oh.

[02:55:06] Speaker 39: But question, like would it be an action to convey that to them?

[02:55:09] Speaker 2: Yeah. It'd be an action and it'd allow you guys to move it backwards. Because otherwise yeah, you're outta the fight and it's kinda important for you guys.

[02:55:16] Speaker 39: "Driver, pull up to the side with the other cart." (laughs)

[02:55:19] Speaker 2: So he'll do that, which I'll give it, like, 35. But it could move at least this turn, like, to right there if you want.

[02:55:24] Speaker 39: Okay. I'll take that.

[02:55:25] Speaker 2: And then, yeah, then you can be-

[02:55:26] Speaker 39: Yeah, I'll back away for that. I thought maybe I'd have to wait until the turn after that-

[02:55:30] Speaker 2: Uh-huh.

[02:55:30] Speaker 39: ... so I'm really happy it happened this turn. Um, yeah. Walked away.

[02:55:34] Speaker 42: Did you use... You guys are on level one each time around.

[02:55:35] Speaker 43: Did he use his reaction? The driver used his reaction to do it on you.

[02:55:38] Speaker 39: Oh, yeah. He was ready to action.

[02:55:39] Speaker 42: (laughs)

[02:55:40] Speaker 43: He had a reaction.

[02:55:41] Speaker 2: He's not gonna argue with the dwarven slayer.

[02:55:44] Speaker 39: Um, does a 12 hit?

[02:55:45] Speaker 44: Good plan.

[02:55:46] Speaker 2: Um, let's see. These guys will not... No, there's... They have a decently-

[02:55:52] Speaker 39: Yeah.

[02:55:52] Speaker 2: ... thick hide.

[02:55:54] Speaker 39: You know what? I really wanna hit.

[02:55:57] Speaker 2: And we're getting close to the next one.

[02:55:59] Speaker 39: Okay, does the 13 hit?

[02:56:01] Speaker 2: (laughs) No, unfortunately.

[02:56:03] Speaker 39: Ah. Oh, actually it would have been 12 with the penalty. Um, second attack. Not 20. Okay. (laughs) Uh, that's, uh, three plus one, so... Uh, 14 bludgeoning and six spirit.

[02:56:22] Speaker 2: (laughs) That is weird enough, just enough. These are tough little buggers.

[02:56:28] Speaker 39: Well, not that tough.

[02:56:29] Speaker 2: Yeah.

[02:56:30] Speaker 39: Wha-ch. Swing. Ba-da-ba-da-ba.

[02:56:33] Speaker 2: You don't know what you killed. Basically, uh, a mouth with legs. But, uh, (laughs) yeah, you pretty much-

[02:56:39] Speaker 39: This place is gonna be so much fun.

[02:56:41] Speaker 2: ... battered him right up.

[02:56:42] Speaker 39: And that is my turn. Next up is Blue.

[02:56:45] Speaker 2: Yeah, you notice the dwarf's enjoying himself a little too much right now.

[02:56:47] Speaker 39: Mm-hmm.

[02:56:49] Speaker 2: Um, so Blue is next. Um, I just gotta take, um, two actions to get... It's probably taking him all three actions to balance. Here, I'm probably gonna say it's taking him all three actions to balance up to there. Um...

[02:57:03] Speaker 39: Getting run over by the cart?

[02:57:04] Speaker 2: No, they're jumping. They're kinda just balancing right beside it.

[02:57:09] Speaker 39: KotalH is up. Um, then we're at the end of the round if the goblins are going to do anything.

[02:57:14] Speaker 2: Oh. Uh, no, I'll let you...

[02:57:16] Speaker 42: I like... I yell, "Move us back further." (laughs)

[02:57:20] Speaker 2: (laughs) Um, yeah, he could still move us back.

[02:57:21] Speaker 39: He has another reaction.

[02:57:24] Speaker 42: Can he run over the one?

[02:57:26] Speaker 45: That's enough. Don't care.

[02:57:28] Speaker 42: Uh-uh.

[02:57:29] Speaker 45: And then I will use my-

[02:57:30] Speaker 39: 'Cause he's not moving back.

[02:57:30] Speaker 45: I have reach. I will, uh, flurry the mouth.

[02:57:34] Speaker 2: What you should do is hop on the carts and just, you know, doing the splits over the-

[02:57:38] Speaker 44: (laughs)

[02:57:39] Speaker 45: My god.

[02:57:40] Speaker 2: The rule of cool is always in effect, so...

[02:57:43] Speaker 42: Um, 18.

[02:57:46] Speaker 2: 18. Oh, let's see. Guess that guy would hit.

[02:57:49] Speaker 44: Yay.

[02:57:50] Speaker 42: That was nine bludgeoning.

[02:57:53] Speaker 2: And that is rue, uh... Let's see, that's...

[02:57:54] Speaker 42: Blue two.

[02:57:56] Speaker 2: Blue two. The second attack missed. Final action as Parry.

[02:58:04] Speaker 42: Blue two. And then blue one was dead. No, blue one's over there.

[02:58:06] Speaker 39: Blue one's on the other side.

[02:58:07] Speaker 2: The other guy's dead. Okay. Um, so how much did you do to him? To Blue two?

[02:58:11] Speaker 42: Uh, five plus four, nine.

[02:58:13] Speaker 2: Nine? Okay, that's a good solid blow.

[02:58:14] Speaker 39: Think you oughta use one of your actions to pull us back, so... Another one for the-

[02:58:19] Speaker 2: Well, it'd be a flurry.

[02:58:20] Speaker 42: It's flurry blows, so... One to move now.

[02:58:23] Speaker 2: It's one action.

[02:58:24] Speaker 39: Oh, flurry's one?

[02:58:25] Speaker 42: Yeah.

[02:58:25] Speaker 2: Yeah, flurry's not as good as the... Well, 'cause a ranger one is just two action. Flurry's one action, but you have the multiple attack penalty.

[02:58:30] Speaker 39: Mm.

[02:58:31] Speaker 42: It's just action efficiency, not-

[02:58:33] Speaker 2: Yeah.

[02:58:34] Speaker 39: It's been a while since I've played more. I forgot.

[02:58:36] Speaker 45: Hey, everyone.

[02:58:36] Speaker 2: The ranger one is nice, though. Two... It's two actions, but two attacks with no map, you know, no penalty-

[02:58:41] Speaker 39: That's good.

[02:58:41] Speaker 2: ... is really nice.

[02:58:42] Speaker 39: Yeah. Okay, um, let's do these goblins.

[02:58:45] Speaker 42: This means I have leftover action for Perry.

[02:58:47] Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.

[02:58:47] Speaker 44: Oh, wait. Do I go before the, the viking guys?

[02:58:48] Speaker 39: Or do another funky stuff.

[02:58:49] Speaker 42: Yeah. Or eventually I'll have to-

[02:58:50] Speaker 45: You, you're mission of goblin move, you're gonna go before the goblin army.

[02:58:53] Speaker 39: You're gonna go before the goblins.

[02:58:53] Speaker 42: Oh, shit.

[02:58:54] Speaker 39: The goblin riders were the ones that took you down, right?

[02:58:56] Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.

[02:58:57] Speaker 39: Yeah.

[02:58:57] Speaker 44: Yeah, the one on the spider did.

[02:58:59] Speaker 39: Yeah. Uh, so-

[02:59:00] Speaker 42: So you get moved right before the thing that killed you so that the rest of the party has the maximum amount of time to get you stable before the guy killed you goes again.

[02:59:08] Speaker 44: Hey.

[02:59:08] Speaker 39: Sucks that I got no healing.

[02:59:10] Speaker 2: (laughs) Yeah, probably the one, the, the missing party member at the, uh, (laughs) camp also happens to be the one with some pretty good, uh, healing. Well, I don't know how much.

[02:59:18] Speaker 42: I s- haven't noticed any cli- Gee, it'd be nice if there was a cleric in the party.

[02:59:23] Speaker 44: (laughs)

[02:59:23] Speaker 2: (laughs)

[02:59:24] Speaker 42: I think in last week's session, there was an announcement that we might have a cleric.

[02:59:28] Speaker 2: (laughs)

[02:59:29] Speaker 44: Maybe.

[02:59:31] Speaker 39: Uh, goblins, if they're doing anything, otherwise I'm out.

[02:59:33] Speaker 42: I think it was cleric, monk, uh, barbarian, sorcerer-

[02:59:36] Speaker 2: Who is next? I'm sorry.

[02:59:37] Speaker 39: And goblins, if they're doing anything.

[02:59:38] Speaker 42: ... and rogue.

[02:59:39] Speaker 2: Um, no. They'll basically just keep chucking rocks at you guys, but they're pretty im- intimidated at this point.

[02:59:44] Speaker 39: All right. R&R is next, uh, followed by Red.

[02:59:48] Speaker 42: (gurgles)

[02:59:49] Speaker 43: All right. We're gonna start with, uh, my biting words. So I will target the goblin rider that's closest to-
---

[02:59:58] Speaker 1: Looks to me...

[03:00:00] Speaker 2: Okay, yeah, that would be Stripes.

[03:00:02] Speaker 1: Oh. Uh, Jesus. 26.

[03:00:09] Speaker 2: That'll hit. As a matter of fact, that's going to crit.

[03:00:14] Speaker 1: Oh, yay. (dice clattering) Uh, 17 sonic damage.

[03:00:27] Speaker 2: That is a really... He's still up now. The others have more hit points because of the spider but, yeah, he and the spider are oozing a lot of different colored oozes.

[03:00:37] Speaker 1: Well, let's see if I can, uh, help with that. Um, I would like the spider rider that I just hit and the squig there, um... Actually, no, I'll target the squig guy over here.

[03:00:50] Speaker 2: Thank you. (laughs)

[03:00:50] Speaker 1: Uh, so you have something to continue trying to hit. (laughs) Um, with electric arc.

[03:00:55] Speaker 2: Okay.

[03:00:55] Speaker 1: They need to make a DC15 reflex save.

[03:01:00] Speaker 3: 28.

[03:01:01] Speaker 1: Nah, not anymore.

[03:01:02] Speaker 2: (laughs) Yeah.

[03:01:03] Speaker 3: Oh, the olden days.

[03:01:04] Speaker 1: Or, uh, the other-

[03:01:05] Speaker 2: So the one you just hit saved but not crit, so I think he takes half damage.

[03:01:08] Speaker 1: He'll take half damage.

[03:01:09] Speaker 2: The squig on the other side is probably going to fail. Let me see what exactly happened. That was will?

[03:01:16] Speaker 1: Uh, reflex.

[03:01:17] Speaker 2: Oh, reflex. Um, that'd be, uh... When you said a 15?

[03:01:21] Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

[03:01:21] Speaker 2: That would be a barely fail. He almost crit failed.

[03:01:26] Speaker 1: Okay.

[03:01:27] Speaker 2: And where's everyone at for coins?

[03:01:29] Speaker 1: Uh, this one-

[03:01:29] Speaker 3: I have one.

[03:01:30] Speaker 4: Me and Katie.

[03:01:31] Speaker 2: Okay, go ahead and throw a lot.

[03:01:34] Speaker 4: 10.

[03:01:34] Speaker 5: Nine. (laughs)

[03:01:36] Speaker 2: (laughs)

[03:01:37] Speaker 1: (laughs) You keep rolling one above everybody. (laughs)

[03:01:39] Speaker 4: I feel bad 'cause you're going down. (laughs)

[03:01:42] Speaker 1: All right. Um, so the one that passed will take half damage, the other will take full.

[03:01:47] Speaker 4: Can I choose to give mine to Katie just so she doesn't die? (laughs)

[03:01:52] Speaker 2: I don't think you can pass them, that I know of.

[03:01:54] Speaker 4: Damn. All right, I tried.

[03:01:55] Speaker 1: Six. It is-

[03:01:56] Speaker 4: We got MPCs, some of us.

[03:01:57] Speaker 5: He's, he's full.

[03:01:58] Speaker 2: So three.

[03:01:58] Speaker 5: Pops are trying.

[03:01:59] Speaker 2: Well, guess what you needed to kill the spider rider?

[03:02:02] Speaker 4: Yay.

[03:02:03] Speaker 2: (laughs)

[03:02:03] Speaker 4: It was one... The both MPCs are in there with you and one of them stabilized last time, so maybe one of them will stabilize you this time. Hopefully.

[03:02:11] Speaker 2: Um, and then the other one took six, so red won.

[03:02:16] Speaker 4: Electric arc is badass at level one. (laughs)

[03:02:19] Speaker 2: Yeah.

[03:02:21] Speaker 4: Take six. Two targets with a decent amount of damage.

[03:02:24] Speaker 2: Yeah.

[03:02:25] Speaker 5: That's why I took it when I saw it. I was like, "That's bad."

[03:02:28] Speaker 4: It loses its luster at level 10 but (laughs) level one it's still pretty awesome.

[03:02:33] Speaker 2: Hopeful. That's...

[03:02:33] Speaker 1: It's just nice having an extra imaging cap trip.

[03:02:35] Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, who's next?

[03:02:36] Speaker 1: I don't have a ton of options for that.

[03:02:37] Speaker 4: Squid, squid. Uh, squid red.

[03:02:39] Speaker 2: Or, oh, I'm sorry, which one?

[03:02:40] Speaker 4: The red.

[03:02:41] Speaker 2: Red? Oh, okay.

[03:02:42] Speaker 1: Especially since I'm-

[03:02:43] Speaker 4: There's only one, only one left.

[03:02:44] Speaker 2: No, there's two.

[03:02:45] Speaker 1: Yeah, there's one on this side.

[03:02:47] Speaker 2: Oh, well, there's also a red one.

[03:02:48] Speaker 4: There's only one red.

[03:02:48] Speaker 2: Yeah, gotcha. Um, he can only attack the MPCs. He's probably going to go for Lynn 'cause he'd been chomping on Lynn.

[03:02:54] Speaker 4: Red.

[03:02:55] Speaker 5: Red.

[03:02:56] Speaker 2: Let me see if that-

[03:02:56] Speaker 4: She's immune.

[03:02:57] Speaker 2: He misses.

[03:02:59] Speaker 4: Lynn, you better get him, uh, Lynn gotta get killed. She's an MPC. Yeah. Oh, yeah. And let me know when the inter... In, in the inner round happens. The end so I can-

[03:03:07] Speaker 5: The end of the round.

[03:03:08] Speaker 2: End of the round.

[03:03:08] Speaker 4: They're at the end of the round.

[03:03:09] Speaker 1: Have we passed-

[03:03:10] Speaker 4: MPCs are always last.

[03:03:11] Speaker 1: Well, the goblins did nothing. That would've been the end of the round.

[03:03:13] Speaker 2: Okay. So, um, basically those two will get an action. Lynn will turn around. He will, um, pull out from his pouch, um, a healing potion-

[03:03:23] Speaker 4: Oh, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.

[03:03:23] Speaker 2: ... and he'll put that down your throat.

[03:03:25] Speaker 4: Yay.

[03:03:25] Speaker 2: So healing does what? You guys remember? Top of your head. Is it D8?

[03:03:30] Speaker 1: I only know 5B.

[03:03:32] Speaker 2: Yeah.

[03:03:33] Speaker 4: It depends on the level.

[03:03:34] Speaker 1: This is the basic one.

[03:03:35] Speaker 2: This is the basic one.

[03:03:36] Speaker 4: Shitting on mine are 1D8.

[03:03:37] Speaker 1: It's gonna be your turn, by the way. You get two points back at least.

[03:03:40] Speaker 4: And you're conscious.

[03:03:41] Speaker 1: And you're conscious.

[03:03:42] Speaker 5: Two hit points, whoop.

[03:03:44] Speaker 1: Whoops.

[03:03:45] Speaker 4: Stay down on the ground. They can't hurt you if you're hiding below the wall of the...

[03:03:51] Speaker 5: Yeah.

[03:03:51] Speaker 4: You're laying... You, you would be laying on the ground of the cart. You dropped everything you were holding also.

[03:03:57] Speaker 5: Yeah.

[03:03:57] Speaker 4: So you don't have your weapon.

[03:03:58] Speaker 2: One thing is, you can shoot from the... While you're... As long as you can see him, you can shoot laying down and it's not a problem.

[03:04:03] Speaker 5: Yeah.

[03:04:04] Speaker 4: Couldn't she see through, like... Does the carts actually look like that or is that, like, little gaps you can shoot through?

[03:04:09] Speaker 2: I, uh, yeah, they're like that and you could... Yeah, I'd say you could shoot through it.

[03:04:10] Speaker 4: There's probably little gaps there anyway.

[03:04:12] Speaker 5: Pew.

[03:04:13] Speaker 2: You guys are on, standing on top of actual, kind of... There is some luggage and stuff in there.

[03:04:18] Speaker 4: Oh, okay.

[03:04:18] Speaker 2: But there's enough that if you were laying down, you could try to shoot through it, I'll give you that.

[03:04:22] Speaker 5: Mm, mm.

[03:04:24] Speaker 2: Um, so at the end of the round, also the wagons move a little bit more 'cause the squigs have to keep up with you guys.

[03:04:29] Speaker 4: (sighs)

[03:04:31] Speaker 2: So you're moved to kind of like that now.

[03:04:33] Speaker 4: We wanted to be parallel.

[03:04:36] Speaker 2: And then so then who went after that?

[03:04:38] Speaker 1: Um, so after red squig, which-

[03:04:41] Speaker 2: Red squig went... Okay.

[03:04:42] Speaker 1: I don't-

[03:04:42] Speaker 4: He just went.

[03:04:43] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[03:04:44] Speaker 2: Um, he would've-

[03:04:44] Speaker 1: It's just so confusing.

[03:04:44] Speaker 2: He would've bounced.

[03:04:45] Speaker 4: He already did. He attacked Lynn and missed twice.

[03:04:47] Speaker 2: So we'll say he had to bounce up to him. They moved, then he bounced up and he missed Lynn.

[03:04:51] Speaker 1: Oh, both blue squigs are up? Damn.

[03:04:54] Speaker 2: Oh, blue's next?

[03:04:55] Speaker 1: No.

[03:04:55] Speaker 4: No.

[03:04:56] Speaker 1: I'm just surprised both blue squigs are up. I didn't see the other one.

[03:04:58] Speaker 2: Blue hasn't taken... I think one of the blues took.

[03:05:00] Speaker 4: He attacks two.

[03:05:01] Speaker 1: Aurelia is up next.

[03:05:04] Speaker 2: So you did fall and when you became unconscious, you did drop your, whatever weapon you were holding.

[03:05:07] Speaker 4: You don't have anything in your hand so you-

[03:05:08] Speaker 5: Do I see number one from where Lane?

[03:05:12] Speaker 2: Mm, I'd say him, no. If you're... He could easily see off the back and the sides, but...

[03:05:18] Speaker 5: Not number one?

[03:05:19] Speaker 4: Number one is off the back. She means blue one.

[03:05:21] Speaker 5: Oh.

[03:05:22] Speaker 2: The blue one, yeah.

[03:05:22] Speaker 5: Yeah.

[03:05:22] Speaker 4: She can't see that blue, red one exists.

[03:05:24] Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, you can see that... Yeah, you can definitely see. You have a clear shot on him.

[03:05:27] Speaker 5: Uh, if we're laying down, I'm gonna pick up my hand crossbow and I'm gonna shoot number one.

[03:05:32] Speaker 2: Yep, let's...

[03:05:34] Speaker 1: Goblin riders are on deck. Or rider. (laughs)

[03:05:39] Speaker 5: (laughs)

[03:05:43] Speaker 4: Credit where it's due.

[03:05:45] Speaker 5: 12.

[03:05:46] Speaker 2: Uh, 12 will miss because extra-

[03:05:49] Speaker 1: Combining biting bugs and electric arc-

[03:05:50] Speaker 2: It was a pricey range.

[03:05:51] Speaker 1: ... is great because-

[03:05:51] Speaker 2: High CC.

[03:05:52] Speaker 5: Okay, uh...

[03:05:52] Speaker 1: Multi-attack penalty doesn't apply.

[03:05:54] Speaker 5: Oh, I suppose it was an action to pick up my crossbow when I can.

[03:05:56] Speaker 1: I can get two spell attacks in.

[03:05:57] Speaker 2: One's a load, one to shoot if you want to reload.

[03:05:59] Speaker 5: Yeah, reload.

[03:06:00] Speaker 1: Which is normally quite hard to do for a-

[03:06:02] Speaker 5: Yep.

[03:06:03] Speaker 2: Um, so next up-

[03:06:04] Speaker 6: Because of action comedy.

[03:06:05] Speaker 7: Goes after me.

[03:06:06] Speaker 8: Goblin rider.

[03:06:07] Speaker 2: Goblin rider. Um, he has at least three targets he can go after. But probably not, uh, really 'cause you're on the ground. He's shooting, but he's more focused on the two that aren't, so even, odd. Even, so he's going after you. (dramatic music)

[03:06:25] Speaker 9: Yes.

[03:06:25] Speaker 2: It'll take him one action to get to there. Right up next to you, um, and then he'd have two attacks on you, uh, which takes with his little thing. That's gonna be a 24 to hit. No, minus one.

[03:06:37] Speaker 8: 23 still hits.

[03:06:38] Speaker 2: Yeah. For a whopping one point of damage.

[03:06:41] Speaker 8: Mother-fucker.

[03:06:44] Speaker 7: Only one point?

[03:06:45] Speaker 2: Well... Yeah, these have no plus to them.

[03:06:48] Speaker 8: So rude.

[03:06:48] Speaker 2: Um, so he's gonna take a second attack. They have crossbows, but they're not very accurate. You guys are moving, you're hard to hit, so, um.

[03:06:55] Speaker 8: Jesus, that's max damage.

[03:06:56] Speaker 2: That's gonna miss. Yeah, I get the... I- I've been getting the max damage on the misses.

[03:06:59] Speaker 8: I didn't see the 20/20, I just saw the-

[03:07:01] Speaker 2: And a little damage on the hit.

[03:07:02] Speaker 8: ... max damage die. (laughs)

[03:07:03] Speaker 2: Um, that would be a 16.

[03:07:04] Speaker 8: For level one.

[03:07:05] Speaker 2: 15 since he was riding.

[03:07:06] Speaker 8: Six out of D6 hurts.

[03:07:10] Speaker 2: That's it for him.

[03:07:11] Speaker 8: All right. I wanna change it. Uh, I said Bessie's name in my header, I want that to be Viernea and, um, I'm gonna make a check.

[03:07:19] Speaker 7: Your hammer's name Bessie?

[03:07:21] Speaker 8: No, it's now Viernea 'cause I'm retconning it.

[03:07:23] Speaker 7: Okay.

[03:07:26] Speaker 8: Uh, okay. That is very high. That is a 24.

[03:07:30] Speaker 2: That'll hit.

[03:07:31] Speaker 8: Okay. Um, so that is 11 bludgeoning and 3 spirit.

[03:07:37] Speaker 2: So, 14 all together?

[03:07:39] Speaker 8: Mm-hmm.

[03:07:40] Speaker 2: You take a great whop and they're both kinda wobbly now.

[03:07:44] Speaker 8: Mm, love it.

[03:07:45] Speaker 2: Uh, he was pretty good on.

[03:07:47] Speaker 8: Should have done this beforehand, but I will intimidate him, be like, "Oh, you don't want a piece of this, my friend."

[03:07:52] Speaker 2: (laughs) They appreciate the intimidation.

[03:07:56] Speaker 8: Um, that is only a 12.

[03:07:57] Speaker 2: Uh, that would... Well, see, that's Will.

[03:07:59] Speaker 8: Will DC, maybe he's got a plus two. (laughs)

[03:08:02] Speaker 2: (laughs) He has a plus three.

[03:08:04] Speaker 8: All right, second attack.

[03:08:06] Speaker 2: I mean, you would have needed a plus one.

[03:08:07] Speaker 8: Nat 20.

[03:08:08] Speaker 2: Oh, oh boy.

[03:08:09] Speaker 8: On that... What is that? Attack?

[03:08:11] Speaker 2: Yeah, on the attack.

[03:08:12] Speaker 8: Nice. Well, now he's dead.

[03:08:13] Speaker 2: Yeah. (laughs)

[03:08:14] Speaker 8: Um, six-

[03:08:17] Speaker 2: Thanks.

[03:08:17] Speaker 8: ... uh, 22 bludgeoning and 6 spirit.

[03:08:20] Speaker 2: Okay, so basically you see him go splat. And as you guys drive away, you just see this, you know, splatted guy getting further and further away.

[03:08:28] Speaker 8: (laughs) And that is my turn. Um, next is blue.

[03:08:36] Speaker 2: Blue, they are gonna continue hopping up. Um, so this one's going after one of you two.

[03:08:41] Speaker 8: Kotal is on deck.

[03:08:43] Speaker 2: We're gonna do even, odd. Odd. Every one I roll randomly, it always goes after you. I'm gonna actually put it in between both of you guys there because you just-

[03:08:53] Speaker 8: Yeah, it's fine. Barbarian's meant to take damage.

[03:08:55] Speaker 2: I might even say it takes him two actions to get there, but he's gonna go there and take a chomp at you. Miss horribly on a ten, uh, it's like a 10 which equals a nine. Other guy, you're laying down, which makes you harder to hit. So I'm gonna say it's one of the other three. Gonna go after her.

[03:09:20] Speaker 9: (laughs)

[03:09:20] Speaker 2: He hops up to the front of the car.

[03:09:23] Speaker 9: I need to get some Mountain Dew on my way home. (laughs) I gotta stay awake for another seven hours. (laughs)

[03:09:28] Speaker 2: Oh.

[03:09:29] Speaker 9: I can take a nap. I'll probably will go home and take a 90-minute nap and then wake up.

[03:09:33] Speaker 7: He has to do another, like, night climb thing?

[03:09:36] Speaker 8: Yeah.

[03:09:37] Speaker 2: Probably sucks-

[03:09:38] Speaker 9: It's the second one is the last one.

[03:09:39] Speaker 2: All the way across town it's the-

[03:09:40] Speaker 9: There's a big party in two weeks-

[03:09:42] Speaker 2: Oh, is there?

[03:09:42] Speaker 9: ... because of it.

[03:09:42] Speaker 8: Oh yeah, no more chart sink. That's huge.

[03:09:45] Speaker 2: Um, he would miss her 'cause that's not... Um, next up.

[03:09:49] Speaker 10: Oh, sorry, um-

[03:09:52] Speaker 6: Flurry on the-

[03:09:52] Speaker 10: I think I said... Yeah.

[03:09:53] Speaker 6: ... blue two.

[03:09:53] Speaker 8: Kotal.

[03:09:55] Speaker 6: Uh, those are probably both end of the round.

[03:09:57] Speaker 8: The end of the rounds?

[03:09:58] Speaker 6: Unless the, the... No, their AC has to be better than that. Uh-

[03:10:02] Speaker 2: These things have a surprisingly... Well, you guys don't know they're called Squigs since no one's identified them yet, but, uh, second action is... Or third... Second action is just a, a wish and a prayer. Nope, uh, sorry, for the third.

[03:10:16] Speaker 8: Oh, okay. Next, it's the end of the round.

[03:10:19] Speaker 2: End of the round, so basically, yeah, you guys move a bit further. You are noticing that, um, there's not as many goblins.

[03:10:26] Speaker 8: The ambush is thinning out?

[03:10:28] Speaker 2: Yeah, if it's thinning out, you're probably coming to the end of it, you think?

[03:10:32] Speaker 8: Uh, Onarra is on deck once this...

[03:10:34] Speaker 2: Okay, that's it for them. So, uh, the two MPCs would go, um, let's see, they're both ready and attack. The Squig gets next to them. Um, then up next then, um, Onarra.

[03:10:51] Speaker 6: All right, Onarra will...

[03:10:54] Speaker 8: Run as on deck.

[03:10:55] Speaker 6: Let's see, what's still in range? Five, 10, 15, 20, 25. Okay, so both of these two are still in range.

[03:11:05] Speaker 2: (laughs) They're getting arced.

[03:11:06] Speaker 10: Uh, well, no, uh, are either of those two damaged already?

[03:11:11] Speaker 2: Uh, let's see, red one and blue.

[03:11:15] Speaker 6: Didn't one take electric arc?

[03:11:17] Speaker 2: Um, blue two I think was when it took the electric arc.

[03:11:20] Speaker 6: Okay.

[03:11:21] Speaker 2: Okay.

[03:11:22] Speaker 6: Well-

[03:11:22] Speaker 2: Blue two's on twen- or no, red one has taken damage, blue two has taken damage.

[03:11:29] Speaker 8: Okay.

[03:11:30] Speaker 2: So red, blue.

[03:11:31] Speaker 8: So, red-

[03:11:32] Speaker 2: Who has not.

[03:11:32] Speaker 8: Red one, we're gonna target with, um, biting words, use my last use of that. So, uh, uh, ugh. Eh, 11. I'm just gonna-

[03:11:45] Speaker 2: One.

[03:11:45] Speaker 8: Doesn't hit. All right, so biting words is over, uh, and then now, yes, both of them are getting targeted with electric arc, so DC15 reflex save.

[03:11:56] Speaker 2: Okay, so red gets a 20.

[03:12:00] Speaker 8: Uh, passes.

[03:12:00] Speaker 2: So just a regular pass. Blue-It's a 22, so that's probably just a regular pass.

[03:12:06] Speaker 11: Yep. All right. So it's-

[03:12:07] Speaker 12: What the hell are people doing at 10:00 on a Friday night?

[03:12:09] Speaker 11: So two regular passes. And four damage. So two is, two is what they'll take.

[03:12:16] Speaker 2: I say they have a high armor... They have a surprisingly high armor class. It's pretty good, so...

[03:12:21] Speaker 11: That was a reflex saving throw.

[03:12:22] Speaker 12: But if you're working at 9:00 on a Friday night, I'm gonna-

[03:12:23] Speaker 11: All right. Well, I did my best. (laughs)

[03:12:25] Speaker 12: ... slow 'em down.

[03:12:25] Speaker 13: (laughs)

[03:12:26] Speaker 14: That's very good, Amy.

[03:12:27] Speaker 12: Woo, my friend.

[03:12:29] Speaker 14: (laughs)

[03:12:29] Speaker 2: Okay. Next up-

[03:12:30] Speaker 13: I have not enjoyed waiting for late-night approvals. Um, next up is Squid Red.

[03:12:35] Speaker 2: Squid Red, um, Red-

[03:12:37] Speaker 13: Aurelia's on deck.

[03:12:38] Speaker 2: He is in a, he has eight people.

[03:12:40] Speaker 15: Oh, thank you. That helps.

[03:12:41] Speaker 2: Welcome. Um, so one, two, three, four, five... Oh yeah, there's one more. Six of you guys, not eight. Six. He likes you, gonna jump right between the carts there.

[03:12:57] Speaker 13: Is she still prone?

[03:12:58] Speaker 2: Yeah, she is prone.

[03:12:59] Speaker 12: She has a gun now.

[03:13:00] Speaker 2: But-

[03:13:00] Speaker 12: She's laying down, like (punching noises).

[03:13:03] Speaker 15: Yeah, I do that.

[03:13:03] Speaker 2: He can see her doing things.

[03:13:04] Speaker 13: With her laser gun.

[03:13:05] Speaker 2: They're not smart but-

[03:13:06] Speaker 12: I mean crossbow.

[03:13:06] Speaker 13: Mm-hmm.

[03:13:07] Speaker 2: Um, but he's gonna take a chomp at you if he is-

[03:13:09] Speaker 13: Maybe your laser gun.

[03:13:10] Speaker 14: I just was hoping that there would be more of a penalty to try and attack as much as we-

[03:13:15] Speaker 2: Um-

[03:13:15] Speaker 12: There is.

[03:13:16] Speaker 14: (laughs)

[03:13:17] Speaker 12: Well, melee attack on somebody who's prone is easier.

[03:13:20] Speaker 2: Yeah, there's a-

[03:13:21] Speaker 12: 'Cause she's off, she's off balance basically.

[03:13:22] Speaker 13: Mm-hmm.

[03:13:23] Speaker 2: Yeah, but she's-

[03:13:23] Speaker 13: But it's in a cart with walls and stuff.

[03:13:25] Speaker 15: And cover.

[03:13:26] Speaker 12: Yeah, well there is, you said there's a minus one on everything here, right?

[03:13:29] Speaker 2: Yeah, but he rolled a 19 on the die.

[03:13:30] Speaker 13: Oh, fuck this. Nevermind.

[03:13:32] Speaker 15: Yeah, 19 still hits.

[03:13:33] Speaker 2: So it is-

[03:13:35] Speaker 13: Well, 19 on the die is maybe appropriate.

[03:13:36] Speaker 12: There's only 23 points of damage, don't worry.

[03:13:40] Speaker 2: Uh, he would deal six points.

[03:13:42] Speaker 15: Yay, I'm unconscious again.

[03:13:44] Speaker 12: Congratulations, you're dying too.

[03:13:45] Speaker 13: Hey, you're not on deck. Oh, the goblin rider is dead, right?

[03:13:50] Speaker 2: Um, he, he has one action left. He's gonna take an attack on, he has three people kind of in range of him there, 'cause he's kinda in between your two carts.

[03:13:57] Speaker 12: What? There's a goblin rider left? Oh, no.

[03:14:00] Speaker 13: No, he's right there.

[03:14:00] Speaker 2: He's by the other little-

[03:14:00] Speaker 13: So technically he can do whatever you two are, attack you. Actually, you haven't been attacked yet. He's gonna go right down the line and go after you.

[03:14:06] Speaker 15: Angry.

[03:14:07] Speaker 2: It's the mat penalty and he will miss.

[03:14:09] Speaker 13: Spreading some damage. Right, uh, next is me. I'm gonna swing away. Uh, that is a three. I got a hero point, why not?

[03:14:19] Speaker 2: (laughs)

[03:14:21] Speaker 13: Not trusting you. Uh, does a 17 hit?

[03:14:28] Speaker 11: That's good.

[03:14:28] Speaker 2: Uh, that we'll say yes.

[03:14:30] Speaker 13: Check. Oh yeah, it should've been 16 with the minus one.

[03:14:33] Speaker 2: Um, I'm gonna say yes just since we're trying to wrap these up. These guys have a surprisingly high AC.

[03:14:41] Speaker 13: And so that is 10 bludgeoning and three spirit.

[03:14:45] Speaker 2: Okay, that's enough to splatter him.

[03:14:46] Speaker 13: Okay, um...

[03:14:48] Speaker 15: Squish.

[03:14:49] Speaker 13: Second action. Aim true, Plia. Um, so that is a, I guess, one action for him to jab one and then third action to throw it, uh, 15 to hit.

[03:15:07] Speaker 2: That would miss.

[03:15:08] Speaker 13: Okay.

[03:15:09] Speaker 2: Plia, come on.

[03:15:11] Speaker 13: And that is my turn.

[03:15:12] Speaker 2: Oh. Next up.

[03:15:14] Speaker 13: Uh, next up is Squid Blue.

[03:15:18] Speaker 2: Oh. Um, he'll hop up. I'm gonna say he triggers two attacks of opportunity they had waiting, and we'll just say they bludgeon him to smoosh.

[03:15:28] Speaker 13: Smooshy.

[03:15:30] Speaker 12: Other one. Bluetooth, still there?

[03:15:33] Speaker 2: Oh, yeah. He's there.

[03:15:34] Speaker 13: Kotal's on deck.

[03:15:34] Speaker 2: He'll pop in between two of you guys.

[03:15:37] Speaker 12: Bring it. I haven't been attacked.

[03:15:40] Speaker 2: Yeah, he'll do that, and we haven't had a chance for you to use your parry yet.

[03:15:42] Speaker 15: They like me. Why do they like me?

[03:15:44] Speaker 12: Parry just increases my AC by one.

[03:15:45] Speaker 13: You put yourself in the path.

[03:15:45] Speaker 11: It's not actually, uh, right near where they could get to you easiest while they were following us.

[03:15:50] Speaker 2: Oh, that'd be 19.

[03:15:51] Speaker 12: (laughs) Parry, no.

[03:15:53] Speaker 2: (laughs)

[03:15:53] Speaker 12: My AC 20 with parry.

[03:15:56] Speaker 11: Nice.

[03:15:57] Speaker 2: He looks disappointed.

[03:15:58] Speaker 11: Real good.

[03:15:58] Speaker 2: And we'll say that's his turn. Go ahead.

[03:16:01] Speaker 13: Oh, when, uh, Aurelia went down, I got a bunch of glory so I got, I sure got some HPs.

[03:16:06] Speaker 12: 20.

[03:16:06] Speaker 2: What's that?

[03:16:06] Speaker 12: 20.

[03:16:07] Speaker 2: That hits.

[03:16:09] Speaker 12: That is, oh, sadly only five damage.

[03:16:12] Speaker 2: (laughs)

[03:16:14] Speaker 12: And we'll give him one more for good measure 'cause there's a crit on every die. No. Well, that's a 14 with the minus three.

[03:16:24] Speaker 2: Yeah, I would say no.

[03:16:25] Speaker 12: For the third attack. (laughs)

[03:16:28] Speaker 13: Uh, Goblin end of the round.

[03:16:30] Speaker 12: Only one's left.

[03:16:31] Speaker 2: End of the round? So basically now at the end of the round you guys continue on, the goblins pass away.

[03:16:35] Speaker 12: We get away.

[03:16:35] Speaker 2: He, um, starts falling behind wistfully.

[03:16:37] Speaker 12: 'Cause he's not gonna make it to his friends.

[03:16:39] Speaker 2: But, uh, he'll give up in time 'cause he lost his friends.

[03:16:42] Speaker 12: Is she stable?

[03:16:44] Speaker 2: Um, Lynn would go back and stabilize you.

[03:16:46] Speaker 13: Okay.

[03:16:46] Speaker 2: And eventually, yeah, you, you'll wake up a few minutes later down the road. So you guys have passed the goblin ambush. You continue on for the remainder of the, uh, day, and overnight you guys get another chance to rest up and heal and whatnot. Um, basically you guys travel on for another few days. Um, again it takes, uh, the whole trek is like, uh, you know, two or three week process. But after a few more harrowing days, um-

[03:17:09] Speaker 13: It's a long rest.

[03:17:10] Speaker 2: Uh, yeah, a long rest, you guys are all good. Um, you, you make your way to Tigrum's Cross and you eventually come through a clearing. You see a mighty wide river, um, and this is almost like maybe the size of the Missouri in certain places here in Wisconsin.

[03:17:24] Speaker 13: Oh.

[03:17:24] Speaker 15: Oh.

[03:17:25] Speaker 2: So it's a, it's not like the Mississippi that's miles wide, but it's, it's fairly wide. Um-

[03:17:29] Speaker 12: Mississippi's never miles wide.

[03:17:30] Speaker 13: Yeah. (laughs)

[03:17:31] Speaker 12: (laughs)

[03:17:32] Speaker 2: People say it is, I haven't-

[03:17:33] Speaker 13: It's not.

[03:17:34] Speaker 12: ... reached over-

[03:17:34] Speaker 13: It's never a mile wide.

[03:17:35] Speaker 12: It might be 1,000 feet wide-

[03:17:37] Speaker 13: There you go.

[03:17:37] Speaker 12: ... but it is not 10,000 feet wide.

[03:17:39] Speaker 13: Yeah.

[03:17:40] Speaker 2: But this is at least like the Missi- Missouri size where, um-

[03:17:44] Speaker 12: Big river.

[03:17:45] Speaker 13: Big, big.

[03:17:45] Speaker 2: ... you see a massive... You see a massive bridge over it, you see a few buildings on the bridge, um-

[03:17:49] Speaker 12: A bridge on it, you say? Have we ever seen an incredible bridge miniature that was printed? (laughs)

[03:17:55] Speaker 13: (laughs)

[03:17:55] Speaker 2: Mm, some of you may have. I don't bring it down and set it up 'cause that'll take some time to draw up, but who knows? You guys come next week, there might be a bridge set up. So yeah, you guys have reached there. Now basically I'll point out, you guys have met two of the, um, I didn't cover this yet, but you've met two of the, um-Non-NPCs are the same. So we have Dramatis Personae. If you've read the, part of the rules, and again I don't know if everyone did, about Dramatis Personae, um-

[03:18:20] Speaker 16: Make friends with people.

[03:18:21] Speaker 2: Yep, you guys can make friends with them. They are... I wanted this... So there's gonna be a select number, and once you guys have been introduced to all of them, that's when you hit level two. So, might be a, a session or two down the road. But, um-

[03:18:31] Speaker 17: Which two are those? Is that... Is one of those the old guy?

[03:18:34] Speaker 2: Yep.

[03:18:34] Speaker 17: Yeah, okay.

[03:18:35] Speaker 16: That's Glenn.

[03:18:35] Speaker 2: So, Dramatis Personae, so a little bit about them.

[03:18:37] Speaker 17: Who?

[03:18:37] Speaker 2: Um, starting when you guys get to level, I think three, you can start trying to become friends with them.

[03:18:42] Speaker 17: Yeah.

[03:18:42] Speaker 2: You're gonna earn coins, and you can spend the coins on a lot of different things. I'll kind of explain that, but once you become a friend with one, I'll give you, uh, um... You get a special c- coin where you can spend that to then earn... You have to have one of the, one of your NPCs, but they can teach you a few different, uh, traits. Um, but these guys, so I wanted it to be so that as far as, like, finding NPCs, you don't have to remember a laundry list of NPCs. There will be minor Dramatis Personae, but as far as the major ones, there will be a set number. And so there will be maybe kind of points you get to in the plot where they, uh, um, will, uh, know things. Like I don't care what you roll on your knowledge check, you might have to investigate and do some investigation. So chances are they can either tell you or they can lead you in that direction. There's chances you're gonna have where you can learn a new skill or a new language. And if it would be if you befriended one of the, uh, uh, Dramatis Personae, they can teach you that. Um, so we'll get into that a little bit more as you get there. But there are gonna be chances to do that. They may even be able to do things for you if you're, um, interested. If you... You can be friends with any number of the Dramatis Personae, but you can raise it at certain points, you know, like a good friend or a best friend, like a really good, you know, higher levels. Um, you can only have one Dramatis Persona that you get to, like, a good or best friend type status. But as you do that, there's also like a lot more lore that will happen. There's also... You may get new quests by talking to them. So there's gonna be a set number, a few more than there are in the party. I won't tell you the exact number, but more than five. Um, but, you know, they're the ones that are, will be, like I said, a lot of the stuff you can, kind of fun stuff. You know, as we play along a bit further you'll get to know that. But you have so far met two of them.

[03:20:25] Speaker 18: Okay. Sounds good.

[03:20:25] Speaker 17: Cool.

[03:20:25] Speaker 16: One of them seems like he wants to be my best friend.

[03:20:28] Speaker 17: Hmm.

[03:20:28] Speaker 2: He does. I will point out, some of them will have some-

[03:20:31] Speaker 19: I get that vibes too.

[03:20:32] Speaker 2: Some of them will have some similarities to some of your guys, but you don't necessarily have to choose them.

[03:20:36] Speaker 18: Uh, sometimes opposites attract. (dice shuffling)

[03:20:38] Speaker 2: If you do have NPCs, like-

[03:20:39] Speaker 19: Sometimes they do.

[03:20:40] Speaker 2: Again, you can be friends with any number of the Dramatis Personae. (ding) You can try and get to that level.

[03:20:43] Speaker 19: Oh.

[03:20:43] Speaker 2: But if you really want to get to the best friend status, you can pick any you want to. It doesn't have to-

[03:20:47] Speaker 19: I'm gonna guess I'm not dying too, anymore, right?

[03:20:49] Speaker 2: No, no.

[03:20:49] Speaker 17: No, you are-

[03:20:49] Speaker 2: Good to go. But at the end-

[03:20:51] Speaker 17: Stabilized and I'm healed, so even wounded it probably goes away.

[03:20:53] Speaker 2: So remember this for next week. Um, he'll give you guys all 10 gold for your wonderful duties here, um-

[03:20:58] Speaker 19: 10 gold? Woo!

[03:20:59] Speaker 2: ... when you get to the bridge. But remember that market in there next week, if anyone does want to be the treasurer, we'll hand out the coin. Otherwise I'll do it. Um, and we'll start playing with the coin at that point.

[03:21:08] Speaker 17: Should we not even bother to add 10 gold to our-

[03:21:10] Speaker 2: You can add gold.

[03:21:11] Speaker 17: ... cash register, or-

[03:21:11] Speaker 2: Yeah, add 10 into it, um-

[03:21:12] Speaker 17: Okay.

[03:21:12] Speaker 2: ... if you'll do that now, I'll just weigh it out and then give you the totals next week and I'll... (dice shuffling) We'll hand out coins.

[03:21:19] Speaker 17: Good. I need to replace the javelin. Also I'm gonna heal this kid.

[03:21:23] Speaker 19: I thought you picked up the javelin you threw?

[03:21:25] Speaker 2: Oh, no, he chucked it at Squig. (hand slapping)

[03:21:26] Speaker 18: I just threw it on during the lagging.

[03:21:28] Speaker 20: Oh, okay.

[03:21:30] Speaker 19: They were called Squigs?

[03:21:32] Speaker 2: Yeah.

[03:21:32] Speaker 17: All right, are we done?

[03:21:33] Speaker 18: We need to get Chuck a javelin and return it.

[03:21:34] Speaker 2: Yep, we're all set for tonight.

[03:21:35] Speaker 17: All right, I'm stopping the recording. All right.

[03:21:38] Speaker 16: Yeah, them all had one of those. They're handy.

[03:21:41] Speaker 2: I'll try to play around the week. Like I said, I think it's the-

[03:21:43] Speaker 17: Yeah.

[03:21:43] Speaker 2: ... Apple connection doesn't work.

[03:21:44] Speaker 17: No, I want to try something else.

[03:21:45] Speaker 2: Oh.

[03:21:46] Speaker 17: Hold on. Stop this.
