[00:00:00] Speaker 1: Let's put Canadian on there too. (dramatic music)

[00:00:04] Speaker 2: All right, so...

[00:00:08] Speaker 1: So you guys have just arrived. Um, as you guys were arriving, you saw this, kind of as you're entering in, kind of was a hill looking down. You see a long flowing river, um. Oh, yeah, stuff. That's all right.

[00:00:22] Speaker 2: That's in here.

[00:00:24] Speaker 1: North, south, so we're going by the dice here eventually. So-

[00:00:29] Speaker 3: Yeah, I'm gonna do it real quick just so we don't die.

[00:00:31] Speaker 1: Let's see, north would be that way. South is coming up my direction. Is that too loud also or for the audio?

[00:00:38] Speaker 2: Probably a little bit.

[00:00:40] Speaker 3: Can you pull it down a little bit?

[00:00:41] Speaker 2: I mean, it's pretty smart but there are some parts in the transcript last week where it was like dramatic music. (laughs)

[00:00:48] Speaker 3: (laughs)

[00:00:48] Speaker 2: In parenthesis, it wasn't intentional, like it's not like it was a particularly dramatic moment.

[00:00:53] Speaker 3: Yeah, I was gonna ask did-

[00:00:54] Speaker 2: It just heard music-

[00:00:55] Speaker 3: ... you mean certain dramatic types?

[00:00:55] Speaker 2: ... all of the sudden where it was just...

[00:00:57] Speaker 4: That's actually funny.

[00:00:59] Speaker 2: It does a good... It like, the El- Eleven Labs AI API does a good job of characterizing other noises like sometimes it's like dices rolling, no- you know, in parenthesis, or laughing, or groans. (laughs)

[00:01:12] Speaker 4: That's kind of good. That's funny.

[00:01:14] Speaker 1: Oh.

[00:01:16] Speaker 2: The transcript quality is far better than it was before.

[00:01:20] Speaker 3: Sorry.

[00:01:20] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[00:01:21] Speaker 2: The thing that-

[00:01:21] Speaker 3: The thing that impresses me the most is the, uh, how it automatically creates a Wiki of all the characters and stuff that you come across on its own.

[00:01:28] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[00:01:29] Speaker 3: Wow. That's pretty handy.

[00:01:31] Speaker 1: Anyway, oh, which if you guys want to roll a D10?

[00:01:33] Speaker 4: Actually, it's not accurate, is it?

[00:01:34] Speaker 2: Uh, yes.

[00:01:35] Speaker 4: Is that including me?

[00:01:36] Speaker 1: Uh, yeah. Let me find something.

[00:01:39] Speaker 2: June, August.

[00:01:41] Speaker 4: Seven.

[00:01:41] Speaker 3: What's my name again?

[00:01:42] Speaker 4: Nine.

[00:01:43] Speaker 1: July. And if one of you-

[00:01:44] Speaker 2: Tom.

[00:01:44] Speaker 1: ... wants to add them together real quick.

[00:01:46] Speaker 4: You got a 10?

[00:01:47] Speaker 2: 10.

[00:01:47] Speaker 1: Cool.

[00:01:47] Speaker 4: You got a seven? Seven.

[00:01:49] Speaker 3: 17.

[00:01:49] Speaker 4: 26.

[00:01:50] Speaker 2: 26.

[00:01:50] Speaker 1: So starting on the... So 26 altogether?

[00:01:53] Speaker 4: Yep.

[00:01:55] Speaker 1: 15. 15 plus 26. Uh. 21 days, right there. And we're now in two.

[00:02:11] Speaker 2: Oh, did everybody get their character converted?

[00:02:14] Speaker 4: Uh, mine's still on the other one. Greg said there's some way to do it, so I was gonna wait.

[00:02:18] Speaker 1: I think yours... Uh, I saw yours in there.

[00:02:20] Speaker 4: I created it but there's nothing in it.

[00:02:21] Speaker 1: Oh, um, here, I can show you real quick. That's all you have to do.

[00:02:23] Speaker 4: I mean, I can just use it on the other one if it works for tonight and then transfer it over after you show us how.

[00:02:29] Speaker 1: Um, it's actually... Here, I think I did the wrong-

[00:02:31] Speaker 4: I think I just figured out how to do it, so mine's in now.

[00:02:33] Speaker 2: Mine's in there.

[00:02:34] Speaker 1: Characters. Well, yeah, if you go to your characters, you have your campaign characters up here, and down below you have your regular characters. All you have to do is go to your campaign character, click the three dots, or, click the three dots? You just go copy outside campaign.

[00:02:47] Speaker 4: Mm-hmm.

[00:02:48] Speaker 3: Oh.

[00:02:48] Speaker 1: And then once you've done that, it'll copy your character to this section then you just go...

[00:02:52] Speaker 2: You go under the new campaign.

[00:02:53] Speaker 1: Put your characters there and you go, you can do, I think export/integrate.

[00:02:57] Speaker 4: There's also an introduce to-

[00:02:58] Speaker 3: No.

[00:02:58] Speaker 4: Yeah, introduce to campaign, yeah.

[00:02:59] Speaker 3: Introduce to campaign.

[00:03:00] Speaker 4: Oh, okay.

[00:03:00] Speaker 3: That's the right one.

[00:03:00] Speaker 1: So.

[00:03:01] Speaker 2: It's just a couple clicks, but you might need to delete the empty one you created and you can't delete it, you'll probably just have to-

[00:03:06] Speaker 1: Oh, retry or what I think, yeah.

[00:03:08] Speaker 2: ... abandon it or something?

[00:03:08] Speaker 1: Yeah, do that if you need to, otherwise, write me if you need it tonight so I can fix it.

[00:03:12] Speaker 4: Okay. Yeah.

[00:03:14] Speaker 1: Um, okay, then we can go here. So-

[00:03:16] Speaker 2: So starting on the 26th, is that a date? You have a calendar in front of you.

[00:03:19] Speaker 1: I made up a calendar.

[00:03:21] Speaker 4: Ah. Do you want by-

[00:03:24] Speaker 2: Are they... Because like are they weeks or are they ten days?

[00:03:26] Speaker 1: Uh, they're weeks.

[00:03:26] Speaker 4: You know my weather, my weather generation checklist? (laughs)

[00:03:30] Speaker 1: Oh. Well, so you guys had originally had started in the month Astra Helios, um, uh, which is the equivalent of July. Um, Helios, you guys, anyone sound familiar?

[00:03:42] Speaker 3: Uh, sun.

[00:03:42] Speaker 1: Guys remember the deities that-

[00:03:44] Speaker 4: Like Leo?

[00:03:44] Speaker 1: Helios is the deity of-

[00:03:46] Speaker 3: The sun, hopefully.

[00:03:47] Speaker 1: ... one of the natural deities of, yeah, the sun.

[00:03:49] Speaker 3: 'Cause otherwise (laughs) it's badly named. (laughs)

[00:03:52] Speaker 1: Um, but he's also, um, kind of a, um, uh, patron male figure. So he's also, um, fatherhood, he's also a certain degree manliness, um, kind of stuff like that. He's, he's, um, also in some of the religions he's like, um, Sol Invictus if you're from the, um...

[00:04:12] Speaker 4: I thought that was Stendarr.

[00:04:14] Speaker 1: What's that?

[00:04:14] Speaker 4: I thought that was Stendarr.

[00:04:16] Speaker 1: No, Stendarr is a little bit of a different one.

[00:04:18] Speaker 4: Oh.

[00:04:18] Speaker 1: But you are now entering, you began in the month of Astra Helios. Um, I'm gonna put that probably it took you guys about a week or two to get here, so give me just a second here. So 15, 31, 21 you are... You said 26?

[00:04:34] Speaker 2: 26.

[00:04:35] Speaker 4: Mm-hmm. The tops will always come off, right?

[00:04:37] Speaker 1: Oh, yeah. Yeah, they're pretty tight inside there.

[00:04:40] Speaker 4: Yeah, I figured.

[00:04:41] Speaker 1: Um...

[00:04:41] Speaker 4: I was just curious.

[00:04:44] Speaker 2: This is, by the way, fucking impressive.

[00:04:47] Speaker 4: I know.

[00:04:47] Speaker 3: Mm-hmm.

[00:04:48] Speaker 1: Yeah. Think so many, um, 113. You guys probably started, we're gonna say, you began in the 24th of Astra Helios. You're now in Astra Stendarr. Um, uh, and you are on the 6th, which is a Thursday. So I'm using this to track a number of things, but, uh... Put that right there. So you guys had just arrived the night before. Um, as you come in, you had seen this bridge with a few buildings on it. Um-

[00:05:25] Speaker 4: Oh, yeah.

[00:05:25] Speaker 1: It takes a while for the wagon train to come here. Basically, as the wagon trains come in... Now this is not to s- to scale. I mean, it would actually be a little bit bigger than this, um, especially the buildings. If you open these things up, you're barely gonna be able to put anything inside, so the bigger-

[00:05:39] Speaker 2: Like half scale also?

[00:05:40] Speaker 1: Also-

[00:05:40] Speaker 2: Conceptually, like?

[00:05:41] Speaker 1: This initially is a 28 millimeter bridge and you can... A lot of this is scaled more to 32, like a lot of the measures are. But you'll notice you can't fit wagons underneath the, uh, openings. So these are actually, the openings are much larger, you can accommodate a wagon, um, through these things. And the housing on top's a little bit bigger too. Um, also I'll point out on the edges here.

[00:06:01] Speaker 3: The canyon.

[00:06:02] Speaker 1: Um, on the sides, the gravel does come out a ways. Otherwise, on that side there's a-

[00:06:07] Speaker 5: ... door over water ￼because-

[00:06:08] Speaker 6: Mm, it gets theater of the mind a little, little bit.

[00:06:10] Speaker 1: Yeah. It's so, so, so just be aware it's a little theater as far as it goes. Um, so as the wagons come in they start pulling forward. Um, there's enough room for two wagons and there's enough room kind of in the center to get, uh, like to run a horse through. So what they usually do is they'll park a wagon. They'll run the horses on this side off to the side over there. There's kind of a penned off area where they can put the horses. Though you'll notice there's nothing on that side of there, so-

[00:06:32] Speaker 6: No, there's nothing at all.

[00:06:33] Speaker 7: This is crazy.

[00:06:35] Speaker 1: Um, I took some photos and it looks kind of small from the ones I have.

[00:06:38] Speaker 6: I reckon by building this shit for real, it looks amazing.

[00:06:41] Speaker 1: What I actually want to do is-

[00:06:42] Speaker 6: These last couple years, so.

[00:06:43] Speaker 7: I know.

[00:06:43] Speaker 1: ... I'm gonna go plug this into AI once I take the photos and say, "Can you make this into a-"

[00:06:47] Speaker 7: Oh, it'll make... If you just take a picture of it and say, "Make a cartoon drawing."

[00:06:50] Speaker 6: Yeah.

[00:06:50] Speaker 1: And actually make, um, make this into a photo. Yeah.

[00:06:51] Speaker 7: Yeah, it'll do it brilliantly.

[00:06:52] Speaker 1: A water painting or something like that. Um, at any rate, so but that's what they're doing, is they, they pull off... You have all the empty wagons here. They're pulling off with horses over there. So by the time you guys, you guys are at the end of the wagon train, it takes a little while before you guys get here and it's actually well into the evening at that point. Um, you get a very basic, uh, introduction. Um, they kind of just run you through.

[00:07:15] Speaker 8: (coughs)

[00:07:15] Speaker 1: Um, the wagons are all parked there. Now, on the front entrances by the way, there is a little guard outpost and a rudimentary gate, um, on both sides. Uh, you guys are brought up top and they basically say, you know, the, the foreman, the captain, um, he's you know, awfully busy right now. Come see him tomorrow. Go ahead in, get yourself some food real quick. One of the guards, I mean-

[00:07:38] Speaker 7: Who's they?

[00:07:39] Speaker 1: They, I should say the guards who are running this place, who are not posted-

[00:07:42] Speaker 7: So are we... Are we... Just trying to-

[00:07:45] Speaker 1: Go ahead.

[00:07:45] Speaker 7: ...understand our r-r-role here. We are no longer like attached to the caravan as employees, and now we're just w- interacting with the t- the town or the-

[00:07:55] Speaker 1: Yeah. Um, so-

[00:07:55] Speaker 7: ... settlement?

[00:07:56] Speaker 1: The wagon is all pulled in here. The wagon train is pulled in here. They're kind of resting up for the night. Um, this is about the time the, uh, leader of the caravan would've come and given you guys the gold-

[00:08:04] Speaker 7: Yeah.

[00:08:05] Speaker 1: ...the offered you 10 for doing that. Your service out here would officially ended. Um-

[00:08:09] Speaker 7: So now we're freelancers again.

[00:08:11] Speaker 1: You're... Yeah, you're freelancers again.

[00:08:12] Speaker 6: Oh.

[00:08:13] Speaker 1: Um, and he's offered, um, one of the guards who's here, um, I do have, uh, some... I can show you kind of what they look like if I don't manage to destroy the images.

[00:08:26] Speaker 6: So you're the dwarf in the picture I saw, huh?

[00:08:28] Speaker 9: Yeah. Yeah, I think I don't have to keep that secret anymore. (laughs) Can I actually see this?

[00:08:32] Speaker 1: And by the way, the, um... If you're curious about the, uh-

[00:08:35] Speaker 6: Okay.

[00:08:35] Speaker 1: ... MPCs, they'll be up there too.

[00:08:37] Speaker 6: There was just a little bit of glare. I couldn't see.

[00:08:39] Speaker 1: Okay.... um, posted, so.

[00:08:41] Speaker 6: I made... Oh, I can't say. Never mind. (laughs)

[00:08:44] Speaker 1: Um, put a few of the guards up, you get a feel for what they look like. The one you talked to specifically. (footsteps) Well, we'll just, you talk to the guards for now. You might not get a chance to talk to any other folks but, uh, they have a very, a feel for kind of like looking like this. There's a few dwarves that are guides too. Mostly they're... The dwarves you see that are guards are... Let's get a few over here too. Um, they're highland dwarves, um, the ones that you come across here. And they tell you, um... Gonna be so happy once I get a few sessions in because then I'll have everything figured out. I won't have to spend so much... I honestly thought I'd have some, some spare time once I got done with work.

[00:09:37] Speaker 6: (laughs)

[00:09:38] Speaker 1: It's like, "No, I gotta print this. No, I gotta print that." And I hadn't printed Ken's photo, I hadn't done a few other things, hadn't printed the calendar. So now that's all done, so-

[00:09:43] Speaker 6: Always the last second stuff, yep.

[00:09:46] Speaker 1: Ugh, feels like all last night too. So at any rate, I, I didn't... So the, some of the guards that got mail they just mentioned to you guys, um, they've had a long day themselves. It's not just the caravan coming. The, um... It turns out that, as you guys recall, they had a vanguard that had come here. Um, and the vanguard had arrived here earlier in the day. Um, their job being done, they settled into the local eating area and started drinking a little too much. And as you may recall, they were a rather surly bunch to begin with. So naturally that didn't go over too well once they got a few, a bit of ale in them. Caused some trouble, so it's been a long day for a lot of the guards and people here. Um, and the head captain is busy dealing with a bunch of other, you know, messes and stuff right now as much as ￼with you. Um, they take you in, they give you a... One of the guards give you a brief overview. Um, this building over here with the smokestack, um, this is... The upper parts are basically lodging. The bottom one is kind of a general store to a certain degree, but it's more general store in dealing with, um, usually wagons, um, is the best way to put it. Anything tied to caravan, like wagon needs, wagon wheels, hammers, woodworking instruments, et cetera, mostly for taking care of the wagons. And then the top part here, um, nothing to see inside really, but this top part is... Man, that was dumb. Oh, so I have to put it back on.

[00:11:17] Speaker 6: (laughs)

[00:11:18] Speaker 1: Um, the top part here is kind of nicer lodging for some of the caravan people who are a little more wealthy. Um, and then this very top part is basically hostel. Um, it's, or like a hostel, it's bunk beds, um, it's adequate housing for usually the caravan people who aren't as, um-

[00:11:35] Speaker 6: Important?

[00:11:36] Speaker 1: Important, yeah. (coughs)

[00:11:38] Speaker 6: So not hostile, but a hostel.

[00:11:40] Speaker 1: A hostel, yeah.

[00:11:41] Speaker 7: Could be hostile. Mm-hmm.

[00:11:42] Speaker 1: Um, they mention, um, up in this one right here is the, uh, this first level of the in there. That's more of the area for eating, um, this little kind of a... Not a pub or p- uh, tavern. It's as much as they have as a mess hall as anything else. The top part is, um, where few of the... It's kind of like the whole administrative place where anything safe is held. It's where the, uh, (coughs) I-... the captain over the bridge. That's where he sleeps, his personal quarters are in and also like, the offices. Anything tied to administrations are here. And the top part is also some bunk beds and whatnot. Um, over here, it's the first level. And this one also is a little bit more of a general store. This one deals more with, um, not only general store, but also consumables, perishable, stuff like that. But if you need, um-

[00:12:34] Speaker 10: So it's-

[00:12:34] Speaker 1: All depending on-

[00:12:35] Speaker 10: ... other than like, the caravan needs?

[00:12:36] Speaker 1: Yeah, for like, other miscellaneous stuff. Um, then the top part's the same thing as over here. It's resting areas here and more of a, um, hostel area up top as well. You guys, for the night, are put up in... with one of the hostels, um, with some of the other crew, uh, as they, um, uh, rest. So it's kinda late in the evening and you guys are probably just dead tired of being on the road anyways, so you kinda head straight up and go to bed and whatnot. When you get down the next... when you get up the next morning, you find the, um, captain, head captain, um, was looking to see you. So they bring you down, they bring you up here-

[00:13:14] Speaker 11: He's the captain of the settlement?

[00:13:15] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[00:13:16] Speaker 11: The crossing, not of the caravan?

[00:13:18] Speaker 1: Yeah. And by captain, you kinda think there's kind of a consortium that-

[00:13:21] Speaker 12: Captain as in military, Frank?

[00:13:24] Speaker 1: Um-

[00:13:24] Speaker 12: Not like ship's captain?

[00:13:27] Speaker 1: Kinda quasi both. Um, so-

[00:13:30] Speaker 10: You're on water.

[00:13:31] Speaker 1: But it might be something you can talk to him about.

[00:13:32] Speaker 12: Yeah, it doesn't-

[00:13:33] Speaker 1: Um, they call him the captain. Um, but he asks you guys to come see him. When you guys get there, you meet a dwarf who looks like something.

[00:13:42] Speaker 10: Are you a dwarf too? (laughs)

[00:13:47] Speaker 1: Well, that's... Where did I put those? They were sitting up here and I thought I could just put them elsewhere. There we go. Looks like this.

[00:14:00] Speaker 10: Oh.

[00:14:02] Speaker 1: He has a miniature also.

[00:14:04] Speaker 12: That's suspicious.

[00:14:06] Speaker 10: What?

[00:14:08] Speaker 12: That he has a miniature.

[00:14:10] Speaker 10: He might be one of the dramatis personae or whatever. Maybe he's really me. (laughs)

[00:14:17] Speaker 1: So you've met your third dramatis personae, Mm-hmm. This is the whole miniature I wanted to paint for some time. It's my Witcher dwarf.

[00:14:26] Speaker 10: Oh. (laughs)

[00:14:27] Speaker 1: So, I'll just put him up there. So, he comes and asks you to see him. You're brought into this tower right there and he says, um, "Greetings." Um, eventually I'll switch over to my Highland accent which... Whatever. "Um, greetings, um, welcome. I hear you're the, uh, group from the caravan that will be staying with us."

[00:14:49] Speaker 10: Yes, that's right. I hear you wanted to speak to us?

[00:14:52] Speaker 1: "Aye, well, I figured I'd see who would come. My name is Irka, Irka Spritzel. Some of you might remember that name from... You don't remember?"

[00:15:07] Speaker 10: I don't. (laughs)

[00:15:09] Speaker 1: Maybe not. In, um, the, uh, winter campaign we did. What was the name of that one? Icewind Dale? Or not Icewind Dale.

[00:15:16] Speaker 12: Oh.

[00:15:16] Speaker 10: Yeah. Yeah.

[00:15:16] Speaker 1: (coughs) He was the, uh-

[00:15:18] Speaker 10: Yeah.

[00:15:18] Speaker 1: ... dwarf you guys traveled up with.

[00:15:20] Speaker 12: Okay.

[00:15:20] Speaker 10: Yeah, okay.

[00:15:22] Speaker 1: Same name, different dwarf. Um, but he says, "Well, greetings. I'm the, uh, captain as mu- as the people here refer to me as, the head person over, uh, Tegrim's Crossing here." Um, "I, um-"

[00:15:36] Speaker 11: "I am called Kotal."

[00:15:39] Speaker 1: Ah, well met.

[00:15:40] Speaker 11: "How do, how do you spell your name?"

[00:15:41] Speaker 1: (laughs) Irka. I-R-K-A.

[00:15:44] Speaker 10: (laughs)

[00:15:45] Speaker 11: "And your last name is spelled how?"

[00:15:50] Speaker 1: Kotal, he writes all of this down. "I think it's Spritzel. S-P-R-I-T-Z-E-L."

[00:15:56] Speaker 11: "Aha, excellent. My god is always listening (laughs) and he will transcribe your name into the annals of history."

[00:16:04] Speaker 12: Which means giant pretzel.

[00:16:05] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[00:16:05] Speaker 12: (laughs)

[00:16:07] Speaker 1: You know, really the origin for that name is really strange. We had a guy in the group, his name was John, was it? It's been so long since I was with the group, but, um, he went to Brian's-

[00:16:17] Speaker 10: The really skinny guy?

[00:16:19] Speaker 1: In the very first campaign we did, he had a, he had to have a contact in the world and he just gave this dwarf the name of Irka Spritzel. And I never figured out... To me, it was one of the weirdest name, but for some odd reason, I've always remembered that he named his-

[00:16:32] Speaker 10: Was that the one on the island?

[00:16:33] Speaker 1: Mm-hmm. Yeah, not long ago. Anyway, he says, uh, he goes... Um, not there. "Um, and you're my, uh, um, brother from the east."

[00:16:45] Speaker 10: Uh, hi, I'm Roldan Grimstone. Pleasure to meet you, Irka.

[00:16:48] Speaker 1: "No, it's good. We, we see a decent amount of your kinds. Um, well, not your kind, uh, of our brothers that come through here, but ah, not as... Slowly have seen a few more, so it's good to have you here."

[00:17:03] Speaker 10: Do you see many Duergar out in these parts?

[00:17:05] Speaker 1: "Um, some. They, um, there were some involved in the, uh, building of the, uh, road. Um, granted, it was us dwarves who oversaw the road and the building, and the building of Tegrim's Crossing. Tegrim is named after the dwarf who designed it. Um, the, uh, your, uh, Duergar were involved. No, you were involved much further to the east and closer to the building of your new port. Coincidentally, I'll point out too, as far as this goes, this is slightly... it's not halfway between the two ends, but it's kinda like 45% closer to the, um, Iron Kingdoms and where the Highland dwarves are than it is to where like your folks are from. So it's a little further than half."

[00:17:49] Speaker 12: Mm-hmm.

[00:17:49] Speaker 10: So halfway. All right.

[00:17:53] Speaker 1: Um, but he says, "Yes, um, Tegrim's Crossing was built, um, it was about, what, 40 years ago? Um, these, uh, for 40 years or for a while, for about 10 or 20 years, uh, this bridge, which is nothing more than a bridge, but, uh, it was built with a foresight that eventually they could build a-... buildings on top of it, um, which he eventually did. And those, some of these villages that you see here were completed about 10 years ago. About 10 to 15. So everything here is quite new, and we are still very much in growing pains.

[00:18:30] Speaker 13: What sort of pains do you have?

[00:18:32] Speaker 1: Uh, there's no end to the amount of headache and monstrosities that we have to deal with here. We're lucky to the (coughs) north-east.

[00:18:45] Speaker 13: Mm-hmm.

[00:18:45] Speaker 1: Make sure I got the right one there. Yep. I can't see the E on there. Uh, to the east, that lands, this is off going up way far down the road is where you guys get to bear canoes and eventually, um, the highland area. Um-

[00:18:57] Speaker 14: That's where we came from, right?

[00:18:58] Speaker 15: West.

[00:18:58] Speaker 1: No.

[00:18:58] Speaker 15: That would be west.

[00:18:59] Speaker 1: Was it west? And here I can put on the-

[00:19:01] Speaker 15: Iron Kingdoms would be west.

[00:19:03] Speaker 1: Yep, west, not east. Um, okay.

[00:19:05] Speaker 14: We came from the east.

[00:19:06] Speaker 1: You came from the east?

[00:19:07] Speaker 14: Yeah.

[00:19:08] Speaker 1: Um, I'm pointing to the wrong directions there. North. Yep, east would be that way, yeah. It's weird with the way I'm sitting here. I think, I think I'm measuring on the other side. Um, (coughs) but to the rest of the Iron Kingdoms, um, that area, I mean, there are some humans who claim the land, but the, uh, Bovok claim most of that land, among many other various beasties. But they're one of the major ones who claim that one. But they only claim up until the river. To the, that's to the west. To the east of us, that is claimed by orcs primarily and all other sorts that, of them. But they also only claim to the river, which is why this element is built rich. Um, uh, no one claims this... Um, well, I mean, there are some who do, and there are some aquatic creatures that aren't particularly happy we're here. I can't say they claim the river, but, uh, but there's always caravans coming in. There's always some monsters stamping on something. And the guards, we have at least a number of guards here, but they are here to protect the bridge specifically. Um, they cannot go down the road and investigate, uh, you know, there's something going on. And there are some other people who've tried to settle here. Mostly they've not been successful. Um, so there's never been... There's always been a need for people who are willing to assist with things. And I would guess a fair amount of coin to be made from doing so.

[00:20:37] Speaker 13: Well, in Grimnir's name, I'll help as I can.

[00:20:40] Speaker 1: Right. You actually have no idea how it warms my heart-

[00:20:44] Speaker 13: Yeah.

[00:20:44] Speaker 1: ... to see a, a slayer here, no less.

[00:20:47] Speaker 13: At your service.

[00:20:50] Speaker 1: Trust me, you shall find no end of things that, uh, is-

[00:20:54] Speaker 13: Need slaying.

[00:20:54] Speaker 1: ... challenges that need to be slain. Um, so, and, uh, I may have something for you too, by the way. I've n- afraid not much time today. The caravan came in and these can be very trying times. This was a particularly large caravan that, uh, came in this time. And they'll be staying with us for another day or two as it gets repaired and fixed. Um, (clears throat) the wee little goblins are, uh, coming in to help repair the, the wagons. Um, now when he says goblins in this case, 'cause all of you to be aware of this, uh, and you guys are aware from the lore that there's wild goblins and there's domesticated versions of them. So there are wild goblins, like some of the ones you guys fought. They're very much Lord of the Rings-like. Um, and they're kind of the lowest part of the food chain. They're incredibly... But because of that, they're kind of like shrews. They're incredibly vicious. Um, but there are some goblins that have become more domesticated and they look like piezo goblins, if you're familiar with those. They are still little wild little psychos, but they're much more domesticated. They tend to live around various settlements. You'll see them on ships sometimes. You'll see them, like, in this case, they, they live nearby. They're too wild to live in society, but they're not strong enough to survive on their own. Um, usually they live in society in a kind of a mutualistic relationship. So it wouldn't entirely be a surprise if little goblins that come in and sit there. And they have to do a lot in life as they fix up the wagons and repair things. And then they get coin, food, and then some protection possibly from the place here. Where some of you guys are from in your kingdoms, you probably have seen that. Maybe not in yours, 'cause goblins are always extinct.

[00:22:31] Speaker 13: Yeah, I was gonna say-

[00:22:32] Speaker 1: But-

[00:22:32] Speaker 13: ... I, I must admit, like-

[00:22:33] Speaker 1: (sighs).

[00:22:33] Speaker 13: ... it's odd seeing goblins so friendly. I spent the better part of my youth fighting them.

[00:22:38] Speaker 1: I, well, these, these, uh, I haven't caught a name for them. The domesticated versions are almost a separate species at this point. But, um, I'll come up with a good one. I'll call them nobble. Uh, well, no. I can't think of a good name for them. I'll come up with something.

[00:22:53] Speaker 13: Noblins.

[00:22:54] Speaker 1: Um, um, they're these, these, uh, less wild ones. They're actually quite useful. They're a chaotic little bunch, but they do, uh, a decent job. They come in, they fix up the wagons, um, try not to get run over. Um, they get some food out of it. Usually, they'll eat anything, including waste, which no one else wants, they seem to like. So, um-

[00:23:18] Speaker 15: Now, when you say waste...

[00:23:21] Speaker 1: Um, you wouldn't imagine eating a day-old apple core, would you?

[00:23:24] Speaker 13: Okay.

[00:23:25] Speaker 1: For these little guys, that's like a-

[00:23:27] Speaker 13: I was picturing something way nastier, so.

[00:23:29] Speaker 1: (coughs). Well, they are goblins. But maybe not that nasty. Um, but it's really just about anything. They'll happily eat it. Um, but, uh, obviously this is a lot to take care of. And then we have another caravan probably, I'm anticipating, in another few days. So we gotta get them outta here. Give us enough time to get cleaned up and then for this next one to come in. And then who knows? It could be another month or, well, it could be a month or two. It could be less until we have more caravans. It's, it varies quite a bit. Um, but he says, "I may have something you could do." Um, we've had some goblins in the area recently. Not the nice kind. Um, off into the, um, east, that'd be this direction, um-That, uh... Why do I keep thinking this direction is west? I don't know why. Am I looking at that wrong?

[00:24:27] Speaker 16: No, that way is-

[00:24:28] Speaker 1: No, that's-

[00:24:28] Speaker 16: This is north.

[00:24:28] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[00:24:28] Speaker 16: That way is east.

[00:24:29] Speaker 1: Yeah. Oh, go figure. Just weird from my point of view, I suppose. Um, at any rate, um-

[00:24:36] Speaker 2: Make your life easier-

[00:24:38] Speaker 1: Um, yeah. (laughs)

[00:24:39] Speaker 2: ... print out your world map-

[00:24:40] Speaker 17: Switching if you need to.

[00:24:40] Speaker 2: ... hang it right here. And then east will be that way.

[00:24:44] Speaker 16: Yeah, I was thinking-

[00:24:44] Speaker 2: And west will be that way.

[00:24:45] Speaker 1: It's on my-

[00:24:46] Speaker 16: Put it on the TV.

[00:24:46] Speaker 1: Yeah, it's up there.

[00:24:47] Speaker 2: But then it would be backwards. If it's on the TV, it's backwards, that's what the-

[00:24:49] Speaker 16: Yeah.

[00:24:49] Speaker 1: Well, I can reverse the image. Um-

[00:24:51] Speaker 16: You could also just flip the world if you find it easier.

[00:24:54] Speaker 1: Yeah. (laughs) I could just hit mirror.

[00:24:55] Speaker 2: Does it really matter?

[00:24:56] Speaker 16: (laughs)

[00:24:56] Speaker 2: This can be east if you want it to be.

[00:24:58] Speaker 16: Yeah.

[00:24:58] Speaker 2: Just spin the coin. (laughs)

[00:25:00] Speaker 1: No, no. It's easier for me like this, I'm looking upstream. Um, (clears throat), wait 'til we actually see if we look off the bridge here. Anyway, he says, uh, so but, um-

[00:25:08] Speaker 16: Could just do it from your perspective and it's like, west to me, so.

[00:25:10] Speaker 1: (laughs) He says, "You know-"

[00:25:12] Speaker 16: Look at him.

[00:25:13] Speaker 1: Um, "I'll see if you guys could be willing to do a small patrol, uh, out in this area. Sometimes when these caravans come in, it stirs up the locals and then they in turn come for trouble. Um, that's why the, uh, horses are on that side, or the we- they're actually on the west side, sorry. Um, we wouldn't put, uh, horses on the east side. Uh, the orcs and goblins see them as food. We'd have nowhere to get them anything. The Bovok don't care. They see them as pack animals, they could care less. Um, so he's, he's arranging that thing for you guys, you know, run some recon, may take all day. Um, when then another guard comes and he whispers into his ear, um, and says, "Wha-" Um, he gets kind of agitated. He's like, again, he kinda curses in Dwarvish a little bit, um, like, "Every damn time. I don't have enough and now they're here." He looks at you guys and says, "I don't suppose I'd have one or two of you that could do a favor for me. Um, we have, uh, a few wild fey that have shown up. Uh, apparently, they claim there's some sort of, uh, emergency that they need help with. Um, we have other issues with them from time to time, more as being pests. Uh, would one of her two- one or two of you be able to humor them and, uh, see if you could help them out?"

[00:26:31] Speaker 18: If I may be of service, I will help.

[00:26:34] Speaker 16: Kotal, perhaps we should leave our other companions to rest while we go out.

[00:26:37] Speaker 1: So, the other companions and, um, Sylvia, um, agree to go off on this little patrol. Um, and then you guys are kind of left to, um, head out into the, uh, uh, forest.

[00:26:50] Speaker 16: Is Lynn with us?

[00:26:51] Speaker 1: Uh, he, Lynn is here, but he's kind of away from you guys at this point.

[00:26:55] Speaker 17: (laughs)

[00:26:55] Speaker 1: Um, there was a place he was going to. He kind of gets up and hits other things he wants to look into. Um-

[00:27:01] Speaker 17: Cool, cool.

[00:27:01] Speaker 1: But you can catch up with him in time. Um, so they take you guys out of the, uh, it'll be to the west, which is that side. Um, and you see a guard standing over there, um, being pestered by a few little fey. You have pictures somewhere?

[00:27:23] Speaker 16: Every time I take out a picture, I'm just looking at Kent like, "Is this you?"

[00:27:26] Speaker 17: (laughs)

[00:27:27] Speaker 1: So, by the way, he is a dramatic personality. The ones you're seeing here-

[00:27:32] Speaker 2: What was his name again?

[00:27:34] Speaker 1: Uh, Orca?

[00:27:35] Speaker 2: Orca.

[00:27:36] Speaker 1: All right.

[00:27:36] Speaker 2: Very special.

[00:27:38] Speaker 1: And there are three little fey. All right, I don't like that. Oh, my-

[00:27:43] Speaker 16: Ooh, you printed those fancy.

[00:27:45] Speaker 1: Luckily, AI is good for a lot of things and one of them is creating collages. Um-

[00:27:50] Speaker 16: Not being just like actual, like-

[00:27:51] Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

[00:27:52] Speaker 16: ... picture paper.

[00:27:53] Speaker 17: Or on paper.

[00:27:53] Speaker 16: Yeah.

[00:27:53] Speaker 1: Well, there's gonna be basically two boards. There's gonna be one for dramatic persona and then a min- minor dramatic persona. Let me see if I have...

[00:28:02] Speaker 2: It was printed, therefore it-

[00:28:03] Speaker 16: (laughs)

[00:28:03] Speaker 2: ... must be one or the other.

[00:28:04] Speaker 16: (laughs)

[00:28:05] Speaker 1: There are gonna be some that maybe reappear.

[00:28:07] Speaker 16: More monsters.

[00:28:10] Speaker 1: Or... No, I don't have them all.

[00:28:14] Speaker 2: Pesky little quest givers.

[00:28:16] Speaker 16: Mm-hmm.

[00:28:16] Speaker 1: Put them up there.

[00:28:17] Speaker 16: Have little arrows above their head?

[00:28:19] Speaker 1: I don't know.

[00:28:20] Speaker 17: (coughs)

[00:28:20] Speaker 16: They're like-

[00:28:20] Speaker 1: So-

[00:28:21] Speaker 16: ... "Maybe they need help with something urgent."

[00:28:23] Speaker 1: They come and, um, the three of them are fluttering around, um, and they say, "Oh, please, we could use some help." The guards point to them. They fly up to you two. And like, "Please, please, we, um..." Well, the one that's mainly talking to you is the purple one in the middle. "I am called Kotal. Well done. What can I be of service to you little ones?" Um, and by the way, these are like 3x (inaudible). They look at you and say, "Well, we're in-"

[00:28:46] Speaker 2: They're flying?

[00:28:47] Speaker 1: "... great danger." And they're flying, yeah.

[00:28:48] Speaker 2: Okay.

[00:28:49] Speaker 1: Um, do you guys have nature, either of you?

[00:28:51] Speaker 2: Yes.

[00:28:51] Speaker 16: I don't know.

[00:28:52] Speaker 2: "I am called Kotal. I am from-"

[00:28:56] Speaker 16: I do not.

[00:28:56] Speaker 2: "... the beautiful, the da- the jungle. I have force nature."

[00:29:00] Speaker 1: Um, you don't necessarily need to roll on this-

[00:29:02] Speaker 2: Okay.

[00:29:02] Speaker 1: ... 'cause you're gonna know this much.

[00:29:03] Speaker 2: Yes.

[00:29:03] Speaker 1: Um, these three are fairies. You can tell the difference. There's three main types of fey. Well, there's a bunch of, there's, there's numerous. Um, fairies have wings, have butterfly wings.

[00:29:12] Speaker 2: Okay.

[00:29:13] Speaker 1: Um, sprites don't have any wings.

[00:29:14] Speaker 2: That one on the left is definitely in, like, uh, like a spicy romance book.

[00:29:20] Speaker 1: Ah. Oh, the boy?

[00:29:21] Speaker 2: The kind that my wife likes to read.

[00:29:23] Speaker 1: (laughs) I, I, I define male fairy that looks-

[00:29:26] Speaker 2: Male fey is like the f- it's popular right now.

[00:29:29] Speaker 1: Oh.

[00:29:30] Speaker 2: For her like-

[00:29:30] Speaker 1: Is it-

[00:29:31] Speaker 2: ... fairies of some kind that like kidnap humans and they fall in love and-

[00:29:35] Speaker 1: What?

[00:29:35] Speaker 16: Urban love.

[00:29:35] Speaker 2: It's like, what's that book series? Uh, what's the one that's super popular? Um, Court of Stone and Roses?

[00:29:43] Speaker 16: I think you're referring-

[00:29:43] Speaker 2: No, this is like fantasy. I think Court of Stone and Roses is about like a human who gets taken to the fey and there's like a hunky elf fey thing.

[00:29:53] Speaker 16: I think Emily is reading that.

[00:29:54] Speaker 1: (laughs)

[00:29:55] Speaker 16: (laughs)

[00:29:56] Speaker 1: So-

[00:29:56] Speaker 16: I haven't asked any questions about it, so I don't know.

[00:29:59] Speaker 1: Um, she goes, "Yes, um, if you would please, please be able to come help us, um, the- the great, um, our friend, the, uh, uh, Willow." Um... Goddamn it, I'm crying it down. I'll remember her name when it comes up. Um, I'll call him A- goddamn it. This is why you write things down instead of naming her. (sings)

Ignore all the other people you might be seeing.

[00:30:30] Speaker 19: My eyes are closed.

[00:30:31] Speaker 20: Uh, I'm 51 years old and cannot read text that small.

[00:30:33] Speaker 21: Oh.

[00:30:34] Speaker 20: From this distance. (laughs)

[00:30:35] Speaker 21: (laughs)

[00:30:36] Speaker 1: You need not worry.

[00:30:37] Speaker 21: Yeah.

[00:30:38] Speaker 1: Oh, the name will come to me. I wrote it... I had everything printed out. And... it's up here somewhere.

[00:30:44] Speaker 21: I think maybe, uh-

[00:30:45] Speaker 20: Yes. Mm-hmm.

[00:30:47] Speaker 1: But the great, uh, dryad, um, she's in great danger. She's being attacked by spider creatures and we need some help. We can't fend them off for us... you know, spider creatures.

[00:30:58] Speaker 22: Where?

[00:30:59] Speaker 1: Um, oh, we can take you there. It's not too far away. Um, but we must get... only two of you we need, uh, additional assistance. Um, the, the young male fairy, um... well, so they introduced themselves too. Um, her name is Silvermist. That's the one in the middle. Uh, on the side there, um, his name is Fawn. And then the other one over there is, um, Iridescent. And, um, she just introduces themself and-

[00:31:30] Speaker 20: Who, who's the s- primary speaker?

[00:31:32] Speaker 1: Primary speaker is Silvermist in the center there. Um, she says, "Yeah, we're in, in great need." Um, the other one flies up, the kinda pinkish one. She kinda flies up next to you guys and goes, "But you know, Silvermist, we, we can't just take her there. Do we know that they're trustworthy? They, they could be bad people." Um, and that's... and Silvermist looks and stuff and, "Oh, yes, that's right. They must be tested." She points to you guys. Um, she initially-

[00:31:57] Speaker 20: She's foreshadowed.

[00:31:58] Speaker 19: (laughs)

[00:31:59] Speaker 1: (laughs)

[00:31:59] Speaker 21: (laughs) Yeah, some ways.

[00:32:00] Speaker 22: Oh, yeah, the tests have begun.

[00:32:01] Speaker 1: Says, "You must prove that you are... show that you are worthy to, um... you're gonna be entering into the sacred glade of, of, uh, the willow. And, uh, you know, can't just have anyone go there. So you must be of pure heart." So she flies up to you first, um, and says, "You come across... there's a, a young skunk by the name of Roderick. Um, he has been... let himself go recently. He's been eating a ton of, uh, garbage and he's not been cleaning his fur, and, uh, stuff like that. How do you tell him that, about his condition?" And she looks at you. She flies up right next to you. You know if you're looking through a doorbell cam, everything's kind of blurred?

[00:32:44] Speaker 21: Yeah.

[00:32:44] Speaker 1: You know, she's like looking right in front of your face, at eyes and like... yeah, her like head's big, but her body's leaning off and kind of small. And she's just staring intently at you wondering how you would deal with, uh... how you would approach a smelly skunk and what you would tell him about his demeanor?

[00:33:01] Speaker 23: My friend, w- w- uh, you have... you are out of balance. May I assist you in finding harmony again with your environment?

[00:33:11] Speaker 1: "Oh, harmony," she says. "I like that. Skunks are oftentimes not in harmony with their environment. Um, yes, I think that would be quite nicely." She seems happy. Uh, she then points over to, um... goddammit, which one? The pink one. Uh, Iridescent.

[00:33:29] Speaker 21: Iridescence.

[00:33:30] Speaker 20: Iridescence.

[00:33:30] Speaker 1: Um, and says, "Yes, he must be tested." And Iridescent flies over to you, but she kind of looks shy. She's kind of tapping her fingers and looking down. She's like-

[00:33:38] Speaker 22: It's okay, little one. Take your time.

[00:33:41] Speaker 1: Just so-

[00:33:41] Speaker 20: TikTok. She's like on TikTok.

[00:33:42] Speaker 1: Yeah. Just so, um... there's, there's this, this rabbit. We'll call him George. And he's such a cute fluffy bunny and he has nice fur, but he's really hungry. But he has spots on him and a big fluffy no- a big wet nose and a fluffy tail and floppy ears, but he's just oh so hungry. You have a blueberry and a strawberry. Which one do you give him? And she kind of flies up to you. And you can tell she's just, you know, hands clen- she's staring at you like this is really important. Like, you get a feeling that, um, your answer is going to make or break her day.

[00:34:17] Speaker 21: Oh, alas, little bunny, I do not know what you prefer, a strawberry or blueberry. So I offer both and let him choose.

[00:34:24] Speaker 1: So she, um, squeals in glee, um, because that answer exceeded her expectations, obviously. (coughs) And she's like, "Yes, yes, they are, they are so worthy." Um, and Iridescent then says, "Yes, they have proven their worth. Um, we must now take haste." Um, Fawn volunteers, the boy. He says, "Well, I'm gonna go off and find old Willy." Um, Iridescent pipes up, "Oh, Willy? Are you sure you want him? He failed the test multiple times." And Fawn just says, "That doesn't matter. Um, if he's not willing to join us, perhaps, um, we can acquire some of his yummy, uh, boysenberries from his place, which will surely assist us in our endeavor." So he flutters off. Um, he was on the... you wanna... east side of the bank. He-

[00:35:09] Speaker 20: It's west.

[00:35:10] Speaker 1: Goddammit.

[00:35:11] Speaker 20: (laughs)

[00:35:12] Speaker 19: (laughs)

[00:35:13] Speaker 1: (laughs) You know I can generally not tell my right and my left if I'm not holding a pencil, by the way? So this is gonna be a repeating theme for me today.

[00:35:20] Speaker 20: I understand. I mean-

[00:35:21] Speaker 19: (laughs)

[00:35:21] Speaker 1: You can, you can do that and you can also flip it and that's the problem.

[00:35:24] Speaker 20: But I mean, I was like, you know, I'm making a W, it's a West. West.

[00:35:27] Speaker 19: (laughs) Um, Iridescent, in the future-

[00:35:32] Speaker 1: (laughs)

[00:35:32] Speaker 19: ... what do rabbits prefer, strawberries or blueberries?

[00:35:36] Speaker 1: Oh, um, she says, "It depends on the rabbit and the situation. Strawberries are very good. Rabbits love strawberries. But sometimes they love blueberries or boysenberries or raspberries."

[00:35:48] Speaker 19: Mm.

[00:35:48] Speaker 1: "Um, they love all sorts of things."

[00:35:50] Speaker 19: They're not very picky.

[00:35:51] Speaker 1: But if you give them both, oh, that's really good. Um, so, um, Silvermist says, "We'll find it. Two of you come with us. Um, we'll, um," (coughs) "we'll head out this way. I know of one or two other humans who may be able to assist us, um, who are nearby. And then we shall make our way post haste to the, um, Enchanted Grove." So you guys fly off a little ways. You continue on down. You're on one side of the bank, west. Um, (laughs) it's gonna be a long campaign.

[00:36:25] Speaker 21: (laughs) I gotta get some permanent magic marker for you, Craig.

[00:36:29] Speaker 1: Yeah. (laughs)

[00:36:30] Speaker 21: (laughs)

[00:36:31] Speaker 1: So, um-Fawn flies off, kind of in a direction, um, he actually starts crossing the water and he's heading off to the east a little ways, um, until he just disappears. Um, he seems to take, uh, to fly in and out about underneath the, uh... For someone in a hurry, it's, you know, he's having a fun time zipping in and out of the, under the bridge. But, um-

[00:36:52] Speaker 24: (coughs).

[00:36:53] Speaker 1: ... the two of you guys, they take you guys through the, uh, forest, um, and into... Here I have a little bit of a map (paper rustles). It's not much of one, 'cause you guys have not discovered things, so I chopped it all up. Let me... Here, I'll put this over here and... The map program I got is still in beta, so you can print, you need to print three titles of these. Everything curls. So, you guys came along this wagon route right here, which I had to put in brown. This is where the bridge is. So you guys have kind of seen this. You do see some forest on both sides of you. Up the top you do see some mountains that go off this way and in across the other direction.

[00:37:32] Speaker 25: The sea is up here. No, that's what came from the east.

[00:37:35] Speaker 26: Oh, yeah, okay.

[00:37:36] Speaker 25: That's the east.

[00:37:36] Speaker 1: This is the way you came. Um, so this way you'd be heading off towards the Iron Kingdom. That's where the caravans gonna be headed. You do have, um,............................

[00:37:43] Speaker 27: How far are we from the coast? It's like way-

[00:37:46] Speaker 1: Yeah, it's kind of-

[00:37:47] Speaker 27: ... way away or it's right here?

[00:37:48] Speaker 1: Oh, no, it's a ways off.

[00:37:49] Speaker 27: Okay.

[00:37:50] Speaker 1: So, you do notice a few things from where you were on the bridge, but, um, where you guys are, you're on the west side. She's taking off kind of in this direction. Now, as you look on the bridge, up this way a little ways, um, you see a island and there's kind of a... It's a little bit off in the distance, but it's a good, a decent rowboat ride to it. Um, it looks like a nice house built on there. If you look down this way, you see another island, um, not too far off. It's a bit closer than the house is. And you see a few buildings on that. Um, there's, uh, what looks to be like a small shack, even some fishing gear, um, and some boats, you've, um, on it. You see a, uh, that looks like this. Right there. One of those you may have seen sometime. Well, it looks like this, um, sitting on the island. And then you see a small tower on the end. Not quite a lighthouse, but-

[00:38:40] Speaker 24: (coughs).

[00:38:40] Speaker 1: ... you know, a tower thing. The guards would have pointed it out. Um, this one you're seeing getting down this way where the tower is, and, uh, at least that's kind of the guard's island. Most of the guards don't live here. Um, they actually live in that little... That's kind of like their barracks. Um-

[00:38:58] Speaker 24: This one?

[00:38:59] Speaker 1: Yeah, that one down there. That's kind of their barracks. They just point out the, uh, the house is apparently abandoned. Um, one of the guys who helped build it from the m- w- during the construction of the bridge and whatnot, had lived there. But, uh, no longer does.

[00:39:14] Speaker 24: (laughs) West.

[00:39:18] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[00:39:18] Speaker 24: (laughs)

[00:39:19] Speaker 1: I was thinking of getting a neon sign that sits on that side of the room that is light up and says, "West." Um, at any rate, um, you guys, uh... So she takes you a little way, a little ways down-

[00:39:29] Speaker 26: You gotta put him here.

[00:39:31] Speaker 24: Yeah. (laughs)

[00:39:33] Speaker 1: (laughs) Um-

[00:39:34] Speaker 24: Ah, sure.

[00:39:34] Speaker 1: She takes you a little ways down river.

[00:39:36] Speaker 26: We gotta put him here.

[00:39:37] Speaker 1: Well, this will be coming down pretty soon also, I know.

[00:39:39] Speaker 26: (laughs) Just kidding.

[00:39:40] Speaker 1: Um, but that works. Oh, yeah, you guys need coins.

[00:39:44] Speaker 26: So, like, um, out of curiosity, I mean, I'm not there, but how big are each of these, uh, hexes?

[00:39:49] Speaker 1: On there, I don't have the exact size. They're pretty big though.

[00:39:52] Speaker 25: It took us like three weeks to get along that trail. So, you know, that's-

[00:39:54] Speaker 1: That's not the entire length, but-

[00:39:56] Speaker 25: Oh, okay.

[00:39:56] Speaker 1: ... that's, um, (coughs) but it's a decent, uh... Oh, this thing is drawing miniatures. Um, oh, I didn't set the timer, so I need to... (dice rolling)

[00:40:10] Speaker 27: It's been 40 minutes.

[00:40:11] Speaker 1: Oh, 40? Oh.

[00:40:12] Speaker 27: On the clock.

[00:40:12] Speaker 1: Oh.

[00:40:12] Speaker 27: On the recording.

[00:40:13] Speaker 1: Once that hits, uh-

[00:40:14] Speaker 27: Oh.

[00:40:14] Speaker 1: ... an hour, let me know.

[00:40:15] Speaker 27: I got another one.

[00:40:16] Speaker 1: I normally could have a little egg timer here for that stuff but... Um, so I take you on a little ways and you guys are eventually brought to... Eventually, you come through even... It's a little bit of a trek, but she flies back and forth. Eventually, you come ac- across the small glade where she can even take like a five-minute break. Um, there's a little fairy circle on the ground. There's a... Which is kind of weird. It's a bunch of like crumbled statues. Um, one of the statues is kind of standing there. It's actually fully intact. It's kind of like a... There's like a fairy circle around it. Um...

[00:40:49] Speaker 25: Do we know anything about fairy circles?

[00:40:52] Speaker 1: Um...

[00:40:52] Speaker 26: They're circular?

[00:40:53] Speaker 1: I'd say you probably would know. I mean, obviously, heavily tied to the fae. They may or may not mean something magical. Usually, sometimes it's... You'll see them in areas where there's a lot of, a strong fae presence. They're not like teleportation or stuff-

[00:41:06] Speaker 25: They're not-

[00:41:06] Speaker 1: ... like they are another game systems, but-

[00:41:08] Speaker 25: But they're meaningful, they're-

[00:41:11] Speaker 1: They do have some meaning to 'em.

[00:41:12] Speaker 25: ... important to the fae?

[00:41:13] Speaker 26: Yeah, as a matter of fact, uh, might get this painted, but we'll grab a... Yeah, they do have some importance. They assimilate, seem to grow naturally, especially where there's a lot of, uh-

[00:41:21] Speaker 25: Oh, so there's, uh, these aren't like placed by... They're not ceremonial or something where the fae actually place them there? They just naturally occur?

[00:41:31] Speaker 1: They kind of naturally occur, but they're usually, they grow in the areas that are significant to the fae. Um, they don't, they don't grow them themselves, I'll put it that way.

[00:41:42] Speaker 26: Awesome. What is, uh...

[00:41:45] Speaker 1: So, she takes you there.

[00:41:46] Speaker 26: What is their statue?

[00:41:48] Speaker 1: Um, they're apparently, uh, they look to be of, um, humans, like one of them kind of in a little fairy circle.

[00:41:54] Speaker 26: All right.

[00:41:54] Speaker 1: There's a go-

[00:41:55] Speaker 26: Will the statue version kind of like that.

[00:41:58] Speaker 1: Yeah, and the other ones are kind of crumbled. (coughs) The fae just say, "Oh, yeah, those are, those are old statues."

[00:42:03] Speaker 26: Is that Yergi?

[00:42:04] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[00:42:04] Speaker 26: It does look like Yergi.

[00:42:05] Speaker 25: (laughs)

[00:42:05] Speaker 26: I was gonna say, is he wearing a loincloth?

[00:42:08] Speaker 25: (laughs)

[00:42:09] Speaker 1: I had to get, uh, yeah, to find an appropriate miniature.

[00:42:11] Speaker 25: (laughs)

[00:42:12] Speaker 1: Um, but you see it's, um, they say, "Well, yeah, those are the... There, there's ruins and old things all over the place around this area." Um, these guys are, you know, here, we don't... You know, they far since crumbled. But you guys can do a per-... Um, you can do crafting ideally. Um-

[00:42:31] Speaker 24: I got that.

[00:42:32] Speaker 1: (coughs) Society would also work. You guys can just roll.

[00:42:36] Speaker 28: ... plus zero in both.

[00:42:38] Speaker 29: How many did you roll?

[00:42:39] Speaker 28: Uh, 13.

[00:42:39] Speaker 1: What'd you roll?

[00:42:39] Speaker 29: 19 plus four, 23.

[00:42:41] Speaker 1: Oh, that's pretty good.

[00:42:42] Speaker 30: Are you doing secret rolls?

[00:42:43] Speaker 1: Yeah, sometimes.

[00:42:44] Speaker 29: Sometimes. Less often. Only when it's really important that you not know.

[00:42:48] Speaker 1: Technically this one should be-

[00:42:49] Speaker 29: Like stealth, I assume?

[00:42:52] Speaker 1: Well, it depends.

[00:42:52] Speaker 29: Or like-

[00:42:53] Speaker 1: It may... Stealth may depend.

[00:42:55] Speaker 29: Why?

[00:42:56] Speaker 1: If it's being tested against something. But I mean, if you're good at stealth, I think you would know if you're being clumsy and stupid and-

[00:43:00] Speaker 29: Yeah.

[00:43:00] Speaker 1: ... making noise. Um-

[00:43:02] Speaker 29: When it's actually, um, mysterious and not known.

[00:43:05] Speaker 1: It'll... Yeah. But there may be times when, you know, it has to be, but... So, any rate, um, yeah. Do you realize these aren't statues? Um, well, the crumbled ones obviously weren't. Um, this looks like this is, uh, these are actually people. They're too detailed.

[00:43:25] Speaker 31: Which one's with us?

[00:43:27] Speaker 1: Um, the two gals.

[00:43:28] Speaker 31: Okay.

[00:43:29] Speaker 1: Uh, Silvermist and Eridessa.

[00:43:31] Speaker 30: Uh, Madam Silvermist, I have noticed this is not statue.

[00:43:38] Speaker 1: What? But look, it's, it's stone and it looks like a person.

[00:43:42] Speaker 30: Is person.

[00:43:43] Speaker 1: Is person? Oh. She kinda looks at the-

[00:43:47] Speaker 30: They are, they are perhaps trapped.

[00:43:48] Speaker 1: She looks at, uh, um, Eridessa, who pulls out... Oh, I actually have them. Interesting. I'll take a look.

[00:43:57] Speaker 30: They're fairies?

[00:43:59] Speaker 1: Yeah, they're medium-sized fairies. They might have totally forgotten about you. Um, but they look at, they look at (laughs) each other.

[00:44:05] Speaker 30: This may be our beat.

[00:44:06] Speaker 29: (laughs)

[00:44:06] Speaker 1: Eridessa, um says, "Well, if they're humans, they must be hungry. We've had them there forever and they've never eaten before." So she pulls out a strawberry and starts shoving it in the, uh, the one that's intact in the, uh-

[00:44:19] Speaker 28: Here he-

[00:44:19] Speaker 1: ... in the ring. Um, the miniature of Yuri.

[00:44:23] Speaker 30: It's not really Yuri.

[00:44:25] Speaker 1: Where is the... Uh, well, for now, let's do one thing. I want something. That's like the other thing, okay, don't move for now. There's too much stuff and anything isn't neither clear. All right. Vacation company that's kind of on the, uh, docket is clean up and arrange things. So we have miniatures. Um, Eridessa, who is holding a strawberry, um, starts shoving it in his mouth. You also notice that it's, it's a human and right behind the shoulder appears to be a little fey creature also peering out over his collar. Um, but she shoves it in his mouth, shoves a little bit in the, uh, um, little fey creatures that's sitting behind his... you know, behind the collar's mouth. And yeah, kind of like the, uh, scene from Star Wars with Han Solo and carbonite. It slowly starts coming to life and then just falls forward and start- you know, starts gasping a little bit, kind of, you know, like Han Solo. You're out of your filter.

[00:45:37] Speaker 31: Dammit, you'll never get my recipe!

[00:45:40] Speaker 30: I did not expect that to happen. (laughs)

[00:45:43] Speaker 1: Um, Silvermist, or, uh, Eridessa is really, really happy that this happened. So, he's a little groggy. And while he... you're kind of getting your, you know, your head cleared. Um, she goes off and starts shoving-

[00:45:53] Speaker 31: I reach out to him.

[00:45:54] Speaker 1: She starts shoving her strawberries into the mouths of the other statues that have crumbled. Um, and yeah, they, they, uh, come out of stone too.

[00:46:01] Speaker 30: (laughs) In pieces.

[00:46:03] Speaker 1: In pieces. Um, if they had lived, they don't live very long. Um, but their clothes and their backpacks are still intact.

[00:46:11] Speaker 30: Is this man injured?

[00:46:13] Speaker 1: Um, you can do, uh... If you guys want to do medicine on him, you can.

[00:46:18] Speaker 30: Yeah, we'll try to check for like, by-

[00:46:20] Speaker 31: Get your hands off me, you damn kid.

[00:46:21] Speaker 30: ... before he took off?

[00:46:23] Speaker 1: Um, if you have the gold for it, yeah.

[00:46:24] Speaker 30: Okay. I'd say probably use it to grab one.

[00:46:27] Speaker 29: I got a 16.

[00:46:28] Speaker 31: Whatever. (laughs)

[00:46:28] Speaker 29: Or a 15.

[00:46:30] Speaker 1: Um-

[00:46:31] Speaker 31: I have 15 also.

[00:46:32] Speaker 29: Are you an actual lizard man or are you a, um-

[00:46:34] Speaker 32: A slan. Well, slan, but-

[00:46:36] Speaker 29: Slan.

[00:46:37] Speaker 32: ... lizard folk mechanically.

[00:46:38] Speaker 29: Okay.

[00:46:39] Speaker 32: But-

[00:46:39] Speaker 29: I thought it was like-

[00:46:40] Speaker 32: Warhammer slan.

[00:46:42] Speaker 29: Uh, I thought... I was thinking you were doing a, um, predator.

[00:46:45] Speaker 32: That was for the one shot.

[00:46:47] Speaker 29: Okay.

[00:46:48] Speaker 1: Um, yeah. He's, um, you know, he's free of the carbonite basically. Um, give him five minutes and, you know, the webs will have cleared. He looks... Uh, by your familiar health, your medicine check, he looks fine otherwise. The little sprite that... Or little, okay, I just gave it away, sprite. You can tell it's a sprite-

[00:47:04] Speaker 30: It's Doc Brown basically.

[00:47:05] Speaker 29: Yes.

[00:47:05] Speaker 30: (laughs)

[00:47:06] Speaker 1: I put two of them, by the way. Oh-

[00:47:08] Speaker 30: It's a picture of Doc Brown. (laughs)

[00:47:11] Speaker 1: Here. Here's, um-

[00:47:12] Speaker 30: (laughs)

[00:47:13] Speaker 29: That is Doc Brown.

[00:47:14] Speaker 1: I printed both.

[00:47:14] Speaker 28: It was based off Doc Brown, yes. (laughs)

[00:47:16] Speaker 1: Is that... I printed an AI when I tried to give him armor.

[00:47:18] Speaker 28: (laughs)

[00:47:20] Speaker 1: So there's both versions of him.

[00:47:22] Speaker 28: It's exactly what he's based off, is Doc Brown. (laughs)

[00:47:25] Speaker 1: And the, um-

[00:47:26] Speaker 30: What's up, Doc?

[00:47:27] Speaker 28: With the crazy ass hair. (laughs)

[00:47:29] Speaker 1: The creature that's with him pops up and after a few minutes starts fluttering too. Looks like that. You know it's a sprite because it has no wings.

[00:47:38] Speaker 30: Mm-hmm.

[00:47:38] Speaker 1: Um, basically there is-

[00:47:40] Speaker 30: And this was it.

[00:47:42] Speaker 1: This was the thing that was hiding-

[00:47:43] Speaker 30: That thing is stone also?

[00:47:43] Speaker 1: Yep.

[00:47:44] Speaker 30: Okay.

[00:47:44] Speaker 1: It was the thing that was hiding behind his collar looking forward also.

[00:47:46] Speaker 30: What ma- What, what was petrified?

[00:47:48] Speaker 1: Yep. I'll put it right there for now. All right. Um-

[00:47:55] Speaker 28: You are a lucky fellow.

[00:47:57] Speaker 30: Is, uh... Do I know that if sprites speak Common?

[00:48:01] Speaker 1: Um-

[00:48:01] Speaker 30: Like, I'm trying to talk to... Are you, are you all right, little one?

[00:48:05] Speaker 1: Um, she looks at you kind of curiously.

[00:48:07] Speaker 31: Don't trust her.

[00:48:08] Speaker 1: And then starts, um-

[00:48:09] Speaker 30: I'm furious.

[00:48:09] Speaker 1: ... she starts just pantomiming things. Um, the other fey come over and look at her a little bit. Um-

[00:48:18] Speaker 30: I don't speak FSL.

[00:48:20] Speaker 1: Uh-

[00:48:20] Speaker 30: Fairy sign language.

[00:48:22] Speaker 29: (laughs)

[00:48:23] Speaker 1: It's an old-

[00:48:24] Speaker 30: ASL but for fairies.

[00:48:25] Speaker 1: She might have a hard time speaking with you.

[00:48:27] Speaker 29: Yeah, yeah.

[00:48:28] Speaker 1: Um, uh, it appears her voice is still frozen. It'll come through in time.

[00:48:34] Speaker 30: Okay.

[00:48:35] Speaker 1: Um, her, her voice will pick-

[00:48:37] Speaker 29: What happened to your friend?

[00:48:40] Speaker 33: It did by trying to get my recipe. I told them they couldn't have it and they turned me to stone. Damn crazy Fairy Queen and her minions.

[00:48:49] Speaker 34: What recipe are they trying to get from you?

[00:48:52] Speaker 33: My secret recipe, of course.

[00:48:54] Speaker 34: That's not-

[00:48:54] Speaker 33: I won't give them my recipe for my sandwishizzo.

[00:48:57] Speaker 34: For your sandwishizzo?

[00:48:59] Speaker 33: My sandwiches.

[00:49:00] Speaker 35: (coughs)

[00:49:00] Speaker 33: They're famous and incredible. They can't have them.

[00:49:05] Speaker 1: I will point out, it wasn't the fae that turned you to stone.

[00:49:09] Speaker 33: I don't think he knows that. (laughs)

[00:49:11] Speaker 34: It doesn't matter yet.

[00:49:11] Speaker 35: (laughs) He's redirecting his anger here.

[00:49:16] Speaker 1: So, um, (clears throat) um, well, actually, uh, the- the- this thing, uh, she starts just doing all these pantomimes to the other ones, like she's telling them a story. Um, (clears throat) and eventually they go, "Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh." They kind of turn around and look at you and they glare at you a little bit and then she goes, you know, more pantomime. It goes on for like five minutes. Very periodically looking at them.

[00:49:37] Speaker 33: It's not my fault she brought the basilisk around.

[00:49:39] Speaker 1: And staring around. Um, (clears throat) does she at what point now-

[00:49:42] Speaker 36: Kotal, I have no idea what is happening right now. (laughs)

[00:49:45] Speaker 37: Sounds like-

[00:49:47] Speaker 36: I am gathering that he was petrified by a basilisk.

[00:49:50] Speaker 1: She goes, "Yes, sounds like," um, "he and his companions," well, his companion mainly, uh, "were being a bit, uh, wild when they came out here." Um, and that they, "Must have come across the basilisk at some point," um.

[00:50:08] Speaker 33: That wasn't it. She was trying to steal my recipe.

[00:50:10] Speaker 1: (laughs)

[00:50:11] Speaker 33: I told them, "No recipe."

[00:50:14] Speaker 1: (laughs)

[00:50:14] Speaker 34: Are the basilisks still in the area?

[00:50:16] Speaker 1: Oh, well, there are some around.

[00:50:19] Speaker 34: Mm.

[00:50:21] Speaker 1: Well, I- I don't know how it'll go, but this thing has, this has been here for quite some time.

[00:50:26] Speaker 36: How long?

[00:50:27] Speaker 1: I don't know. They don't actually have much of a concept of time.

[00:50:32] Speaker 34: Yeah, most sure.

[00:50:32] Speaker 1: It's just been here this long.

[00:50:36] Speaker 34: Hmm.

[00:50:36] Speaker 1: We've only, you know.

[00:50:36] Speaker 36: How long since we left the bridge?

[00:50:39] Speaker 1: Mm, maybe.

[00:50:40] Speaker 36: Long time, then.

[00:50:45] Speaker 1: Um, well, you can kinda tell there's a bit of division. I mean, there, there's the fae and she's a sprite, so they're nice to her, but they're still kind of, you know, not the same thing. Um, (clears throat) she says, "Well, perhaps you can come with us, um, (clears throat) if you're willing to." Um, they kind of look at you. "Would, would you come assist us in our endeavor?"

[00:51:08] Speaker 33: What endeavor are you talking about?

[00:51:09] Speaker 1: "Oh, we have a, the- the Great Willow is, uh, under attack. She needs help. She's being attacked by spiders."

[00:51:18] Speaker 33: I take my big 10-foot pole that's in my hand and poke her. "I don't know. Are you real?"

[00:51:21] Speaker 1: "Oh, we're real. These spiders are even more real. Um, we'll assume you can help us, but..." And then Eerdiss pulls out, "But he must be tested." Um, so, uh, uh, Silvermist looks at him and says, "Yes, that's right. He can come with us, but he must be tested." Um, she flies up to you and says, "Tell me, what would you do with a drunken squirrel?"

[00:51:49] Speaker 33: First, I saute it. Then I baste it with some butter and some almonds. And then, you know, I have a good conversation with him. Uh, you know, "How's it going? What's, uh, what's it like with Alos?" You know, maybe something like that. Maybe throw some dice and then go out of my way.

[00:52:12] Speaker 1: They've, um, at least when you talked about sauteing him, looked a little horrified.

[00:52:16] Speaker 35: (laughs)

[00:52:16] Speaker 37: (laughs)

[00:52:16] Speaker 1: When they start talking to him, they're a little bit amused. Um, initially she goes, um, "That is incorrect. The correct answer is you let him sober up, but it sounds like your answer may have some merit. We'll tell you what, in, uh-"

[00:52:31] Speaker 36: You did not actually eat the squirrel, only sauteed it, so...

[00:52:36] Speaker 35: Oh.

[00:52:36] Speaker 1: (laughs) "So tell you what, for your-

[00:52:39] Speaker 35: (laughs)

[00:52:39] Speaker 1: ... um, (clears throat) fine service in protecting our friend here, um," (coughs) um, "we shall grant you some grace in this request." By that they mean protecting her, that means serving as her stone shield-

[00:52:53] Speaker 35: Mean shield. (laughs)

[00:52:54] Speaker 1: ... for God knows how long. Um, they introduce this one and says, uh, "By the way, her name is, um, Vidia."

[00:53:00] Speaker 33: Vidia.

[00:53:01] Speaker 1: V-I-D-I-A, I think it is, Vidia.

[00:53:04] Speaker 33: Got that, computer.

[00:53:05] Speaker 35: (laughs)

[00:53:07] Speaker 1: So Vidia has now joined your guys' party.

[00:53:09] Speaker 33: Got to-

[00:53:10] Speaker 1: Um-

[00:53:10] Speaker 33: ... get some stock in her. (laughs)

[00:53:12] Speaker 1: Throughout the campaign, she will go with your-

[00:53:14] Speaker 36: This is a M Vidia, not N Vidia.

[00:53:16] Speaker 33: (laughs)

[00:53:16] Speaker 36: Not as valuable.

[00:53:17] Speaker 33: Damn.

[00:53:19] Speaker 1: Um, actually I think it's V-I-D-A if I remember her spelling right. Um, at any rate, um, uh, so she'll serve in the campaign as, um, we have to yet to identify who she's centered around. Um, and she'll serve as a light source. Basically a flying torch around someone. Um, she'll also, any, um, items that you guys haven't claimed, she has like a magic bag of holding that will initially go in there.

[00:53:40] Speaker 35: Mm.

[00:53:40] Speaker 1: Um, and then once one of you guys have had to take the item, then it goes into your, um, character sheet, but she'll hold onto those while you guys haven't, um-

[00:53:48] Speaker 36: Mm, done asked them.

[00:53:49] Speaker 1: ... uh, haven't claimed them. So she has joined the party. Um, not as a, I don't know, she's not really a master or something. And she can't talk, so you won't be able to do much.

[00:53:58] Speaker 36: She's a-

[00:53:58] Speaker 1: But she can pantomime.

[00:54:00] Speaker 36: Utility f- uh, familiar sort of.

[00:54:02] Speaker 34: Yeah.

[00:54:03] Speaker 1: Kind of like that.

[00:54:04] Speaker 35: (laughs)

[00:54:05] Speaker 36: A helpful friend who doesn't help in combat.

[00:54:08] Speaker 35: Yeah.

[00:54:08] Speaker 1: Yeah, these guys are so small they're not going to be much use to her.

[00:54:11] Speaker 36: It's good they are. A living bag of holding. Super useful.

[00:54:15] Speaker 35: (laughs)

[00:54:16] Speaker 33: Yep.

[00:54:17] Speaker 1: Um, so I'm gonna just clear off some stuff real quick.

[00:54:20] Speaker 35: More storage space is always good.

[00:54:23] Speaker 1: So you guys continue on down, um, throughout the forest. They're guiding you about. Um, let's see, do we need YouTube? We use Yergi for tonight because I haven't quite figured out a miniature for Kent yet. Trying to match the craziness in that photo is proving to be a little harder than-

[00:54:41] Speaker 33: Yeah, right?

[00:54:42] Speaker 1: I have an idea, but it's going to be a conversion job.

[00:54:45] Speaker 38: They don't have minis that just have that hairstyle?

[00:54:48] Speaker 1: (laughs)

[00:54:48] Speaker 39: I know. It's a pretty common one, yeah.

[00:54:50] Speaker 1: See, I found... Here, let me show you a quick one.

[00:54:53] Speaker 39: See my original image... Do you remember, like, Conan the Barbarian, the 1982 version?

[00:54:58] Speaker 1: (laughs) You can go to Hero Forge-

[00:54:59] Speaker 39: Like, at the very end, the wizard?

[00:55:01] Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the 4K feature now, where like if they design something you can just get, like, the-

[00:55:06] Speaker 38: Oh, okay. Yeah. He's just, like, crusty, old, like, frail, like, wizard.

[00:55:12] Speaker 1: You can print it yourself.

[00:55:12] Speaker 40: I've got his figure going there. It shouldn't be as high resolution, but it will be as high detailed. You probably could find it otherwise.

[00:55:20] Speaker 39: So, like, ugh, there's a fight and they take of his old armor so he's just running around in this really oversized, mismatched armor, but he looks like he's, like, just drowning in. That was kinda, like, the vision I had.

[00:55:30] Speaker 38: Oh, that's the origin.

[00:55:31] Speaker 39: Like, this old crazy guy.

[00:55:32] Speaker 38: Okay. Yeah.

[00:55:34] Speaker 39: What kind of armor are you wearing?

[00:55:36] Speaker 38: Uh, scale mail.

[00:55:37] Speaker 1: There it is right here. Here, let me show you. I found, like, the...

[00:55:41] Speaker 39: But I couldn't find anything remotely close to that, so.

[00:55:48] Speaker 1: Okay, well, goddamn. Maybe it's not there anymore. Here's another version of Yurgi that I found right there.

[00:55:53] Speaker 39: Oh, yeah.

[00:55:53] Speaker 1: It could be your character as well, but... Well, I'll find him eventually. Put it in the cart, now I... There we go. I found a crazy scientist which the head looks like your guy, but the rest of the body doesn't, so.

[00:56:04] Speaker 38: Yeah, I found one. The head was pretty close, but he had goggles on which fits Doc Brown, but, I mean, not like a sci-fi Doc Brown.

[00:56:13] Speaker 1: Yeah. Let's see. We'll take you guys out, you're going through the forest a ways. Um, and eventually you start hearing some, uh, screeching coming off in the distance. And running up to you, um, probably at about 40 or 50 feet you can see, um, look to be some boars who look to be fairly agitated and they're charging almost right in your direction. So, pull this off and get that drawn and you can roll initiative if you want to. And you can pull if you wanna put in two boar for now.

[00:56:56] Speaker 38: What's your character's name again? Did we ask your name? I don't remember.

[00:56:59] Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, don't mind. You can also give them, you see his photo if you want a description or... You have a moment as you're walking through the forest if you do want to tell them anything or other fun stuff like that.

[00:57:08] Speaker 41: All right. You can call him Alrik. I'm a grinnolf gribblesag.

[00:57:15] Speaker 1: It's A-L-R-I-K.

[00:57:17] Speaker 41: Thank you. That was going to be my question.

[00:57:19] Speaker 1: (laughs) I, I typed it into the database before we started.

[00:57:26] Speaker 41: Don't worry.

[00:57:28] Speaker 1: What was I doing? Hero Lab. Hero Lab it is.

[00:57:31] Speaker 39: So, yeah. I mean, he's, uh, he's wearing some really old-fashioned looking armor and he's got a bunch of little, like a bunch of odd stuff attached to him and his big bulky backpack. He's carrying a big, like, pole in one hand and he's got a big sword in the other hand. Well, I guess it... Well, I guess he'd have to try. I think they got shield.

[00:57:55] Speaker 38: Uh, Kotal, initiative.

[00:57:57] Speaker 42: 19.

[00:57:59] Speaker 39: He's got crazy ass hair.

[00:58:00] Speaker 42: Yeah, they don't even have crazy hair.

[00:58:03] Speaker 39: Yeah. Oh, what's my perception? Oh, 10.

[00:58:18] Speaker 1: Okay.

[00:58:43] Speaker 39: That's a pretty good mini of Yurgi though.

[00:58:45] Speaker 1: Yep. Ugh. I found weird one online maybe I'll keep that guy in front of us too. Here, we'll throw some trees over here. So you guys kind of have a little bit of a path that kind of winds through. Yeah, we'll use some bushes too. And they fall down.

[00:59:13] Speaker 39: What was that?

[00:59:14] Speaker 1: One fell down.

[00:59:15] Speaker 39: Oh.

[00:59:16] Speaker 1: But these things are hollow and fairly durable. You notice this is kind of a fairly typical, you know, pine forest for the most part. So you guys... Oh, hang on. The Fayem have their miniatures but I don't bother putting them on 'cause they're not really...

[00:59:40] Speaker 38: 20 seconds.

[00:59:43] Speaker 1: Now, whatever you guys can put yourself whenever-

[00:59:45] Speaker 38: 20 seconds to the one hour mark.

[00:59:46] Speaker 1: ... or if you want to-

[00:59:50] Speaker 40: (humming) That works for me.

[00:59:56] Speaker 42: Five less feet to walk.

[00:59:58] Speaker 41: Oh, yeah. Ancestors! And I go into a rage.

[01:00:02] Speaker 42: Uh, it's one hour.

[01:00:04] Speaker 1: Okay. Go ahead and roll a dice since you guys haven't had much use to them. (laughs)

[01:00:08] Speaker 42: 14.

[01:00:10] Speaker 38: 11.

[01:00:11] Speaker 39: 18.

[01:00:11] Speaker 42: Winner, winner, chicken dinner.

[01:00:14] Speaker 39: Thank you.

[01:00:17] Speaker 1: There was also a thing I maybe we should house, Ruel, that if you roll your dice on your re-roll, if you roll a five or less, you can roll again 'cause it really sucks to have a worse than a five.

[01:00:28] Speaker 39: Yeah. I thought about that in my last campaign, but, but I didn't wanna change a big campaign that... It sucks to roll, like, even worse, so. I thought about changing it this time.

[01:00:38] Speaker 1: Well, I mean, five or less is a good rule 'cause, like, if you use a hero point when you rolled a nine, well, then you're kind of gambling 'cause you already had average.

[01:00:45] Speaker 39: Yeah.

[01:00:46] Speaker 1: Um, go further.

[01:00:48] Speaker 39: But there should be some kind of lower end to it.

[01:00:51] Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah. So, like, you had a nine and you got a six, well, you just lost.

[01:00:55] Speaker 43: Had a nine and you get a five, you can roll again.

[01:01:06] Speaker 44: Too much crap on the table. All right. Uh, I got to remember what my character can do here.

[01:01:17] Speaker 1: Okay. One boar is going to be a 10 and the other, an 18.

[01:01:24] Speaker 44: Okay.

[01:01:25] Speaker 1: Um, the one that's higher, you can just label A, and the one that's lower B. And I will... Or one and two, sorry.

[01:01:33] Speaker 44: Stop changing your mind. (laughs)

[01:01:35] Speaker 1: He has numeric basis.

[01:01:36] Speaker 44: Yeah.

[01:01:39] Speaker 1: Or colors. Really gets technical, red one and red two. If they live that long. Okay, who's up? Who's-

[01:01:52] Speaker 44: Um, first is Goatal with a 19. Boar one is on deck. They're very far away.

[01:02:01] Speaker 1: They are far away.

[01:02:01] Speaker 44: They are far away.

[01:02:07] Speaker 1: Well, just-

[01:02:08] Speaker 44: They've got to be about 180 feet away.

[01:02:10] Speaker 1: You'll probably see a lot of the adventurers will kind of start off at a little bit more of a distance. They always hate it when you start off six, you know, 30 feet away all the time.

[01:02:17] Speaker 43: I am moving there and parrying.

[01:02:20] Speaker 1: Parry, oh. Uh, boar one you said?

[01:02:23] Speaker 44: Yep. Uh, Alri... Well, Alric and boar two tied. I don't know how we do monsters-

[01:02:28] Speaker 1: Monsters always win.

[01:02:29] Speaker 44: Okay.

[01:02:29] Speaker 1: There's actually a feat you take on proved initiative and then that says you win if you tie.

[01:02:33] Speaker 44: Yeah. Um, both boars are now.

[01:02:36] Speaker 1: Oh, both boars. Okay.

[01:02:37] Speaker 44: Boar one technically first, yeah. 10 o'clock on deck.

[01:02:41] Speaker 1: Mm-hmm. Yeah. 14, um, so that'll be 120 for efficacy. It runs a little sideways there, this one.

[01:03:10] Speaker 44: You ever seen a video of like an actual pack of wild boars attacking?

[01:03:15] Speaker 43: Mm, I've never seen a wild boar in a video at all. Other than fake shit, like you know-

[01:03:23] Speaker 1: Oh, yeah. Let me get this right about that.

[01:03:25] Speaker 43: ... Game of Thrones. They care about that. (laughs)

[01:03:26] Speaker 1: It's not as far as it gets.

[01:03:27] Speaker 43: Killed the king.

[01:03:28] Speaker 1: They both just run around.

[01:03:32] Speaker 44: Next.

[01:03:33] Speaker 43: Googly moogly.

[01:03:36] Speaker 44: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 50, 55, 60. If I can see him. Uh, what is my speed again? Yeah, line of sight. Yep.

[01:04:03] Speaker 43: (coughs) Come here, Mr. Bacon. And I'm gonna cast a spell at him.

[01:04:19] Speaker 1: Red one?

[01:04:21] Speaker 43: Yeah, red one. Oh, come on. Where is it? Okay, plus eight. I'm going to cast needle darts at him. Uh, 19.

[01:04:45] Speaker 1: That hits.

[01:04:47] Speaker 43: All right. 3D4. Five. That's disappointing.

[01:05:01] Speaker 1: Okay, I'm moving as well.

[01:05:03] Speaker 43: Yep.

[01:05:03] Speaker 1: Okay, next up.

[01:05:04] Speaker 43: Yeah.

[01:05:05] Speaker 1: Oh, that's just, that'll be you.

[01:05:07] Speaker 43: Yep. All right. Uh, one action move and the other action for that, it's called sudden charge. Yeah, sudden charge. So, move and attack him.

[01:05:19] Speaker 1: Yeah, I saw a video once of, uh, I think it was down by... Down in Texas. They have this huge wild boar problem with like, herds like 30, 40 at a time. And they just started charging at these guys-

[01:05:32] Speaker 43: 19 down.

[01:05:32] Speaker 1: ... in the woods.

[01:05:33] Speaker 44: 19 hits.

[01:05:34] Speaker 43: Uh, they're, they're coming to the, uh... And it was just like, one after another.

[01:05:38] Speaker 44: Yeah.

[01:05:38] Speaker 43: There's just these giant boars-

[01:05:40] Speaker 44: Seven bludgeoning and three spears.

[01:05:41] Speaker 43: There's like four or five guys.

[01:05:42] Speaker 45: Three together.

[01:05:43] Speaker 43: They're out there hunting with AR-15s.

[01:05:45] Speaker 1: On top of the order-

[01:05:46] Speaker 43: But it's like whoa.

[01:05:46] Speaker 1: Three new things enter the initiative.

[01:05:49] Speaker 43: Three more?

[01:05:51] Speaker 45: Three new things.

[01:05:54] Speaker 1: These are weird little, um, vine-y like creatures. Um, you can just call 'em vine.

[01:06:02] Speaker 45: (laughs)

[01:06:02] Speaker 1: We'll call 'em green one, two and three. How about? They look somewhat menacing. Oh, no. Actually you changed that, only two.

[01:06:25] Speaker 43: 'Cause that's all we painted.

[01:06:28] Speaker 44: (laughs)

[01:06:29] Speaker 1: Uh, I got a bunch of these guys. I just thought I had three. So green one and green two. No green... Green three dies on the vine for this thing.

[01:06:36] Speaker 43: Oh my god. Ba dum bum.

[01:06:39] Speaker 44: (laughs) Terrible.

[01:06:41] Speaker 1: So they appear. Um, and those... They'll appear and then they'll go into initiative order. Um, so one is not that interested.First section. So 13 for one and well, 11 for eight, or for two.

[01:07:08] Speaker 39: Okay. Kotal is still first.

[01:07:09] Speaker 1: And the top of the order.

[01:07:11] Speaker 46: Oh.

[01:07:12] Speaker 39: Uh, then it's the...

[01:07:15] Speaker 46: Basically boars.

[01:07:16] Speaker 39: All the monsters.

[01:07:18] Speaker 1: They even beat you guys out?

[01:07:20] Speaker 39: Yep.

[01:07:21] Speaker 46: Wow.

[01:07:22] Speaker 39: I rolled low and the boar too, tied with Kotal.

[01:07:24] Speaker 1: Oh.

[01:07:25] Speaker 39: I was the lowest monster.

[01:07:27] Speaker 46: So my turn?

[01:07:27] Speaker 39: Yeah.

[01:07:27] Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

[01:07:29] Speaker 46: Move me two towards that boar.

[01:07:34] Speaker 39: You got reach?

[01:07:36] Speaker 46: Yeah.

[01:07:36] Speaker 39: Cool.

[01:07:38] Speaker 1: Yeah, thing about the bow stuff has natural reach, doesn't it?

[01:07:40] Speaker 39: Yeah.

[01:07:41] Speaker 1: Because lance, sorta steer.

[01:07:45] Speaker 46: Uh, that's probably a miss. It's almost certainly a miss. And almost certainly a miss. You can have nine and nine.

[01:07:54] Speaker 1: Ah, yeah, the answer is nine for that attack.

[01:07:57] Speaker 39: Nine then.

[01:07:58] Speaker 46: Uh- And parry for the third action.

[01:08:00] Speaker 39: Parry? Okay.

[01:08:01] Speaker 46: Next is boar one, green one, green two and boar two.

[01:08:04] Speaker 1: (laughs)

[01:08:04] Speaker 39: Aurek's on deck.

[01:08:06] Speaker 1: Boar one, since he just got clobbered, is gonna turn. He's gonna try to bore you or gore you, I suppose.

[01:08:14] Speaker 39: Uh- The boar will gore. Let's see. "Oh, hey there fat one. I look forward to eating your remains." (dice rolling)

[01:08:25] Speaker 1: Um, gonna be a 21.

[01:08:27] Speaker 39: Oh, fuck you. Yeah, that hits. (laughs) Our level what-

[01:08:32] Speaker 1: Why does it have to go-

[01:08:32] Speaker 39: ... doesn't distinguish the hit us. (laughs)

[01:08:33] Speaker 1: Yeah, they go 2D6 minus two plus four. Love that.

[01:08:37] Speaker 39: Why is it minus two plus four? (laughs)

[01:08:39] Speaker 1: (laughs) These ones are actually the weaker version so I'm guessing it... There's a nice thing on there if you... There's a mo- um, with ar- nar- uh, Arcan and Nethis where you can assign monsters weak, strong... Weak, normal and strong.

[01:08:52] Speaker 39: Mm-hmm.

[01:08:52] Speaker 1: And it'll do the, uh, the stat adjustments. That's probably a stat adjustment. But it's weird that it puts it that way.

[01:08:56] Speaker 39: Yeah.

[01:08:57] Speaker 1: Yes, it did. So that would be 11 points of damage.

[01:09:00] Speaker 39: Okay.

[01:09:02] Speaker 1: It butts you like that. Um, it'll take a second attack, why not? Um,: (dice rolling) and that's gonna miss on that. Then it's just gonna turn in terror and continue running. So, um, if you have a free of attack opportunity, I don't know if you'd-

[01:09:17] Speaker 39: No, I do not.

[01:09:17] Speaker 1: ... get it yet. Um-

[01:09:19] Speaker 39: Some variants never get it.

[01:09:21] Speaker 46: You can.

[01:09:21] Speaker 39: I don't.

[01:09:22] Speaker 1: It's an optional-

[01:09:22] Speaker 39: It's a fee.

[01:09:23] Speaker 1: ... six level fee.

[01:09:23] Speaker 39: Yeah.

[01:09:24] Speaker 46: Mm-hmm.

[01:09:24] Speaker 1: That you had as, uh... Well, I think that was an arc type one.

[01:09:29] Speaker 46: Oh.

[01:09:30] Speaker 1: I gotta... I think they get some. They do get a few things though. They get like one where they could get a free move to follow whatever this...

[01:09:36] Speaker 39: It's okay.

[01:09:37] Speaker 46: I remember there was a fee you could take at six level. I don't get mine until I take, what's it called?

[01:09:43] Speaker 39: Six, like that.

[01:09:44] Speaker 46: Standstill?

[01:09:46] Speaker 39: Oh, yeah. That, uh-

[01:09:47] Speaker 46: One thing?

[01:09:48] Speaker 39: Movement phase one. Yeah. Moment of that.

[01:09:50] Speaker 1: One, two, three, four, five, seven, eight. You're in his way, so he's gonna charge you. Um-

[01:10:05] Speaker 46: I think these were prey.

[01:10:08] Speaker 39: Mm-hmm.

[01:10:09] Speaker 46: Kotal will stay out-

[01:10:10] Speaker 1: Try, he can make a trusted team.

[01:10:12] Speaker 39: Well, I'm sorry. They couldn't have been our prey. Get back here, you boars.

[01:10:16] Speaker 46: We must, we must deal with the hunters.

[01:10:20] Speaker 1: Well, that was a...

[01:10:21] Speaker 39: Mm-hmm.

[01:10:23] Speaker 1: That'd only be a 13 to hit.

[01:10:25] Speaker 39: That is going to be-

[01:10:25] Speaker 1: On the other hand, boar-

[01:10:26] Speaker 39: (laughs)

[01:10:26] Speaker 1: That would be all... Well, it has one extra action. It'll... So it gets two moves and an attack, so... Oh, no. It moved then it did that attack. So it has one more free action. It'll just take another attack for the heck of it and it'll miss horribly with that. These little guys are covered in little spineys and they are... (hums) They have a movement speed somewhere in here. Somewhere right here. Don't know where it is. (footsteps thudding) Oh, there we go. It's, uh, it's bottom. Good grief.

[01:11:22] Speaker 39: Hmm.

[01:11:24] Speaker 1: So basically four, one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four, four, four, four. Same thing. That's all they can do.

[01:11:36] Speaker 39: Not the fastest.

[01:11:37] Speaker 1: Yeah, they're kinda slow.

[01:11:38] Speaker 39: All right, uh, Aurek's next.

[01:11:40] Speaker 1: They're kind of shambling you guys away.

[01:11:44] Speaker 47: (Upbeat music playing)

[01:11:46] Speaker 39: Okay. Well, I've got this giant boar ass attacking me. I might as well drop my 10-foot pole and we'll try to whack this thing two-handed. (dramatic music playing) Uh, oh, my bastard, it might, that, that kind of sucks. Maybe I don't wanna do that. Uh, (laughs) thir- 14, which I'm sure he's gonna miss.

[01:12:12] Speaker 1: Um, against the boar, that would hit.

[01:12:14] Speaker 39: Really? They don't have armor.

[01:12:16] Speaker 1: You're at 30.

[01:12:16] Speaker 39: Okay.

[01:12:17] Speaker 1: No. It's just for armor, it does.

[01:12:19] Speaker 39: Yeah, I still thought that was gonna be a little (laughs) low but okay. Uh, it's nine points.

[01:12:25] Speaker 1: Okay, that's a good crack.

[01:12:26] Speaker 39: Well, let's swing again then. Uh, it's gonna be 15.

[01:12:32] Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

[01:12:33] Speaker 39: That's gonna be five points.

[01:12:39] Speaker 1: One more, two actions.

[01:12:40] Speaker 39: That's it. Guard mine, sorry.

[01:12:41] Speaker 1: Oh, oh. Next up.

[01:12:45] Speaker 46: Oh, you drew a sword.

[01:12:46] Speaker 39: I thought I had it, but I, uh, had it-

[01:12:48] Speaker 46: I thought you were holding it, had sudden charge. Hitting him with a staff. I misheard.

[01:12:53] Speaker 39: Nope, not a staff this, 10-foot pole.

[01:12:55] Speaker 46: Okay.

[01:12:56] Speaker 39: Which are really long staff.

[01:12:58] Speaker 46: Sure.

[01:12:59] Speaker 39: But, uh, yeah. Drop it so then you gotta use an action to grab a, 25, 20.

[01:13:04] Speaker 46: Now you know the counts.

[01:13:04] Speaker 1: That is a grit.

[01:13:05] Speaker 39: Sweet. Mm-hmm.

[01:13:09] Speaker 48: Um... although I'm really bad at it, so maybe I'm not going to. (laughs) Uh, 30 bludgeoning and 6 spirit.

[01:13:20] Speaker 49: (laughs)

[01:13:21] Speaker 50: (coughs) Yeah, you, um, finish him off pretty convincingly.

[01:13:26] Speaker 48: Woo!

[01:13:27] Speaker 50: However you wanted that to end.

[01:13:28] Speaker 48: Just smash it in a way that is mostly in the head that leaves the hide alone, so we can get some meat out of it. Here, Becky, Becky. Mm-hmm. Uh, third action, is there a limit on intimidating people? Like range-wise?

[01:13:44] Speaker 50: You can only intimidate this, um-

[01:13:45] Speaker 48: You mean range?

[01:13:46] Speaker 50: ... one, yeah, s- s- s- 30? I can't remember.

[01:13:51] Speaker 48: Yeah, 30 feet.

[01:13:52] Speaker 51: Yeah.

[01:13:52] Speaker 48: So they're way out of my range.

[01:13:54] Speaker 50: All right, uh, I'll let you move. I'm gonna grab some water real quick.

[01:13:58] Speaker 52: Can I bother you for a refill?

[01:14:00] Speaker 50: Ah, yeah. Sure.

[01:14:01] Speaker 52: Five, 10, 15.

[01:14:03] Speaker 50: Yep, okay.

[01:14:04] Speaker 52: Thank you. That is my turn. Next is you. (footsteps thudding)

[01:14:17] Speaker 2: I'm good to go.

[01:14:20] Speaker 50: Mm-hmm. Guard?

[01:14:25] Speaker 2: Uh, parry and ready an attack if they come in range. Ready flurry of blows, if they come in range.

[01:14:32] Speaker 48: What if I ranged?

[01:14:34] Speaker 2: Then I will not be able to use my flurry of blows.

[01:14:37] Speaker 48: You know, it's funny, but I was-

[01:14:39] Speaker 52: Well, I'm guessing what you are from what you're saying, but are you using any weapons?

[01:14:43] Speaker 2: Uh, staff.

[01:14:44] Speaker 52: And you?

[01:14:45] Speaker 48: Uh, I'm using a maul. I did shout and go into some sort of angry fever once initiative kicked off, so I can guess what you are too, but-

[01:14:59] Speaker 52: Yeah. Um, what are you wearing for armor?

[01:15:02] Speaker 48: A medium, uh, breastplate I think.

[01:15:04] Speaker 52: Okay. Yeah, breastplate.

[01:15:08] Speaker 2: Loose-fitting clothing.

[01:15:10] Speaker 48: Okay. Yeah, I can-

[01:15:12] Speaker 2: But not Yurky level of nudeness.

[01:15:14] Speaker 48: Right.

[01:15:15] Speaker 2: Like it's covering things, it's just loose and so that I can move freely.

[01:15:19] Speaker 52: I figured.

[01:15:20] Speaker 48: (laughs)

[01:15:21] Speaker 52: 'Cause I can guess what you are.

[01:15:23] Speaker 48: Like was Yurky a former character?

[01:15:25] Speaker 52: Yeah. Yeah, it was one of Craig's, um-

[01:15:26] Speaker 2: He's a 80, 80-year-old r- r- randy old guy who wore only a loin cloth out of principle.

[01:15:34] Speaker 48: Woo!

[01:15:34] Speaker 52: And hated his kids.

[01:15:36] Speaker 48: Hated his kids.

[01:15:36] Speaker 49: Principle.

[01:15:36] Speaker 48: Yep. It was an old school Viking.

[01:15:38] Speaker 52: Hated his kids, so he-

[01:15:40] Speaker 2: Uh, uh, uh, so it was my turn. My turn was to ready a parry and ready a flurry of blows if they came into range.

[01:15:48] Speaker 50: Well, I tell you, you can parry, two, prepare two things, can you?

[01:15:51] Speaker 2: Parry is, uh, uh, right, flurry of blows is one action.

[01:15:55] Speaker 50: Oh, okay. He asked you that with two-

[01:15:56] Speaker 2: So it is a, it is a one action-

[01:15:58] Speaker 50: Well, you could ready that, but could you ready parry?

[01:16:01] Speaker 2: I didn't ready, I just parried.

[01:16:03] Speaker 50: Oh, you just parried, okay. I see what you mean.

[01:16:06] Speaker 2: Parry, parry just costs an action and increases my armor class by one.

[01:16:08] Speaker 50: Okay, I thought you ready to parry, and I was trying to think-

[01:16:10] Speaker 2: No, I parried and then readied a flurry of blows.

[01:16:13] Speaker 50: Oh, gosh. Okay. Um, so let's see-

[01:16:15] Speaker 2: I took a defensive stance and then prepared for something to come within range.

[01:16:19] Speaker 50: Dinner is off the table.

[01:16:21] Speaker 48: Four, two in the grid.

[01:16:23] Speaker 50: Dinner two, he's gonna try to just run through Kent.

[01:16:27] Speaker 52: Trample.

[01:16:30] Speaker 2: Do that.

[01:16:32] Speaker 50: Mm.

[01:16:33] Speaker 2: Magic: The Gathering.

[01:16:35] Speaker 50: What's that?

[01:16:36] Speaker 2: Trample.

[01:16:37] Speaker 50: Oh, yeah.

[01:16:37] Speaker 2: (laughs)

[01:16:38] Speaker 50: Um, he would have a 16.

[01:16:44] Speaker 48: Yep.

[01:16:44] Speaker 50: Yeah. Um, let's see, that would be-

[01:16:47] Speaker 48: Back to where you needed.

[01:16:48] Speaker 50: ... 11 points of damage.

[01:16:50] Speaker 48: Okay.

[01:16:51] Speaker 50: He'll headbutt you again. He's, he's trying to just ru- Over you or-

[01:16:57] Speaker 48: Bang!

[01:16:57] Speaker 50: ... through you.

[01:16:58] Speaker 48: He did the legs.

[01:16:59] Speaker 50: That's not so good. That's only a nine. So seeing as how he can't get the mountain of human out of the way, he's just going to move. So he moves up to there. (clears throat) How are you looking?

[01:17:14] Speaker 48: Old, crazy hair.

[01:17:16] Speaker 50: Mm-hmm.

[01:17:17] Speaker 48: Bottleneck.

[01:17:19] Speaker 50: Oh, next up, where's his own healing ability?

[01:17:21] Speaker 48: Uh, the greens. I don't know. And, uh, some Aurics on deck after the greens. Refresh my memory. Does stamina go first or hit points?

[01:17:33] Speaker 50: Stamina.

[01:17:33] Speaker 48: It should take stamina first time out.

[01:17:34] Speaker 2: Always take the damage away from stamina and Hero Lab will do the right thing.

[01:17:37] Speaker 48: Oh, nice.

[01:17:40] Speaker 50: He will move up to you. Well, actually once he gets to here, um, you have to take a, uh...

[01:17:45] Speaker 48: Well, if he has his ready action out, it would kick him.

[01:17:47] Speaker 50: Well, it's gonna in there a moment. Well, they're gonna happen at the same time.

[01:17:50] Speaker 52: I did better. Hm?

[01:17:52] Speaker 2: As soon as he steps in the square, my reaction triggers.

[01:17:56] Speaker 48: Yeah.

[01:17:56] Speaker 2: Unless he's to actually step. No, it doesn't. I said in range. This is not attack of opportunity.

[01:18:02] Speaker 48: But is it like an aura that kicks in?

[01:18:05] Speaker 50: He has an aura, so I'm just going-

[01:18:06] Speaker 2: Oh, well, no that... Yeah, that's... My thing happens at the end of his action.

[01:18:10] Speaker 48: If he has an aura?

[01:18:10] Speaker 50: So go ahead and take a, uh-

[01:18:12] Speaker 48: Is that when he has an aura?

[01:18:12] Speaker 2: Yes.

[01:18:14] Speaker 50: Hm. Some kind of save.

[01:18:18] Speaker 48: Yeah. Re, re, run.

[01:18:21] Speaker 50: Fort save.

[01:18:22] Speaker 2: It's bad, 10.

[01:18:24] Speaker 48: Yeah.

[01:18:24] Speaker 50: Okay, you-

[01:18:25] Speaker 48: You got hit once?

[01:18:26] Speaker 2: No. Mm. Slogged away.

[01:18:28] Speaker 50: ... are flatfooted-

[01:18:30] Speaker 52: (laughs)

[01:18:31] Speaker 50: ... for one hour.

[01:18:32] Speaker 52: Never!

[01:18:33] Speaker 48: For one hour?

[01:18:34] Speaker 50: One round.

[01:18:35] Speaker 48: Okay. Okay.

[01:18:35] Speaker 2: Yeah. Yeah.

[01:18:36] Speaker 50: And then he finishes off his action right there. That's his entire turn.

[01:18:39] Speaker 48: Well, yeah.

[01:18:40] Speaker 50: Oh, yeah, now you're-

[01:18:40] Speaker 2: It would've interrupted him before he went there.

[01:18:44] Speaker 50: That is, uh, 26.

[01:18:48] Speaker 48: That will hit. That is number one.

[01:18:52] Speaker 50: Now seven points of damage on the first swing and the back swing is, that's 18.

[01:19:02] Speaker 48: That will still hit.

[01:19:04] Speaker 50: Which is, uh, 11 points of damage. (footsteps thudding)

[01:19:11] Speaker 1: Okay. And it was all of his turn to get up there. All right. This one, one, two, three, four. One, two, three, four is all he can do. That does it for them.

[01:19:26] Speaker 53: Okay. All right.

[01:19:27] Speaker 1: Um, you are already failed, so his aura is this kind of really noxious aura that comes over, um, as if these things, um, smell like rotting stuff. Best way to put it. Rotting dead stuff.

[01:19:41] Speaker 54: But they look like, they look like plants?

[01:19:42] Speaker 1: Yeah, for the most part.

[01:19:45] Speaker 53: Hmm, well that's not very good range. Do they look like rotting plants?

[01:19:56] Speaker 54: About 35 and... 35 and 40 feet away from you.

[01:19:59] Speaker 1: Kind of.

[01:20:05] Speaker 53: I'm going to blast this dude. My Stendarr's hearing ads. Take this, you fiend.

[01:20:14] Speaker 54: You sure he's not Yergi?

[01:20:17] Speaker 53: Nope.

[01:20:18] Speaker 54: He keeps like referring to Mads.

[01:20:20] Speaker 53: That was the first time. Are you blaspheming against Stendarr?

[01:20:27] Speaker 1: He seems uncouth.

[01:20:29] Speaker 53: Blaspheming. (laughs) He's a cranky old man.

[01:20:32] Speaker 1: You missed.

[01:20:32] Speaker 53: I missed, awfully.

[01:20:34] Speaker 1: Oh, did you switch to Stendarr?

[01:20:36] Speaker 53: That's what... Oh.

[01:20:37] Speaker 1: Talas is what you're looking at.

[01:20:39] Speaker 53: Oh yeah. Talas is Harry Mads. (laughs) Him too. But I missed. I'm assuming it's all I missed.

[01:20:47] Speaker 1: I know. Talas is all Mads.

[01:20:48] Speaker 53: Is that a spell or a...

[01:20:50] Speaker 1: That's a spell.

[01:20:50] Speaker 53: Oh, okay. So, it still leaves you one action, if you had one. Uh, nope, that's all I'm gonna do.

[01:20:58] Speaker 1: Okay. Next up, me. Uh...

[01:21:03] Speaker 53: Yeah, I was just thinking it was still Stendarr, but you're right, I did change to Talas. Five, 15, 20 and what can I check?

[01:21:17] Speaker 1: Uh, four to two.

[01:21:18] Speaker 53: Four to two before he fails.

[01:21:20] Speaker 1: So I have to make two of them?

[01:21:21] Speaker 53: Um-

[01:21:22] Speaker 1: You didn't make any two.

[01:21:24] Speaker 53: ... well 'cause you already failed.

[01:21:25] Speaker 1: I think if you make one you have to. Unless you failed and then you don't have to.

[01:21:29] Speaker 54: Well, well actually, what if you pass it, you won't have to take any more for a little bit.

[01:21:33] Speaker 53: Yeah that's what I was wondering, like if you're immune after a little bit.

[01:21:35] Speaker 54: Yeah, so you pass the first one you don't have to.

[01:21:37] Speaker 53: Okay. Uh, 26.

[01:21:38] Speaker 54: And if you fail the first one then you still don't have to. So... (coughing) so you're perfectly fine.

[01:21:45] Speaker 53: Okay, cool. I will smash him. Um, that is, um, uh, 16 to hit. Um, with flank.

[01:21:57] Speaker 1: With flank is 18, which hits.

[01:21:59] Speaker 53: Yay. Uh, six bludgeoning, three spirit.

[01:22:08] Speaker 1: Not looking so hot.

[01:22:09] Speaker 53: Um, do you have another action or not?

[01:22:11] Speaker 1: Yeah. Is that one you're attacking?

[01:22:13] Speaker 53: Yeah, I'm attacking.

[01:22:14] Speaker 54: The flanked one.

[01:22:15] Speaker 53: Yep, that's what I figured. I don't want to waste an action trying to intimidate if they don't speak English common, whatever. Uh, yeah, eight's not going to hit. That's my turn.

[01:22:28] Speaker 54: You had intimidating there though, didn't you? Yeah.

[01:22:30] Speaker 53: No, I don't have that yet.

[01:22:31] Speaker 54: Oh, yeah. Okay.

[01:22:32] Speaker 53: I probably will get it, but not yet.

[01:22:34] Speaker 55: What's, uh... Who's next?

[01:22:35] Speaker 53: Uh, that's you. Go tall.

[01:22:37] Speaker 1: Yep. The moment you've been waiting for.

[01:22:42] Speaker 53: Uh, do I need to save every round since I... It wore off?

[01:22:45] Speaker 1: Mm-hmm. You failed, it'll wear off.

[01:22:47] Speaker 53: But then do I have to do it again because I'm still standing in the aura?

[01:22:49] Speaker 1: I think it's for your next turn. Let me see.

[01:22:50] Speaker 53: Okay, well.

[01:22:53] Speaker 1: You're flat-footed for one round, so... Yeah, it's at the end, at the end of your turn.

[01:22:57] Speaker 53: Okay, we'll do that. I'll roll at the end of my turn. I'm going to...

[01:23:00] Speaker 1: Oh, it automatically ends, so yeah, you're fine.

[01:23:02] Speaker 53: Yeah. I'm, I'm still standing in it. It's... Oh. It doesn't repeat until I succeed? I would have guessed.

[01:23:08] Speaker 1: Oh, it's if it exceeds its fail, it's... Yeah.

[01:23:10] Speaker 54: A lot of times

[01:23:10] Speaker 56: You'd have to mute for a minute or something like that too, otherwise.

[01:23:12] Speaker 1: Well, anyway. So, so I will swing my staff up towards the side of this creature's head. This is a friend. Whoa, friends. Easy with that staff. That is, uh, 13.

[01:23:28] Speaker 54: That one missed.

[01:23:32] Speaker 1: Well, that's definitely an miss.

[01:23:33] Speaker 53: Um, third action I will go again 'cause I don't have enough other tools yet. We're getting them out. We're getting them out of the way.

[01:23:47] Speaker 1: (laughs)

[01:23:48] Speaker 53: Um, and then, and then, uh, Perry for an extra three. Press the double ones.

[01:23:53] Speaker 1: Oh, I didn't even see. Now it's green one and two.

[01:23:58] Speaker 53: Oh, no. I'm, I'm not flat-footed anymore, except I'm definitely not. 19 plus.

[01:24:05] Speaker 1: One, these things are... Oh, bore two also, if it's still in play. Squeeze.

[01:24:10] Speaker 53: They were being hunted, I suspect.

[01:24:12] Speaker 1: You guys, if you did a... Well, you got that E. Yeah, we don't know, it's supposed to get to them when he killed them. Um, he will five foot over and attack, uh, you. Well, actually let's see here. Even, odd. Odd, he steps that way.

[01:24:27] Speaker 53: Rude.

[01:24:28] Speaker 1: Actually, he would probably just walk that way.

[01:24:29] Speaker 54: That's not funny.

[01:24:30] Speaker 1: Yeah, he needs to go all the way, just like...

[01:24:33] Speaker 53: Uh-oh, getting really rude.

[01:24:34] Speaker 1: I don't know if they're smart enough to know you guys could have a attack of opportunity or not, so... But he's just gonna do it.

[01:24:38] Speaker 53: But I don't have it yet, so.

[01:24:40] Speaker 1: It's all, uh, all for these guys. So, he moves there. Okay, so I might do a few different things. Okay, that doesn't really matter. So, he's going to give you a vinin.

[01:25:01] Speaker 53: A vinin? Oh, no. I hardly know you. Give me the venimo.

[01:25:10] Speaker 1: Ooh, it's a crip.

[01:25:11] Speaker 53: (laughs) He definitely is giving you venomo. (laughs)

[01:25:14] Speaker 48: I already took pretty decent board damage, so this-

[01:25:18] Speaker 57: Did you? (laughs)

[01:25:18] Speaker 48: Mm-hmm.

[01:25:18] Speaker 58: That hurt.

[01:25:19] Speaker 48: Yeah. It's might hurt.

[01:25:20] Speaker 1: We went down a lot last week, 'cause we're level one.

[01:25:22] Speaker 48: Yeah.

[01:25:23] Speaker 1: And forgot what it was like to be level 12.

[01:25:24] Speaker 58: 12 all together.

[01:25:25] Speaker 48: Sucks. (laughs)

[01:25:25] Speaker 58: I'm still alive.

[01:25:27] Speaker 48: Mm.

[01:25:27] Speaker 58: Doesn't take much. Barely.

[01:25:29] Speaker 1: It's good-

[01:25:30] Speaker 48: And-

[01:25:30] Speaker 1: ... 'cause, uh, going down on a crit-

[01:25:31] Speaker 58: You got a second attack.

[01:25:33] Speaker 48: He's dying two instead of dying one.

[01:25:34] Speaker 58: Is that another crit? (laughs)

[01:25:36] Speaker 1: Oh, that's another crit. (laughs)

[01:25:36] Speaker 48: Oh, okay.

[01:25:36] Speaker 1: Well, congratulations, you're dying two.

[01:25:38] Speaker 58: Um-

[01:25:38] Speaker 48: Yes.

[01:25:38] Speaker 58: I'm dying two, baby. Granted, that's only eight points. I had six health points left. He died two, I'm dying two. Um, that's all he can do. Um, this guy has-

[01:25:51] Speaker 1: Yeah, when you're at low levels, you save your last hero point to not die.

[01:25:54] Speaker 58: Nah, there's no risk in that.

[01:25:56] Speaker 1: (laughs) He'll take a... He's gonna take a step over there. Um, and he'll take a crack at you. Let's see if I can keep up the luck with the, uh... No, that's the other side of the dice. That is a crumble.

[01:26:09] Speaker 48: (laughs) Yeah. It's all extremes.

[01:26:12] Speaker 1: Oh, that's big, but-

[01:26:13] Speaker 48: No, that's, uh, pretty good, bro.

[01:26:17] Speaker 1: Oh, these are... That's a... That's his second attack. So he had 25. That's it. For a whopping four points of damage. Not so strong without the crit on their side.

[01:26:30] Speaker 48: (clears throat)

[01:26:31] Speaker 1: That's it for him.

[01:26:31] Speaker 48: All right, uh, next is Alric. Kotal is on deck. Tell says, "You're fucked." Um, (laughs) oh, five, 10-

[01:26:44] Speaker 1: Nads and taint.

[01:26:45] Speaker 48: 15, 20-

[01:26:46] Speaker 1: By the nads and the taint.

[01:26:48] Speaker 48: 30. All right, he's gonna step on up. He will cast a two action heal on you.

[01:26:56] Speaker 58: Yay.

[01:26:57] Speaker 48: We got a healer, folks.

[01:26:59] Speaker 1: (laughs)

[01:27:00] Speaker 48: Uh, what's my fucking heal on this again?

[01:27:03] Speaker 58: One D8 plus eight.

[01:27:04] Speaker 48: He only does those heal, uh, hit points only, right?

[01:27:07] Speaker 1: Yes.

[01:27:08] Speaker 48: Yeah, hit points only. It doesn't heal stamina.

[01:27:10] Speaker 58: 12.

[01:27:11] Speaker 48: Sweet. That's it.

[01:27:15] Speaker 1: All right, you sure?

[01:27:15] Speaker 48: My name is Aura.

[01:27:16] Speaker 1: Did it damage you instead?

[01:27:19] Speaker 48: No.

[01:27:20] Speaker 1: I don't think it does. That will damage someone of the party.

[01:27:22] Speaker 48: (laughs) I'm still wounded one, right?

[01:27:25] Speaker 1: Yeah, wounded one.

[01:27:26] Speaker 48: Okay. Um-

[01:27:28] Speaker 1: My name is Aura.

[01:27:29] Speaker 48: Hmm?

[01:27:30] Speaker 1: My name is Aura. Is it a five-foot aura or a... I thought it was 10.

[01:27:34] Speaker 48: You're a five-foot aura.

[01:27:35] Speaker 1: So I'm out of it then. Yeah.

[01:27:37] Speaker 48: Okay, next is Kotal. I'm on deck.

[01:27:41] Speaker 1: Right. Step me diagonal, so that I can...

[01:27:46] Speaker 48: Right here?

[01:27:46] Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah. Diagonal to him, sorry. Yeah. And I will swing over your body.

[01:27:51] Speaker 48: Oh, rude. (clears throat) You got reach?

[01:27:54] Speaker 1: Yep, yeah. Quarter-staffs have, uh, got 10-foot reach I think.

[01:27:58] Speaker 58: 12.

[01:27:59] Speaker 1: That would miss. I... Seems so, but never wanna sing. These guys are not as bad as the little piggies were.

[01:28:09] Speaker 58: Not.

[01:28:12] Speaker 48: You got this, you got this.

[01:28:15] Speaker 58: I've rolled six, three times in a row.

[01:28:17] Speaker 48: (laughs)

[01:28:18] Speaker 58: Six, six, six.

[01:28:18] Speaker 1: (inhales deeply) Well, better than a one, a one.

[01:28:21] Speaker 58: Fairly good.

[01:28:22] Speaker 48: All right. Uh, I stand up, I grab my maul and I will attack.

[01:28:34] Speaker 1: Yeah, so it wouldn't be looking so hot.

[01:28:36] Speaker 48: Um, so, uh, 24 to hit.

[01:28:38] Speaker 1: That'll hit.

[01:28:42] Speaker 48: Um... Oh, I'd lost my rage, didn't I?

[01:28:45] Speaker 1: Yep.

[01:28:45] Speaker 48: Okay. Um, so 10 points of bludgeoning damage.

[01:28:50] Speaker 1: Okay. He goes flat.

[01:28:53] Speaker 58: Yay.

[01:28:54] Speaker 48: First flat.

[01:28:59] Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, there'll be all three. Right now, up next is Kotal Kahn. Um, just re-targets and...

[01:29:11] Speaker 59: Who's standing after one?

[01:29:12] Speaker 1: Yeah, that's why I'm coming in twice.

[01:29:14] Speaker 48: Oh, root beer-

[01:29:15] Speaker 1: Into-

[01:29:15] Speaker 48: Yeah.

[01:29:16] Speaker 1: Oh, I can smell the root beers.

[01:29:17] Speaker 60: Yeah, they're good. They were addictive. I had one, and now I'm gonna have another.

[01:29:20] Speaker 1: (laughs) Yeah, he will go after you.

[01:29:22] Speaker 48: I could care less if you float.

[01:29:23] Speaker 60: Yes, I recommend it. And there's 20.

[01:29:28] Speaker 1: Um, so he will attack you. Uh, that's gonna be a 28.

[01:29:37] Speaker 60: As a hit, not a crit.

[01:29:38] Speaker 48: Ooh, that's gonna hit.

[01:29:39] Speaker 58: Yay.

[01:29:39] Speaker 1: He hits for 10 points max damage, unless you crit. Um, he'll take a second attack on you. He only has three things he can do, and he's at full attack.

[01:29:50] Speaker 48: Oh, that's a crit.

[01:29:52] Speaker 1: Ah, yeah, that is a crit. (laughs)

[01:29:54] Speaker 48: Are you going down?

[01:29:55] Speaker 58: Crip.

[01:29:55] Speaker 1: There's a reason, there's a reason these are my gaming dice.

[01:29:58] Speaker 60: You all roll two ones.

[01:29:58] Speaker 1: (laughs) Um, that would be-

[01:30:01] Speaker 48: Yep.

[01:30:01] Speaker 1: ... seven double is 14.

[01:30:02] Speaker 60: (laughs)

[01:30:07] Speaker 1: Um.

[01:30:07] Speaker 58: Uh-oh.

[01:30:08] Speaker 1: He'll take a five-foot step, I think since you're the closest one, he'll go right there.

[01:30:12] Speaker 48: Oh, that's convenient. Thank you.

[01:30:15] Speaker 1: As he menacingly comes towards you.

[01:30:17] Speaker 48: Yeah.

[01:30:17] Speaker 1: And that's it for him.

[01:30:18] Speaker 48: Saved me an action. Um, next is Alric. You two are going down more than my loose socks.

[01:30:25] Speaker 1: (laughs) We are going down.

[01:30:27] Speaker 48: (laughs)

[01:30:27] Speaker 1: Is that the, um... No, you're the bottom of the order, right?

[01:30:31] Speaker 48: (laughs)

[01:30:31] Speaker 1: (laughs) Yeah, I don't think so.

[01:30:33] Speaker 48: All right, I will-

[01:30:35] Speaker 60: The order is all different now. (laughs)

[01:30:36] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[01:30:37] Speaker 60: What are the three party numbers now?

[01:30:39] Speaker 58: You can get 14 points.

[01:30:41] Speaker 48: All right. I will-

[01:30:44] Speaker 1: I will see your 14, and I will accept 13.

[01:30:46] Speaker 48: It is the same order now, it's just I'm the top because of the way things shifted.

[01:30:49] Speaker 1: (laughs) Uh, I'm done at the... Yeah, it doesn't really matter, it's gonna be an around thing.

[01:30:54] Speaker 48: Uh, I gotta get a root beer float. (laughs)

[01:30:58] Speaker 1: Seeing as you guys, um... Particularly Odessa pops in there and says, "Oh, no, look you're hurt. Just like a poor little rabbit." And she pulls out a strawberry.

[01:31:08] Speaker 48: Wait, which one's Odessa?

[01:31:10] Speaker 1: You're Odessa, she was-

[01:31:11] Speaker 48: No, no, no.

[01:31:12] Speaker 1: They're just top of order. Isn't really an issue.

[01:31:15] Speaker 48: Okay. Um, next is me. I will... What the hell? I'll try intimidating glare.

[01:31:22] Speaker 43: Hey, who are y- we already killed your friend. You don't want no more of this.

[01:31:26] Speaker 1: (laughs)

[01:31:28] Speaker 61: Um, so with a minus four... Oh, well you told me if it's a minus four. It's either a 12 or an eight, so it's not great.

[01:31:34] Speaker 43: Oh, minus four for... Oh, that's right, you don't have that. Yeah. Yeah.

[01:31:37] Speaker 1: Um, that's will?

[01:31:41] Speaker 43: Mm-hmm.

[01:31:42] Speaker 1: Yeah, that would fail. Just to be sure.

[01:31:43] Speaker 43: All right. Uh, I'll make two attacks on the fucker. Um, so that's a 17 to hit.

[01:31:54] Speaker 1: You just miss.

[01:31:55] Speaker 43: And an 18 to hit.

[01:31:57] Speaker 1: 18 will hit.

[01:31:58] Speaker 43: Sweet. Um, so 12 points of bludgeoning damage.

[01:32:04] Speaker 1: Let's move and hold some back on 'em.

[01:32:06] Speaker 43: All right. That's my turn.

[01:32:08] Speaker 1: I think Irvin did mean right before then.

[01:32:10] Speaker 43: Yeah, that was Kotal's turn.

[01:32:13] Speaker 2: The things, grabbing stands.

[01:32:16] Speaker 43: (laughs) Man. All right, uh-

[01:32:21] Speaker 1: Admittedly, it's one nice thing about 3D dice-

[01:32:24] Speaker 43: Too tiring. Guys.

[01:32:24] Speaker 1: ... is you can grab a stand and still get two attacks off.

[01:32:26] Speaker 2: Yep.

[01:32:26] Speaker 1: Which is really good.

[01:32:27] Speaker 2: And I rolled a two and three. For the record. (laughs)

[01:32:29] Speaker 1: (laughs)

[01:32:29] Speaker 43: Oh, my God.

[01:32:30] Speaker 2: It was a good flurry.

[01:32:32] Speaker 43: We got cred cred-ing over here, uh-

[01:32:34] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[01:32:34] Speaker 43: ... flurries of misses.

[01:32:36] Speaker 62: It was, yeah, it was flurry of misses, not flurry of blows.

[01:32:40] Speaker 1: Um, I think- And it's green two again.

[01:32:42] Speaker 43: Oh, green two already?

[01:32:43] Speaker 62: Yeah.

[01:32:44] Speaker 1: Um, he has two attacks. Um, so even/odd. Even's going after Kotal.

[01:32:52] Speaker 43: Kotal.

[01:32:52] Speaker 1: Kotal. I'm gonna get it wrong because of Mortal Kombat. There's a character named Kotal Kahn.

[01:32:57] Speaker 43: I'm guessing that.

[01:32:59] Speaker 1: Um, that would be seven to two.

[01:33:01] Speaker 43: Man, I haven't played that game in ever.

[01:33:01] Speaker 62: It is hard to play, it's like MK3.

[01:33:04] Speaker 1: Um, he'll then attack you with a second attack.

[01:33:07] Speaker 43: I think it was one or two, last time I played it, yeah.

[01:33:09] Speaker 1: For you, he would hit a... I think that's-

[01:33:11] Speaker 43: AC18.

[01:33:13] Speaker 1: I think he rolls a 19, but we just don't-

[01:33:15] Speaker 43: Back when it was still like, the giant, like arcade machines?

[01:33:19] Speaker 1: Yeah, I think over 20.

[01:33:19] Speaker 43: Yep, you hit me.

[01:33:19] Speaker 1: For a whopping eight points.

[01:33:21] Speaker 43: Holy shit! Okay, I'm still up.

[01:33:24] Speaker 62: What the hell is...

[01:33:25] Speaker 1: He has technically one more actually.

[01:33:28] Speaker 2: Oh, yeah. It is. F2E stamina.

[01:33:30] Speaker 1: Even, so he's going after Kotal one last time, with a six. It wasn't a 20.

[01:33:37] Speaker 43: That's going to miss.

[01:33:38] Speaker 1: That's it for him.

[01:33:40] Speaker 43: Okay, next is Ulric. All right. Well, I'm going to blast away. I'm going to start blasting.

[01:33:50] Speaker 1: How are you blasting?

[01:33:51] Speaker 43: Oh, with uh, some needle darts.

[01:33:56] Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

[01:33:57] Speaker 43: That'd be a 21.

[01:33:59] Speaker 1: That'll hit.

[01:33:59] Speaker 43: So, it would be for 11 points.

[01:34:02] Speaker 1: Hmm, that's a good hit.

[01:34:04] Speaker 62: Why is... There's more stamina rules.

[01:34:07] Speaker 1: Hmm. Would they increase it or does it just then show before?

[01:34:13] Speaker 43: I'm done.

[01:34:14] Speaker 1: Okay. Um, bottom of the round?

[01:34:17] Speaker 43: Yep.

[01:34:18] Speaker 1: Um, flutters, flutters up, hides behind your collar. With, um, Vid- uh, Vidia, who's also hiding behind your collar.

[01:34:33] Speaker 43: Still can't add my recipe.

[01:34:36] Speaker 1: Unless you guys want to designate who Vidia's going to be following, at some point.

[01:34:38] Speaker 2: I don't want to.

[01:34:40] Speaker 1: Um, there-

[01:34:41] Speaker 2: Not that I work for me, and she's been on my collar for the last 200 years or whatever. I don't know. (laughs)

[01:34:46] Speaker 62: I mean, you guys could like-

[01:34:48] Speaker 1: Yeah, you never, you never know.

[01:34:49] Speaker 43: Or, um...

[01:34:49] Speaker 1: You don't know, because you haven't... At some point, you could ask these guys how long it's been.

[01:34:53] Speaker 43: Yeah. On 25 minutes-

[01:34:55] Speaker 1: Uh, I really don't know.

[01:34:56] Speaker 43: Both hit.

[01:34:57] Speaker 1: Like, as a player, I don't know.

[01:34:58] Speaker 43: Will it survive?

[01:35:03] Speaker 1: Uh, 15 points of bludgeoning damage.

[01:35:04] Speaker 43: Yeah, and what happens to him?

[01:35:06] Speaker 1: I just go splat. "I've had enough of you," and try and splat him into the ground as hard as I can. Um-

[01:35:16] Speaker 2: There's an, there's an action. Oh, well, there's a stabilize rule. If you have resolve points left and you're dying at the beginning of your turn-

[01:35:22] Speaker 1: Oh yeah.

[01:35:23] Speaker 2: ... you can spend a resolve point and be zero, and be stable at zero.

[01:35:26] Speaker 43: Oh.

[01:35:27] Speaker 1: You have to spend all of them, or is it just... I can't remember if you-

[01:35:30] Speaker 2: You spend one.

[01:35:30] Speaker 1: Then we're stable.

[01:35:31] Speaker 62: Oh.

[01:35:31] Speaker 2: To stabilize at zero hit points.

[01:35:32] Speaker 43: Sweet.

[01:35:33] Speaker 62: Wow, spend at zero points?

[01:35:34] Speaker 1: It's actually a star finder too.

[01:35:36] Speaker 2: At the start of the character's next turn, they gain one hit point and wake up.

[01:35:41] Speaker 43: Holy shit.

[01:35:41] Speaker 2: Then you might-

[01:35:42] Speaker 43: That's a lot stronger. Yeah.

[01:35:44] Speaker 1: You, um, I mean you burn through them, but those kind of mean that some party has to rest more often.

[01:35:48] Speaker 43: Yeah.

[01:35:48] Speaker 1: But it is kind of a nice...

[01:35:50] Speaker 2: It's something that's, uh, variant rule is designed for parties that have less access to healing.

[01:35:55] Speaker 43: Yeah.

[01:35:55] Speaker 1: Yes.

[01:35:55] Speaker 43: Honestly, I, one thing that kind of annoyed me was the endless constant being able to heal up all the time. So I'd kind of like that a little bit more.

[01:36:06] Speaker 1: Yeah, if you don't have a caster in your party, there's almost no reason to even take a rest. So-

[01:36:12] Speaker 43: Exactly. Well, I definitely want to rest, take a breather-

[01:36:15] Speaker 1: (laughs)

[01:36:15] Speaker 43: ... rest for 10 minutes and recover all the stamina.

[01:36:18] Speaker 2: And, um...

[01:36:19] Speaker 1: Yep, you guys can spend a resolve, get your stamina back.

[01:36:21] Speaker 2: Rul- rules as written are that wounded condition ends if you are restored to full hit points and rest for 10 minutes. You don't have to get your stamina back.

[01:36:35] Speaker 43: Oh.

[01:36:35] Speaker 2: But you'd have to rest for 10 minutes, so I'm still wounded.

[01:36:39] Speaker 43: So you rest 10 minutes, you get your stamina points back?

[01:36:41] Speaker 2: Yeah, or you have to spend a resolve.

[01:36:42] Speaker 43: Yeah.

[01:36:44] Speaker 2: So you can only do that a, that X, X number of times per day.

[01:36:47] Speaker 1: Correct.

[01:36:47] Speaker 2: Okay. Who stays at my turn? How was it last time?

[01:36:49] Speaker 1: I think we're done.

[01:36:50] Speaker 43: Oh, we're done.

[01:36:51] Speaker 2: Oh.

[01:36:51] Speaker 1: He splattered it.

[01:36:51] Speaker 2: Oh, I didn't know he did.

[01:36:53] Speaker 43: Yep.

[01:36:53] Speaker 1: Yeah, you guys can spend a good t- um, 10, 20 minutes, however long you want to rest up.

[01:36:56] Speaker 43: Yeah.

[01:36:57] Speaker 1: Um, Iradesza will, will fly around and give you guys, you know, fruits and whatnot. Um, she offers you guys two really nice foods. Um, which will count as a, um, healing potion.

[01:37:16] Speaker 43: Okay.

[01:37:17] Speaker 1: Um, so-

[01:37:18] Speaker 2: So they just like-

[01:37:20] Speaker 62: Expire?

[01:37:21] Speaker 2: Yeah. Are they like-

[01:37:22] Speaker 1: No, they're, uh, they're, they're, they're count as a healing potion, but you can put ap- or strawberry healing potion if you want to.

[01:37:27] Speaker 2: For the... Indefinite or do they-

[01:37:28] Speaker 1: Yeah, they're indefinitely.

[01:37:28] Speaker 2: ... expire?

[01:37:30] Speaker 1: These are just like regular healing potions, but it's in, it's a enchanted strawberry.

[01:37:35] Speaker 63: Nice.

[01:37:37] Speaker 64: I would like to spend a second 10 minutes treating wounds and trying to heal him up a little bit.

[01:37:42] Speaker 65: I could try to heal your wounds.

[01:37:44] Speaker 64: Do you have any medicine? All right, uh, don't want that. I have okay... I'm a little okay at healing myself if you think you'd be better at it.

[01:37:52] Speaker 65: Of course.

[01:37:53] Speaker 64: All right, I trust you.

[01:37:55] Speaker 65: Let me pull out my healing kit.

[01:37:56] Speaker 64: Pulling big scissors.

[01:37:58] Speaker 65: Come here.

[01:37:59] Speaker 64: (laughs) With a big needle.

[01:38:02] Speaker 65: I can stitch you up just fine.

[01:38:05] Speaker 64: We're gonna say this happened while I was recovering stamina and so I didn't really have a choice in the matter. (laughs)

[01:38:11] Speaker 65: (laughs)

[01:38:12] Speaker 64: Okay, just, ow.

[01:38:16] Speaker 65: Shut 'em. I'll stitch you up. May be painful. Um-

[01:38:20] Speaker 1: Someone's gonna wind up with risky surgery eventually. (laughs)

[01:38:23] Speaker 65: Oh, I totally am. (laughs)

[01:38:25] Speaker 64: That's a fun one.

[01:38:27] Speaker 65: You might not have a choice, but all my medicine is going to be risky surgery. (laughs)

[01:38:33] Speaker 64: Don't you have a +0 to healing?

[01:38:36] Speaker 65: Oh, no, that's 18. I'm actually decent.

[01:38:39] Speaker 64: Uh, do you roll the dice or do I do that?

[01:38:42] Speaker 65: Uh, I don't care. Do you wanna roll or I can roll?

[01:38:44] Speaker 64: I'll let you do it.

[01:38:46] Speaker 65: Uh, how about nine points.

[01:38:48] Speaker 64: Sweet.

[01:38:49] Speaker 65: There.

[01:38:49] Speaker 64: I'm still not fully healed.

[01:38:51] Speaker 63: I, uh, you healed me to full with your spell in combat.

[01:38:53] Speaker 65: Okay. Oh, let me try it on myself. Oh, that's failed.

[01:39:04] Speaker 1: Now you're immune for now 'cause we're level one again.

[01:39:07] Speaker 65: Yeah.

[01:39:07] Speaker 1: Oh, well done.

[01:39:10] Speaker 64: So-

[01:39:12] Speaker 65: Now I rub some dirt on it just to make sure it's, it's all treated well.

[01:39:15] Speaker 66: Put what on it?

[01:39:16] Speaker 65: Some dirt.

[01:39:17] Speaker 66: Okay.

[01:39:18] Speaker 64: I, I don't need dirt on me. I'm not sure I need dirt on me.

[01:39:21] Speaker 65: Trust me! I know what I'm talking about.

[01:39:23] Speaker 64: Kids think dirt is gonna hurt them. (laughs)

[01:39:26] Speaker 1: I'm 250 years old. I'm hardly a kid.

[01:39:30] Speaker 64: Young'un.

[01:39:30] Speaker 1: Mm. If you guys compare the age of the years, who knows?

[01:39:36] Speaker 64: (laughs)

[01:39:37] Speaker 65: Um, everybody's a kid.

[01:39:40] Speaker 1: At any rate the, um, two fey while you guys are healing up, you know they look at the boar. Um, if you guys look at it, I mean, you can take it with you for dinner too, if you wanted.

[01:39:49] Speaker 63: I didn't read this fey while it was healing up-

[01:39:51] Speaker 66: (sneezes)

[01:39:51] Speaker 1: Absolutely.

[01:39:51] Speaker 63: ... so I would probably take a look with them, inspect them carefully.

[01:39:54] Speaker 1: Um, yeah, the boar is full of, um, little needles. Not only needle darts, but, um, needles as it probably shot from these guys.

[01:40:03] Speaker 63: Okay.

[01:40:04] Speaker 1: Um, she looks over at the, uh, dead, uh, plant creatures and says, "Oh yes, those are guardians of the grove. They must be of, have gone nuts."

[01:40:14] Speaker 63: Because of the dryad?

[01:40:16] Speaker 1: Yes.

[01:40:16] Speaker 63: Because of that?

[01:40:16] Speaker 1: She thinks under stress they probably went into, uh, big defensive mode and started attacking everything.

[01:40:21] Speaker 64: Guardian. Sorry, that was a healing potion minor that we got?

[01:40:25] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[01:40:25] Speaker 63: Yeah. Yeah. Basically.

[01:40:26] Speaker 65: Better be careful. She's been after my recipe too.

[01:40:30] Speaker 63: Your recipe sounds valuable.

[01:40:33] Speaker 65: It is.

[01:40:34] Speaker 63: Many want it.

[01:40:36] Speaker 65: The fey have been after me for centuries for my recipe. The cold cuts are to die for.

[01:40:44] Speaker 64: Then why are you helping these fey creatures, friend?

[01:40:48] Speaker 65: Hmm, that's a good point. I don't know.

[01:40:53] Speaker 64: Okay.

[01:40:54] Speaker 65: What else I gotta do?

[01:40:56] Speaker 64: I'm Broden, by the way.

[01:40:59] Speaker 65: No. I'm Alric.

[01:41:01] Speaker 64: Nice to meet you.

[01:41:02] Speaker 63: I am called Katala.

[01:41:05] Speaker 65: Yeah, you too.

[01:41:07] Speaker 64: That was some very helpful healing you provided there. We desperately needed it.

[01:41:12] Speaker 65: Uh, not me. It's Talos.

[01:41:14] Speaker 63: I am in your debt.

[01:41:18] Speaker 1: You guys would probably-

[01:41:19] Speaker 64: That'll be 5 gold then.

[01:41:19] Speaker 1: Do you guys have religion?

[01:41:20] Speaker 65: (laughs) Just kidding.

[01:41:22] Speaker 63: I shall-

[01:41:22] Speaker 64: I don't.

[01:41:23] Speaker 65: I, uh-

[01:41:24] Speaker 63: I shall be happy to provide aid.

[01:41:25] Speaker 65: It is the least I could do for you bring me back from the, uh, stony afterlife.

[01:41:30] Speaker 1: You guys may not remember much, but Talos is one of the human demigods.

[01:41:35] Speaker 64: Yes, he ascended to the Nine Gods.

[01:41:38] Speaker 65: (laughs)

[01:41:39] Speaker 63: I do not have the religion.

[01:41:41] Speaker 1: Oh. Um, so, um, after you guys heal up, the fey, um, get a little impatient but they start ushering you on. Um, they say, "Hurry up, we must find another to help us."

[01:41:52] Speaker 63: We must.

[01:41:53] Speaker 1: Um-

[01:41:53] Speaker 63: Help the grove.

[01:41:54] Speaker 1: ... you go a little ways further and you start coming into, um... (coughs) It's not... you're kind of curving back around. You're approaching maybe the, you know, the bank of the river and you come across a, um, um, kind of a nice little clearing area. And you look up in a tree and there's a nice little house, uh, elven house built up in the tree.

[01:42:17] Speaker 65: Like full sized?

[01:42:19] Speaker 1: Um, it's n- fair, kind of small. Looks elvish by the looks of it.

[01:42:23] Speaker 63: Is it s- small creature sized house or-

[01:42:28] Speaker 1: No, this is big.

[01:42:28] Speaker 63: ... normal tall person house that is just a small for... it's not a mansion?

[01:42:32] Speaker 1: Oh.

[01:42:32] Speaker 63: What do you imagine?

[01:42:33] Speaker 1: This is, like-

[01:42:33] Speaker 66: Like... (clears throat)

[01:42:34] Speaker 63: Is this fairy sized house-

[01:42:35] Speaker 1: Oh, no.

[01:42:35] Speaker 63: ... or is this real elf sized house?

[01:42:37] Speaker 1: This is real elf sized house.

[01:42:38] Speaker 63: Okay. Okay.

[01:42:38] Speaker 1: Bear in mind when I say jung- or, uh, forest, this is like, um, Spokane, Redwood, you know, super tall.

[01:42:46] Speaker 63: Mm-hmm. Very big, tall trees.

[01:42:47] Speaker 1: Yeah. All the area, most of this area is kind of like that. Um-

[01:42:51] Speaker 65: Very thick.

[01:42:52] Speaker 1: They get there and they start yelping for, in Elvish, um... well, actually in Sprigan, their, their language. Um, and eventually a, um, elf jumps out of the tree and lands in front of you guys and says, "Okay, okay. What's, what's the matter? What's going on?" Um, and they start saying, "Oh, look, we brought some friends but we really need your help," and, "Can you please help us? Please. Please." Um, you know, "We promise not to take your strawberries again." Um, I mean, they're probably lying, but, um, but the character that pops out of the tree looks like that.

[01:43:29] Speaker 63: Hmm.

[01:43:31] Speaker 1: Um, you would recognize this as a wood elf. Um, this is not the area that they're from. They're... If you remember the world map, they're from far... Not far from the Iron Kingdoms. Um, uh, and she has a miniature too, around here somewhere. Um, where I put it somewhere. All right. Looks like this. She's a wood elf. She has like this cloak and there's a lot of little, um-

[01:43:53] Speaker 64: It is like... Yeah.

[01:43:55] Speaker 1: Uh, they look like the supply trap things in her cloak.

[01:44:00] Speaker 64: Mm.

[01:44:00] Speaker 1: So I'll put that there. That's not going to stand. Um, she looks at you guys, um, kind of mutters to herself a little bit. Looks over at you for a second, is taken back a little bit. And then-

[01:44:16] Speaker 64: Oh, yeah. Go on.

[01:44:17] Speaker 1: Says, "Oh, sorry. I didn't mean that. You just reminded me of someone, that's all." Um...

[01:44:23] Speaker 64: Was he short?

[01:44:24] Speaker 1: No. Welcome to the... No, just an acquaintance. Um-

[01:44:28] Speaker 64: He was great.

[01:44:29] Speaker 1: Oh.

[01:44:29] Speaker 64: So he wasn't short.

[01:44:31] Speaker 1: Welcome to-

[01:44:32] Speaker 64: And he wasn't gray. (laughs)

[01:44:33] Speaker 1: It's my home.

[01:44:34] Speaker 67: That's how I reminded her of him though.

[01:44:36] Speaker 1: My name is Aelysh and it's spelled A-E-L-Y-S-H. Um, and you've met another one of the, um, from Aes Piosayn.

[01:44:46] Speaker 68: Yay.

[01:44:46] Speaker 1: Um, welcome to my home. I hear you guys are helping them out, I see. What is this, um, that they are asking of? Uh, spiders in a-

[01:45:01] Speaker 64: Spiders in a tree? Honestly, I barely understood. They talk so fast.

[01:45:06] Speaker 69: I don't know. They just found me. Kinda just wandering through the woods with a bunch of strangers.

[01:45:12] Speaker 1: Well, I suppose. Uh, if we must, um... She glares, looks over at them and says, "Have they been tested?" Um, (clears throat) little, uh, um, Iridessa just... She kind of looks at you and then gives double thumbs up. Um, (coughs)

[01:45:33] Speaker 69: I took my wagon driving test years ago, lady.

[01:45:35] Speaker 1: (laughs) Well, I suppose we must be, uh, headed off. Um, and if you guys have any questions for her, um, there's not much time. So, she... This woman more than willing to, um, assist. Who might you be?

[01:45:55] Speaker 67: Uh, I am Roldan Grimstone.

[01:45:58] Speaker 1: Oh, slayer nonetheless. Um-

[01:46:01] Speaker 67: Does that bother you?

[01:46:03] Speaker 1: No, I have no issue with slayers, just something else. She trails off in thought for a second. Um, looks at your... Looks at you. Um, you would be?

[01:46:16] Speaker 69: What? I got something on me?

[01:46:17] Speaker 1: You look familiar for some reason.

[01:46:19] Speaker 64: (laughs)

[01:46:20] Speaker 1: You might have seen him in a garden.

[01:46:22] Speaker 69: (laughs)

[01:46:23] Speaker 1: Yeah, so-

[01:46:24] Speaker 69: Uh, you probably know me as Alrek the Chef Extraordinaire. People have been after my sandwich recipes for years.

[01:46:33] Speaker 1: Hmm.

[01:46:34] Speaker 69: Don't even get me started on my custard pies.

[01:46:36] Speaker 1: He was a statue like five minutes ago.

[01:46:39] Speaker 69: (laughs)

[01:46:42] Speaker 1: Yeah, see, um-

[01:46:43] Speaker 69: Let's just say I hear about strawberries.

[01:46:45] Speaker 1: (laughs) She probably sees a little fey hiding in your shoulder and is... Just kind of glares at you, um, you know, outsiders kind of, kind of look. She then looks over at you. And you have not met your kind here before.

[01:47:01] Speaker 70: I am called Kotal. I am traveling far from my homeland.

[01:47:07] Speaker 1: Actually, um, I like your kind. I would actually be interested in learning more of you perhaps. Um, this is my home, as it were. So you are new inhabitants of Tigrum's Crossing or they sent you here, I'm guessing?

[01:47:24] Speaker 64: Where is this on the map?

[01:47:24] Speaker 1: Not too far away. This is actually-

[01:47:27] Speaker 64: Is this still on the same hex?

[01:47:28] Speaker 1: Yeah, this, uh, this would be in the same hex.

[01:47:30] Speaker 64: Okay.

[01:47:30] Speaker 1: You wandered off, you kind of went through some trees and the fey, they don't understand time and they don't understand a straight line. So you've kind of figured that this is probably (laughs)... You know, you feel like you've been walking for hours, you turn around, the bridge is right there because they've been winding around every tree-

[01:47:43] Speaker 64: (laughs)

[01:47:44] Speaker 1: ... that you've come across. So you're actually surprisingly not too terribly far away.

[01:47:50] Speaker 64: That's fine. I mean, my character has no idea. I was just curious for my own knowledge.

[01:47:54] Speaker 1: So what would... I'm taking you're not with the guards from the crossing?

[01:48:01] Speaker 64: No, Kotal and I were just protecting a caravan and we ended up here. Now these fairies asked for help and here we are. Along the way, we came across a statue and thus Alrek joined our be- merry band.

[01:48:17] Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

[01:48:18] Speaker 69: I'm famous.

[01:48:20] Speaker 1: She looks like she doesn't, uh-

[01:48:21] Speaker 69: Alrek knows.

[01:48:22] Speaker 1: ... want to know the whole story, but maybe someday. Um, says, "Well, maybe my story isn't too different. I fell off a caravan and here I am." Um, the fey at this point are getting kind of, um, you know, um, impatient and start gesturing her on. Um...

[01:48:40] Speaker 64: You fell off a caravan?

[01:48:43] Speaker 1: Um, yes. I fell asleep, fell off and, you know, fell down a small embankment and decided not to hop back on.

[01:48:58] Speaker 64: Hmm.

[01:48:59] Speaker 1: And then eventually came across-

[01:49:01] Speaker 64: She cuts your head.

[01:49:01] Speaker 1: ... Tigrum's Crossing and here. It is such a dangerous place. Sad to say I can't get too far away from the crossing, as much as I'd like to find somewhere else.

[01:49:10] Speaker 64: (laughs)

[01:49:12] Speaker 1: Too dangerous for ￡ all you get. Um, so the, the fey will take you guys. You guys wander out for a bit further. Um, maybe with her, um, guidance, uh, they're a little bit more on track, but not much. You don't go very too far though until, um... (clears throat) You hear a familiar voice, um-Fawn comes flying back, um, after all this time. (paper rustling) He says, "I have good news. Willie's not gonna join us."

[01:49:46] Speaker 71: That's good news.

[01:49:47] Speaker 1: "Oh, yeah. He tested poorly again. But here, look at this." And he, uh, pulls you out a special, um, kind of gourd-like, it's like an apple-like gourd thing that, um... He says, "I've, um, I added some of my special, um, magical nature sauce into it." And you, ah... And he gives that to you guys. Um, if you guys, you guys have nature?

[01:50:14] Speaker 72: I do.

[01:50:15] Speaker 73: No.

[01:50:15] Speaker 1: You can do a test to see if you can figure out what this counts as 'cause I, in my wisdom, did not write down what it is.

[01:50:23] Speaker 71: We got some good old magical sauce? (laughs)

[01:50:27] Speaker 1: It would count as an oil of pot- What did you roll? Oh, okay.

[01:50:31] Speaker 72: Oh.

[01:50:31] Speaker 71: (laughs)

[01:50:33] Speaker 1: I already said oil of something.

[01:50:35] Speaker 73: Oil. I don't know what it is.

[01:50:36] Speaker 1: Just remember you now have a-

[01:50:39] Speaker 73: I, I will just ask him, what does this do?

[01:50:42] Speaker 1: Um, he'll describe it a little bit. It's an oil of potency.

[01:50:46] Speaker 72: Oh.

[01:50:46] Speaker 1: You sh- put it on your weapon, I think it counts as a plus one weapon for combat if I'm mistaken.

[01:50:53] Speaker 71: Do I have nature? No, I don't have it.

[01:50:55] Speaker 1: You sure? We could roll for it.

[01:50:57] Speaker 71: All right. Thank you, friend. Do you have a weapon? Should we roll? Do you?

[01:51:03] Speaker 74: (sneezes) Well, I got a big ass sword.

[01:51:06] Speaker 71: All right.

[01:51:07] Speaker 74: But then...

[01:51:08] Speaker 1: Did you use that?

[01:51:08] Speaker 74: Poorly. Apparently.

[01:51:10] Speaker 71: If you don't mind, (laughs) I think I'll apply it to them all.

[01:51:13] Speaker 74: Apparently from the last battle, I didn't use it very well.

[01:51:16] Speaker 72: It's single use. You should decide when to use it.

[01:51:18] Speaker 71: Oh, okay.

[01:51:19] Speaker 72: It's consumable.

[01:51:20] Speaker 71: Yeah.

[01:51:20] Speaker 72: I think it's one... 10 minutes or something, an hour. I don't remember. Look it up.

[01:51:24] Speaker 71: Uh, yeah, I'm looking it up.

[01:51:25] Speaker 72: But it's, it's not a permanent thing.

[01:51:28] Speaker 1: And then bounding out of the, uh, forest behind him, he says, "Yeah, and I found, but I couldn't find him, but I could find Old Grim." That's not Old Grim.

[01:51:35] Speaker 71: It becomes a plus one striking weapon?

[01:51:37] Speaker 1: It's pretty good, but it's a consumable, so it's...

[01:51:40] Speaker 71: Or I could just cast runic weapon.

[01:51:43] Speaker 72: You got a gigantic m- m- m-maul.

[01:51:46] Speaker 73: No.

[01:51:47] Speaker 72: It's good for you, my friend.

[01:51:50] Speaker 71: I do have runic weapon prepared, if you need. I mean, I would never say no to a, a striking thing.

[01:52:00] Speaker 1: Okay. He... That is not him.

[01:52:04] Speaker 71: Sell it?

[01:52:07] Speaker 1: No, buddy.

[01:52:07] Speaker 71: Well, I can just cast it.

[01:52:08] Speaker 1: Yeah, buddy.

[01:52:10] Speaker 71: Okay, it just takes an action to put it on.

[01:52:13] Speaker 1: What's it worth? Um... There he is.

[01:52:16] Speaker 71: Good question. Seven gold?

[01:52:19] Speaker 72: It's not an actual oil of potency. It might be hard to convince a shopkeeper that this weird shit that we got in the woods is worth seven gold.

[01:52:28] Speaker 1: You're gonna see any smearing Fjords, you saw all of them.

[01:52:29] Speaker 71: It goes good on sandwiches.

[01:52:30] Speaker 1: (clears throat)

[01:52:31] Speaker 72: Maybe it does. My friend here wants to test.

[01:52:35] Speaker 1: Uh, bounding out of the forest behind him, he sees old Grim and a kind of older looking Norn.

[01:52:41] Speaker 72: Wait a minute. I've seen him before.

[01:52:45] Speaker 1: Quite possibly, but, uh... He has a miniature too.

[01:52:51] Speaker 72: He has a TV show.

[01:52:53] Speaker 1: I don't think that was actually Fawn, but I think someone probably sharing the image before it.

[01:52:56] Speaker 71: Bjorn Ironside? I don't think that's actually him.

[01:52:58] Speaker 72: No, it just reminds me.

[01:53:00] Speaker 71: Yeah, it does.

[01:53:01] Speaker 72: I don't know where he comes from there. The braided white hair and the tattoos.

[01:53:06] Speaker 71: Yeah, those damn Vikings. You know, they all look the same.

[01:53:09] Speaker 1: He kinda looks like that. Except he's holding a bow apparently. Comes, uh, coming up behind it. Um, and, uh, ah, "Greetings, my friends," he says. Well, I mean, we say hi, my friends. He says, "Greetings. Uh, this little thing came and grabbed me. Says there's trouble. I'm guessing they grabbed you too."

[01:53:35] Speaker 71: "Yes, they tested us and now we're here to deal with whatever is bothering them."

[01:53:43] Speaker 1: Uh-

[01:53:43] Speaker 71: Certified fresh.

[01:53:44] Speaker 1: ... "You were tested too, huh?" He glares at the Fawn, who had bought him. Fawn looks kind of sheepishly.

[01:53:51] Speaker 72: (laughs)

[01:53:51] Speaker 1: And says, "Well, technically he passed." And he looks kind of sheepish, like he, you know... Um, the other two fairies look at him, "Are you sure?" Fawn says, "Yes." Um, "Well, that's good. You'll be quite useful to help us. We've had... We're in dire need of some help." He looks at you guys and says, "I don't recognize you. You don't look familiar." I'm, uh, Grimnar.

[01:54:24] Speaker 71: Grimnar.

[01:54:24] Speaker 72: I am called Kotal.

[01:54:29] Speaker 1: Yeah. Quite... Well, I've heard tales of your kind.

[01:54:37] Speaker 73: Roland Grimstone, at your service.

[01:54:40] Speaker 1: Definitely heard tales of your kind. (clears throat)

[01:54:45] Speaker 71: They got tails?

[01:54:46] Speaker 72: I do.

[01:54:48] Speaker 71: Yeah, you do.

[01:54:49] Speaker 73: (clears throat)

[01:54:51] Speaker 71: I'm a dwarven slayer, friends. I am known far and wide, or my group is anyway.

[01:54:56] Speaker 1: He looks at you and-

[01:54:59] Speaker 72: My little house.

[01:54:59] Speaker 1: ... into a little-
---

[01:55:00] Speaker 1: ... to be out here?

[01:55:00] Speaker 2: Why do you have tails?

[01:55:01] Speaker 3: Aren't you too young to be out here? Damn kids. Always cranking ... (mumbling)

[01:55:07] Speaker 1: (laughs)

[01:55:09] Speaker 4: Well, then let's get going. I think we all right.

[01:55:11] Speaker 3: Think you got some mama's milk to go drink and...

[01:55:15] Speaker 4: Uh, no. I only have the finest mead here of... on this side of the river.

[01:55:20] Speaker 3: Oh, well in that case, I'm Ulric. (laughs) We should be friends.

[01:55:25] Speaker 4: Ulric?

[01:55:26] Speaker 3: Yes.

[01:55:27] Speaker 4: Some norn blood in you? Ulric could be a name for both, uh, in Fallengrow. But there are Ulrics in Northside.

[01:55:34] Speaker 3: I don't know. You gotta talk to my mama about that.

[01:55:36] Speaker 2: (laughs)

[01:55:37] Speaker 1: My head count is Ulric is 30 years old. He's just, he just aged terribly.

[01:55:42] Speaker 3: (laughs) No, he's an old fucker.

[01:55:44] Speaker 1: No, he's 30.

[01:55:45] Speaker 3: (laughs) He's 32.

[01:55:47] Speaker 1: (laughs) So, um-

[01:55:52] Speaker 3: I think I age him like 75 or something like that.

[01:55:55] Speaker 1: But you guys have now met another one of the, uh, dramatic persona. What was his name again?

[01:56:02] Speaker 2: Uh, Grul... Grimnar.

[01:56:04] Speaker 1: Grimnar.

[01:56:04] Speaker 2: Grimnar.

[01:56:05] Speaker 5: Yeah.

[01:56:06] Speaker 1: Okay. I'd have to look it up to see how I spelled that.

[01:56:08] Speaker 3: Sorry but I think I did actually age him to look like 75. Very close to my god's name.

[01:56:15] Speaker 1: Now if anyone wants to play either of those two characters you can help me out a little bit.

[01:56:19] Speaker 5: (coughs)

[01:56:21] Speaker 1: Not necessarily role play, just in combat.

[01:56:22] Speaker 2: Yeah, sure.

[01:56:24] Speaker 1: Um, any preference?

[01:56:25] Speaker 2: Boh.

[01:56:26] Speaker 1: Boh? Uh, okay.

[01:56:28] Speaker 2: I'm already doing...

[01:56:31] Speaker 5: Uh, I'll take Grimnar.

[01:56:32] Speaker 2: Aelish or-

[01:56:33] Speaker 1: Oh, he wanted the Boh one.

[01:56:35] Speaker 2: Oh, that's the one. Oh yeah, I'll take Aelish then.

[01:56:38] Speaker 1: You know, I've just found these guys is really, really simple. They're not really... They're s- basically off of a class. So basically just have their stats, a few roles, and they have kind of their logic what they would do.

[01:56:47] Speaker 2: Yeah.

[01:56:49] Speaker 1: Just to make it easy to play.

[01:56:50] Speaker 2: Brilliant.

[01:56:50] Speaker 1: I didn't want these to be spending half an hour trying to read the Pathfinder II class sheets.

[01:56:57] Speaker 2: Nine.

[01:56:59] Speaker 1: (coughs) So you guys are taking on a little ways further. Um, and eventually you-

[01:57:04] Speaker 3: What exactly we're doing here?

[01:57:08] Speaker 2: Save the Dryad.

[01:57:09] Speaker 4: Yep.

[01:57:10] Speaker 3: Of what?

[01:57:11] Speaker 2: Spiders.

[01:57:11] Speaker 4: Spiders.

[01:57:14] Speaker 5: Kotars, if you haven't noticed, um, man of few words.

[01:57:21] Speaker 3: Why is that?

[01:57:21] Speaker 5: Why he's a third and fourth word one? Two is enough.

[01:57:24] Speaker 3: Why is that?

[01:57:26] Speaker 5: You don't have to ask him.

[01:57:26] Speaker 3: (laughs) I am asking.

[01:57:28] Speaker 5: Well, he didn't say he was a man of few words.

[01:57:30] Speaker 3: Oh, no.

[01:57:30] Speaker 5: I was just telling you out of character.

[01:57:33] Speaker 3: Oh, okay.

[01:57:34] Speaker 5: You may have noticed that he does not use... He does not speak a lot and definitely does not speak in those Wilkenstien.

[01:57:40] Speaker 2: Is the AC with mystic armor, right?

[01:57:41] Speaker 4: It's okay. Um, yeah-

[01:57:44] Speaker 5: I don't care about all.

[01:57:44] Speaker 3: Okay.

[01:57:44] Speaker 1: She de- and then it's ... The video comes in. It's kind of a... She's too much of a chicken to uh-

[01:57:49] Speaker 3: Ulric's fine with that.

[01:57:50] Speaker 1: Not have that cast. So it's one of the first things she'll always do.

[01:57:53] Speaker 2: Yeah, it lasts until the next day.

[01:57:55] Speaker 1: Yeah. Um, you still-

[01:57:59] Speaker 3: I'm next opponent for fun.

[01:58:01] Speaker 4: Oh, she's a little bitch.

[01:58:03] Speaker 1: She's a little temperamental. You guys haven't caught a sense of her personality yet but...

[01:58:05] Speaker 2: Fuck. I think runic weapon lasts for like... What's that runic last? Oh, it's really short.

[01:58:14] Speaker 5: Minute?

[01:58:15] Speaker 2: Yeah, maybe it's the runic armor that lasts.

[01:58:18] Speaker 5: I mean there's probably like a heightened version that makes it last longer. With a lot of those buffs.

[01:58:24] Speaker 2: Yep.

[01:58:24] Speaker 5: They, they get better at higher level.

[01:58:28] Speaker 2: Nope, doesn't.

[01:58:30] Speaker 5: Mm.

[01:58:31] Speaker 2: There are other spells that give the uh-

[01:58:32] Speaker 5: Oh, okay.

[01:58:33] Speaker 2: ... similar abilities at higher levels.

[01:58:36] Speaker 1: So you guys are approaching a glade coming up in the distance here. Um...

[01:58:41] Speaker 2: Let me put all that stuff around.

[01:58:49] Speaker 1: And you see an opening as you guys are coming this direction. You see an opening coming from you, but you're starting to see a lot of spiderwebs.

[01:58:58] Speaker 2: I think we found the problem.

[01:59:01] Speaker 3: Hold on.

[01:59:01] Speaker 2: Actually it's a little further.

[01:59:03] Speaker 3: This is obviously traps. We better check it out.

[01:59:07] Speaker 5: Oh, this is where we must go. This is where, um... I'm gonna call her Glinda or Glina. Let's call her Glinda 'cause I, I just saw that movie. Looks like that.

[01:59:19] Speaker 3: All these spiderwebs we should burn it all down.

[01:59:22] Speaker 1: So we should see-

[01:59:22] Speaker 3: Make sure that there's no spiders there.

[01:59:23] Speaker 1: There's a lot of trees but into it you can still kind of see... A creature looks kind of like that.

[01:59:28] Speaker 3: Mm.

[01:59:28] Speaker 1: That is, um... There's a bunch of spiderwebs that are kind of keeping her in place actually. We'll move her in between these two. So, there's like two posts and she's been, like tied up kind of in there. So you guys are approaching, you do see...

[01:59:52] Speaker 3: Why like a lot of spiderwebs, like unless spiderwebs too, like impede us or just like annoy us as we walk through?

[01:59:58] Speaker 1: Um, the denser ones but um-

[02:00:01] Speaker 2: You can see a little spider. One or two little spiders that are crawling in the air.

[02:00:08] Speaker 1: Um, you can probably... They won't impede your movement. I mean the stuff, the stuff where she's in is pretty thick that wood but unless you're gonna crawl in between there. So, um, with that you guys have anything you want to do otherwise you can roll initiative as you guys are just at the edge of the map and decide. From there you can decide how you guys want to enter in.

[02:00:32] Speaker 2: It's always gonna fall over and...

[02:00:36] Speaker 3: Wow, you guys don't like you tonight.

[02:00:38] Speaker 2: Mm, I don't like her more. (laughs)

[02:00:41] Speaker 3: Well, mine was much better.

[02:00:43] Speaker 5: It's fine.

[02:00:45] Speaker 3: Did you roll for your Grimnar, Kai? And your Aelish? Do you, do you guys need to roll for them too?

[02:00:50] Speaker 2: Yeah, I already did.

[02:00:51] Speaker 4: Oh, I didn't roll for him. Uh, uh, Ulric.

[02:00:58] Speaker 3: Mine is, uh, 10.

[02:01:01] Speaker 1: Okay.

[02:01:03] Speaker 6: Uh, Kotal.

[02:01:05] Speaker 7: Five.

[02:01:07] Speaker 6: Krimnar.

[02:01:09] Speaker 8: 13.

[02:01:12] Speaker 1: I do see that there's some of those little vine guys you fought earlier, but they seem to be-

[02:01:17] Speaker 6: Could you hand me that leg real quick?

[02:01:17] Speaker 1: ... tangled up in the webs.

[02:01:19] Speaker 7: Where is it?

[02:01:21] Speaker 6: Uh, underneath the, that leg.

[02:01:25] Speaker 7: Oh, I see. Okay.

[02:01:32] Speaker 8: Okay. So-

[02:01:33] Speaker 7: Is this yours or is this mine?

[02:01:34] Speaker 8: Not mine. I don't think. No, not mine.

[02:01:40] Speaker 6: Hm. What's that look like? Is that one of... Hm. I don't know if that's mine or not.

[02:01:45] Speaker 7: My D10s are all-

[02:01:46] Speaker 8: Let's see.

[02:01:46] Speaker 7: ... sort of, like, mixed yellow-purple.

[02:01:49] Speaker 1: So red one has a nine. Red two has a six.

[02:01:58] Speaker 9: Sorry, uh, what'd you say?

[02:01:58] Speaker 1: Uh, red one it had nine, red two had a six.

[02:01:59] Speaker 9: Huh, red one, nine, red two, six.

[02:02:11] Speaker 8: It's two hours. Oh yeah, have I handed out another... Oh. Oh, 55. Where did I go here?

[02:02:19] Speaker 9: I think I'm the only one that used it, so.

[02:02:21] Speaker 6: Oh, yeah. If you're out. I saw you. I've got mine. There you go.

[02:02:24] Speaker 9: Well, now that we know what we can do with resolve points, spend them if you got them.

[02:02:27] Speaker 7: Yeah.

[02:02:28] Speaker 6: Mm.

[02:02:29] Speaker 7: Maybe. That's pretty handy.

[02:02:32] Speaker 6: Yeah. Uh, are... Did you roll for the greens?

[02:02:39] Speaker 1: Um, they haven't entered into initiative. They're tangled up in webs.

[02:02:41] Speaker 6: Okay.

[02:02:42] Speaker 1: You think if you cut them out of the web somehow or they break free, then they might be entering into initiative. On whose side, no one knows.

[02:02:49] Speaker 9: Who knows?

[02:02:54] Speaker 6: Who's first?

[02:02:55] Speaker 9: Uh, sorry. First is Krimnar. On deck is, I guess, Ulric and Braldan Tide. I don't know if you have a preference.

[02:03:09] Speaker 8: Not really.

[02:03:09] Speaker 9: Well. I'll let you go first since it's alphabetical, put you that way.

[02:03:15] Speaker 8: All right. Um, Krimnar will move forward five squares. Straight, whichever one is Krimnar.

[02:03:26] Speaker 9: Which one's Krimnar? There.

[02:03:27] Speaker 8: Oh. I didn't realize he was in line with a post. He will slide over one so he's not in line with a post.

[02:03:34] Speaker 9: (laughs) Fair. Kinda wasn't.

[02:03:38] Speaker 8: One, two, three, four, five, six. One, two, three, four. How far are the posts? What is my straight line distance?

[02:03:48] Speaker 1: Mm. If you wanna get into trigonometry there, about, I'd say 20 feet, we'll say.

[02:03:52] Speaker 8: No. How far is my straight line distance?

[02:03:54] Speaker 9: Oh, yeah.

[02:03:55] Speaker 8: On the... on the ground it's 45 feet.

[02:03:56] Speaker 6: It's 30. It's bridging.

[02:03:58] Speaker 8: Is it 60?

[02:03:59] Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll say it's 60 just to keep things simple.

[02:04:01] Speaker 8: All right. Then he will, um, rapid shot on number one, red one.

[02:04:12] Speaker 1: Krimnar?

[02:04:13] Speaker 8: Yep. Wow. 25.

[02:04:18] Speaker 9: How are you doing range attacks? Oh, wait, that's bow guy.

[02:04:22] Speaker 8: Who?

[02:04:22] Speaker 9: Oh. Yeah. Bow guy's goes home.

[02:04:24] Speaker 8: No.

[02:04:25] Speaker 7: I don't see him as a bow guy.

[02:04:28] Speaker 1: I didn't do the miniature that way, but I brought up the-

[02:04:31] Speaker 7: Oh, yeah. I'm just saying it's like, that's not the impression I got from him was a bow guy.

[02:04:34] Speaker 6: Yeah.

[02:04:34] Speaker 1: He might get tinkered with because I had to... I, I literally drew him up like 20 minutes before the session.

[02:04:39] Speaker 6: Mm-hmm.

[02:04:39] Speaker 1: I knew he was gonna be, but I hadn't drawn up his stats, so.

[02:04:42] Speaker 7: I mean, that's fine. He doesn't-

[02:04:43] Speaker 1: Um, I figured you guys were... The problem is there were so many melee in the party, it's like, I don't know if I can have another NPC that's gonna be a melee part guy, so. Decided to make him more of a hunter guy. Um, what did you say you rolled?

[02:04:53] Speaker 8: 25.

[02:04:54] Speaker 1: Uh, that'll hit either way, even with a range increment.

[02:04:56] Speaker 8: Okay. Um, that was, uh, five points of piercing.

[02:05:01] Speaker 7: Who's he attacking too? One-

[02:05:02] Speaker 8: Number one. It's only one in range. Uh, 13.

[02:05:06] Speaker 1: Goodness.

[02:05:08] Speaker 8: Um, I think he'll just stay there. He can't intimidate spiders. Uh, he's done.

[02:05:19] Speaker 1: Ulric.

[02:05:20] Speaker 7: If it's not written on there, he does have intimidating glare.

[02:05:22] Speaker 8: Okay. Well, then he's-

[02:05:23] Speaker 7: He's out of range.

[02:05:23] Speaker 8: He'll... Oh, it's 30 foot range. Uh, he's still gonna wait. Um, all... or, uh, uh, Kotal. Or, who's far? Kotal or Ulric?

[02:05:32] Speaker 7: Ulric.

[02:05:32] Speaker 8: Ulric. Who did you say?

[02:05:34] Speaker 7: Ulric.

[02:05:35] Speaker 8: Okay. Yeah. So down at the end.

[02:05:37] Speaker 9: Yeah. Kotal's... Yeah, end of the order.

[02:05:40] Speaker 8: (laughs) Oh yeah. 5.

[02:05:40] Speaker 6: He's gonna drop his shield.

[02:05:43] Speaker 7: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

[02:05:48] Speaker 9: What are you gonna do? You gonna attack me if I let you go? You little fucker.

[02:05:52] Speaker 1: I think he, um, is just spurring about in its web.

[02:05:57] Speaker 9: I can't do anything anyway, so-

[02:05:58] Speaker 1: All right.

[02:05:58] Speaker 9: ... I'm just gonna look at him. Oh, that's it for you?

[02:06:02] Speaker 7: Yep.

[02:06:03] Speaker 9: Okay. Uh, me. Uh, we're the ones on deck, by the way. It's, uh, all the way up there, I'm down here. 5, 10, 15, 20. 5, 15, 20. And take cover, is that an action?

[02:06:26] Speaker 8: It is.

[02:06:27] Speaker 9: Sweet. I know how to play.

[02:06:28] Speaker 7: (laughs)

[02:06:29] Speaker 9: Um, I'll take cover.

[02:06:30] Speaker 8: It increases your cover by one. So if you had lesser you get standard-

[02:06:34] Speaker 7: You get half less?

[02:06:35] Speaker 8: No. It increases your amount of c- cover is either +1, +2 or +5. Plus one probably for standing behind a thing. So you went from plus one to plus two.

[02:06:45] Speaker 7: Okay.

[02:06:46] Speaker 9: Cool.

[02:06:46] Speaker 8: Standard cover is what it is probably called in Hero Lab if you really want to add it.

[02:06:50] Speaker 9: I don't. Um, so that's my turn. Next is Radwin. Ailish is on deck.

[02:06:57] Speaker 1: Oh, that's me.

[02:06:58] Speaker 9: Radwin just climbs down and disappears behind some webs.

[02:07:01] Speaker 7: Copycat.

[02:07:03] Speaker 8: Oh, yeah. For the record.Standard cover also increases your reflexes.

[02:07:08] Speaker 9: Oh.

[02:07:08] Speaker 8: I forgot. It's close to the AC and reflex. Re- lesser cover is just plus one AC. Lesser cover's like standing behind a person.

[02:07:14] Speaker 9: (tapping sounds) Oh, what? Oh, okay. Her speed is on.

[02:07:18] Speaker 1: Wow, she's a fast fucker.

[02:07:19] Speaker 9: Okay, um, that was all from-

[02:07:21] Speaker 1: You mean on London? (laughs)

[02:07:21] Speaker 8: Yeah.

[02:07:22] Speaker 1: Um-

[02:07:22] Speaker 8: I'll just get speed.

[02:07:24] Speaker 9: Red Two is on deck. Uh, so five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30. I will take cover and cast glass shield to give myself one armor.

[02:07:37] Speaker 1: Oh, he'll probably use her. I think she first has to cast the mystic armor.

[02:07:41] Speaker 9: Oh, that does protect him.

[02:07:42] Speaker 1: Is that what that is?

[02:07:43] Speaker 9: Well, yeah, but it lasts until, like, the end of the day.

[02:07:46] Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

[02:07:46] Speaker 9: So I figure she just did that way before.

[02:07:48] Speaker 1: So she... Oh, yeah. That's true. Did it when she woke up as well.

[02:07:51] Speaker 9: Mm-hmm.

[02:07:52] Speaker 1: Um, (clicking sound) I didn't put her reaction on the sheet there.

[02:07:55] Speaker 9: That's the new version of age armor.

[02:07:58] Speaker 8: Yeah.

[02:07:58] Speaker 1: Um, she has an item too. Um, (tapping sound) thorn cloak. So, if he ever gets hit, if she gets hit, she can make a...

[02:08:06] Speaker 9: Oh, she has a reaction thing?

[02:08:07] Speaker 1: She has a reaction, yeah. If she's, if she's hit by a melee attack. Yeah.

[02:08:11] Speaker 9: I'll add it in.

[02:08:11] Speaker 1: I forgot. I... So if that comes up, let me know and I'll look up the stats. Yeah.

[02:08:14] Speaker 9: Yeah, I'm looking up the thing in Hero Lab so I can just remember.

[02:08:18] Speaker 1: Um, but yeah-

[02:08:19] Speaker 9: I think it's called Cloak of Thorns.

[02:08:20] Speaker 1: Red Two then calls Hal's on deck. Red Two also climbs down and disappears. Fuckers.

[02:08:28] Speaker 9: Cloak of gnawing leaves? Is that it?

[02:08:30] Speaker 1: Yeah, that might be it.

[02:08:32] Speaker 8: My turn?

[02:08:33] Speaker 9: One way or those characters had it. It's fun fluff.

[02:08:35] Speaker 1: Yeah, it's your turn.

[02:08:36] Speaker 9: Yeah, it's a reaction type thing. The item three, so she makes up for it, half it.

[02:08:45] Speaker 1: Into this row.

[02:08:47] Speaker 9: You couldn't have. Oh, you. Over here. One more. Yeah.

[02:08:53] Speaker 1: And ready. Uh, sorry.

[02:08:58] Speaker 9: All right. And then we don't get to the top of the round.

[02:09:00] Speaker 1: That's top of the round.

[02:09:02] Speaker 9: Oh, right there? Okay. Or he was the top of the round?

[02:09:05] Speaker 1: No, I was the bottom.

[02:09:05] Speaker 9: He was the bottom. Okay.

[02:09:06] Speaker 8: Grenada's on deck after, whatever happens.

[02:09:09] Speaker 1: Um, uh, no. We go right to the next round eight.

[02:09:16] Speaker 8: Yeah. Grenada, all right's on deck.

[02:09:21] Speaker 1: Um, there's nobody visible?

[02:09:23] Speaker 9: Mm, no. Except, except these guys and...

[02:09:26] Speaker 8: Yeah. (instrumental music plays) He will ready a rapid shot if one of those... If a, if a spider appears within 60 feet. He really has nothing else to do. And I don't think he wants to engage, get into melee range, so he's gonna stay there. Maybe he'll center himself a little bit since he's got plenty of action.

[02:09:51] Speaker 9: Okay, hold on.

[02:09:52] Speaker 1: Put him in with the... Yeah, right there. That way he's got good visibility on something popping out. Okay. Who's up next?

[02:10:02] Speaker 9: Or, oh. A fruit ball and smitey. Now, I smack you on your back and you now have runic weapon.

[02:10:08] Speaker 8: Oh, cool.

[02:10:09] Speaker 9: What's that?

[02:10:10] Speaker 8: Uh, makes your weapon plus one striking.

[02:10:12] Speaker 9: Holy shit. Yeah.

[02:10:14] Speaker 8: You should just add it as a spell adjustment. I think it's in there. And then you don't have to mess with your weapon. Yeah. If you had runic weapon.

[02:10:24] Speaker 9: Yeah, I see it now.

[02:10:24] Speaker 8: It'll magic it, it'll update your weapon attacks and damages for you.

[02:10:31] Speaker 9: Lasts for a minute.

[02:10:33] Speaker 8: It lasts for-

[02:10:34] Speaker 9: That will last a while.

[02:10:35] Speaker 8: Hopefully, the combat. And that's great.

[02:10:37] Speaker 9: Yeah. And then I will try to free the thing in front of me and... No, actually I'm going to try to-

[02:10:43] Speaker 1: Oh, yeah. By the way, two of you guys there, well, we'll get to you in a second.

[02:10:47] Speaker 9: I am actually going to try to get a sense of what his-

[02:10:50] Speaker 8: Sense motive.

[02:10:51] Speaker 9: Yeah. Sense his attitude towards me.

[02:10:55] Speaker 8: It's perception. It's just a roll for sense motive. And it is against.

[02:11:04] Speaker 9: Ooh, 17.

[02:11:04] Speaker 8: Deception, deception DC.

[02:11:08] Speaker 9: I think. (laughs)

[02:11:13] Speaker 8: Double check. We never really used it in the last campaign.

[02:11:17] Speaker 9: Nope.

[02:11:23] Speaker 8: It's on, it's on the cheat sheet somewhere.

[02:11:25] Speaker 9: Yeah, it's perception. Perception.

[02:11:27] Speaker 8: But what was it against?

[02:11:28] Speaker 9: (coughs) I don't know if that's on here.

[02:11:31] Speaker 8: It usually says.

[02:11:34] Speaker 9: Um, it's the bottom over there. I rolled a 19.

[02:11:40] Speaker 8: (laughs)

[02:11:40] Speaker 9: Nothing less you wanted to do with secrets.

[02:11:42] Speaker 8: Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah. It's not. Whatever DC you want it to be.

[02:11:50] Speaker 9: Yeah. Um, I'll give it to you 'cause it's pretty obvious. These things are kind of mindless. But right now, it's clawing out at you. You seem to think that it's looking to attack almost anything that's not the well lady. Uh, not the well lady.

[02:12:02] Speaker 1: How do you think that maybe there are ways of, um, either A, you speak Sylvan, or know someone who can? It's definitely not me.

[02:12:12] Speaker 8: Okay.

[02:12:12] Speaker 1: Glances meaningfully at the elf.

[02:12:15] Speaker 9: Uh, I'm sure she doesn't speak it.

[02:12:17] Speaker 1: (laughs) You also coincidentally have two small fey that are hovering, peering behind trees. Oh. One, two, three, four, five, 10, 15, 20. And then the, um, you and Bjorn or, uh, Grimgar, if you guys wanna take a... That thing does have that odor.

[02:12:40] Speaker 9: Oh, oh.

[02:12:41] Speaker 1: That affects everyone, so if you want to...

[02:12:43] Speaker 9: Oh, shit. I forgot about that. Yeah. What's the range?

[02:12:45] Speaker 1: What's the range? 10 feet. So it's not even just the two of you.

[02:12:49] Speaker 9: The, there's three people.

[02:12:51] Speaker 1: She'd be right... You know when she's behind someone?

[02:12:52] Speaker 9: There's another mini behind the pole.

[02:12:54] Speaker 1: I'd say in her case, probably no.

[02:12:56] Speaker 9: Okay. What is it? Is it at 14?

[02:12:58] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[02:12:59] Speaker 9: Okay, I make it.

[02:13:00] Speaker 1: 15?

[02:13:01] Speaker 9: What's the DC?

[02:13:03] Speaker 1: 14.

[02:13:04] Speaker 9: Oh. 18 plus stuff.

[02:13:05] Speaker 1: Oh, yeah. They just flatfoot it this round.I got a weak ass next run, if you're still on that.

[02:13:11] Speaker 8: (coughs)

[02:13:13] Speaker 9: Okay. Um, so (tapping) 5, 10, 15, 20. And then I'll do that two move and attack thing. So 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30. Is that... Do I see him there? Do I get stuck in the abs?

[02:13:29] Speaker 1: Yeah, once you... So you basically there, once you get to here, you'd see him. It is rearing up like it's gonna... I think I'm gonna destroy my own miniature. Um, it's right there. I'm gonna put a small shrub there for now, for sight reasons. It was rearing up and hissing. So once you get to there, it would have a ready action-

[02:13:48] Speaker 8: Yeah.

[02:13:49] Speaker 1: ... to attack but you can also smack it.

[02:13:51] Speaker 9: Yeah.

[02:13:52] Speaker 1: Um-

[02:13:52] Speaker 8: I mean, I'll still move up there.

[02:13:54] Speaker 1: It can-

[02:13:54] Speaker 8: The one for-

[02:13:54] Speaker 1: ... theoretically attack me.

[02:13:55] Speaker 8: Sure, of course but...

[02:13:57] Speaker 1: Well, when you're with, um, the type of opportunity that uses up your reaction so even if it did have reactive strike, it still couldn't do it. You can only get one reaction.

[02:14:05] Speaker 8: Yeah.

[02:14:05] Speaker 1: Ready, ready to use up your action.

[02:14:08] Speaker 9: Okay. Um, ba-dum bum-bum. (laughs) Meleer he has some sharp fangs. Uh-oh.

[02:14:16] Speaker 8: Good.

[02:14:16] Speaker 9: Uh, let's use this dice. Well, he pulls out his, uh, uh, dagger and tries to stab at you. Uh, minute-

[02:14:25] Speaker 8: A spider...

[02:14:25] Speaker 1: (laughs)

[02:14:25] Speaker 8: ... a spider pulls out a dagger?

[02:14:27] Speaker 1: (laughs) Yeah.

[02:14:27] Speaker 8: He's carrying a piece.

[02:14:28] Speaker 9: Holy shit.

[02:14:28] Speaker 1: Um-

[02:14:29] Speaker 9: Some Dark Souls bullshit.

[02:14:30] Speaker 8: (laughs)

[02:14:31] Speaker 1: That would be a 20 to hit.

[02:14:34] Speaker 9: Yeah, that hits.

[02:14:36] Speaker 1: For one point of damage.

[02:14:38] Speaker 9: Ow.

[02:14:39] Speaker 1: They have a D6 but minus two plus two.

[02:14:42] Speaker 9: Hm. Okay, well, uh, I will make my attack for all on that one. Um, does a 17 hit?

[02:14:55] Speaker 1: Uh, it does.

[02:14:56] Speaker 9: Sweet.

[02:14:57] Speaker 1: And you're going to number two.

[02:15:02] Speaker 9: Mm-hmm. Uh, so 20 bludgeoning and three spirit.

[02:15:06] Speaker 1: Wow. This is wow.

[02:15:07] Speaker 9: Yeah.

[02:15:09] Speaker 1: Striking.

[02:15:10] Speaker 9: Conan the Barbarian.

[02:15:11] Speaker 8: I think I've seen it. And that was your reaction last time, he told me that. It's your favorite movie or something like that.

[02:15:20] Speaker 9: I won't say it's my favorite movie but I mean-

[02:15:21] Speaker 8: 100%.

[02:15:21] Speaker 9: It's like, it's like playing games like this-

[02:15:25] Speaker 8: Oh, go on. Yeah.

[02:15:25] Speaker 9: ... and not seeing Conan the Barbarian-

[02:15:27] Speaker 10: (laughs)

[02:15:27] Speaker 9: ... it's like the ultimate like D&D movie.

[02:15:30] Speaker 1: Holy crap. It's dead?

[02:15:32] Speaker 9: (laughs) Yeah.

[02:15:34] Speaker 1: This is a weird addition.

[02:15:36] Speaker 9: I mean, I rolled Max Damage on one of the guys, so.

[02:15:38] Speaker 1: Like the, the, the, by, the bites you fight had 30 hit points. Any guess what the, how many points these guys have?

[02:15:43] Speaker 8: They're spiders and I assumed that there was a shit-ton of them, not just two. So I would have guessed five, seven.

[02:15:48] Speaker 1: Six.

[02:15:49] Speaker 8: Ah.

[02:15:50] Speaker 9: Wow.

[02:15:50] Speaker 8: 'Cause they're... I... It seems like this-

[02:15:52] Speaker 1: This is a-

[02:15:52] Speaker 8: ... is going to overwhelm you, not-

[02:15:54] Speaker 1: Well, actually-

[02:15:55] Speaker 9: Six?

[02:15:55] Speaker 8: ... I mean I'm going through and-

[02:15:56] Speaker 9: Geez.

[02:15:56] Speaker 8: ... cure lab and drawing them up and making sure-

[02:15:59] Speaker 1: This is a-

[02:15:59] Speaker 8: ... they are appropriately leveled.

[02:16:01] Speaker 1: (laughs) Yeah but they're... there's not a super swarm of them either. That's kind of strange. I didn't expect it though.

[02:16:07] Speaker 8: Mm-hmm. Nice.

[02:16:08] Speaker 9: Nice job, Verona.

[02:16:09] Speaker 10: (laughs)

[02:16:10] Speaker 9: And, uh, that's my turn. Red One's on deck. Or Red One's turn.

[02:16:15] Speaker 1: Red One, Red One er-

[02:16:17] Speaker 9: I think we got two off 'cause yeah.

[02:16:19] Speaker 1: And when are we at the top of the order? Give me a reminder when, once we get there.

[02:16:22] Speaker 9: Ah, yeah, that's Grimnar's turn, so we're away.

[02:16:24] Speaker 1: Oh. Um, he would skitter over behind her.

[02:16:28] Speaker 8: For no particular reason, he wants to know the top of the order and this is an appropriately difficult encounter-

[02:16:33] Speaker 1: (laughs)

[02:16:33] Speaker 8: ... with only two monsters, no.

[02:16:35] Speaker 9: Yeah. (laughs) You know, they gave us a plus one striking-

[02:16:37] Speaker 10: Oh, sure.

[02:16:37] Speaker 9: ... weapon for no reason at all.

[02:16:39] Speaker 8: Oh, I'm sure there's nothing else here.

[02:16:41] Speaker 1: Um, that's only a 10.

[02:16:43] Speaker 9: Yeah.

[02:16:43] Speaker 1: We'll take another bite or no wait.

[02:16:46] Speaker 9: And like added like four members to our party.

[02:16:50] Speaker 1: Well...

[02:16:50] Speaker 9: (laughs)

[02:16:51] Speaker 10: (laughs)

[02:16:52] Speaker 1: It's going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience.

[02:16:55] Speaker 9: Yeah.

[02:16:56] Speaker 8: These are just the baby spiders. (laughs)

[02:17:00] Speaker 10: (laughs)

[02:17:00] Speaker 9: What do you think about that?

[02:17:02] Speaker 10: Wait 'til it pulls out the she-lab.

[02:17:03] Speaker 1: Well, actually first thing we do try to spit ve- um, a web at you which would miss horribly then it would move up and try to bite you.

[02:17:09] Speaker 9: Okay.

[02:17:09] Speaker 1: So the web was the first one that missed horribly, the bite isn't much better it's only a 13.

[02:17:15] Speaker 9: What do you think about spell casters-

[02:17:16] Speaker 1: That's a crit.

[02:17:16] Speaker 9: ... not having any spells at lower levels?

[02:17:18] Speaker 10: Um, I ask for no particular reason but I never did get full healed but I did get treat wounds. Does that still remove wounded?

[02:17:24] Speaker 8: Treat wounds removes wounded.

[02:17:25] Speaker 9: Yep.

[02:17:26] Speaker 8: No matter how much it heals. To remove wounded with healing, you have to be healed to full.

[02:17:30] Speaker 9: Yeah, yeah. Um, so next stop is Ailish. Kotal is on deck. Oh, I'm Ailish, ah. Okay, she's a speedy fucker, right?

[02:17:40] Speaker 10: Yep.

[02:17:41] Speaker 9: Uh, okay. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35.

[02:17:47] Speaker 11: So, I guess that'll force the habit in. We actually wait long enough to-

[02:17:50] Speaker 1: Now if you look, there is a ton of webs that are holding her.

[02:17:52] Speaker 9: ... uh, kill the way? Yeah.

[02:17:52] Speaker 1: So she'd have a hard time going through that.

[02:17:53] Speaker 8: Even if you didn't

[02:17:53] Speaker 12: Oh, no.

[02:17:55] Speaker 10: (laughs) I was gonna say 'cause I, I just saw in the background-

[02:17:57] Speaker 9: Can I try and like (air whoosh) ... think about it, take the webs off her?

[02:18:00] Speaker 1: Yeah, she could do that.

[02:18:01] Speaker 9: Mm-hmm.

[02:18:01] Speaker 1: Um, she could just spin around and... or if she, if she, was that one action you thought or two?

[02:18:06] Speaker 9: I think it would be, uh, let me double check. Uh, well, when would difficult terrain start?

[02:18:12] Speaker 1: Um, Ailish is generally free. You can move through most of the webs that are here.

[02:18:16] Speaker 9: Oh, then you-

[02:18:17] Speaker 1: But with her, she's kind of tied up between the two poles.

[02:18:20] Speaker 9: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35. Oh, I'm see- so you're just saying it would be hard to get through here.

[02:18:25] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[02:18:26] Speaker 9: Uh, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35. Okay, so she got here in one action, um, 5, 10, 15 and-

[02:18:35] Speaker 10: That's a trap.

[02:18:35] Speaker 1: She could spend some time-

[02:18:37] Speaker 9: Yeah, if she could spend an action getting rid of those webs.

[02:18:39] Speaker 10: You should burn 'em.

[02:18:40] Speaker 1: She thinks if she spent two more actions, like one more action kind of in front and one action from the side, um, she could clear her entirely. So she has one but as she's clearing this web right here-

[02:18:52] Speaker 9: Mm-hmm.

[02:18:52] Speaker 1: ... a creature would enter into initiative-

[02:18:54] Speaker 11: Hold on. Hold on.

[02:18:54] Speaker 1: ... and it can't really step after her.

[02:18:56] Speaker 9: Okay. Kotal is still on deck before the top of the round, as far as we're... oh.

[02:19:00] Speaker 8: How does she look?

[02:19:01] Speaker 1: So a little spider, this looks like a skull, jumps out of the tree at her.

[02:19:06] Speaker 9: All right. (laughs)

[02:19:10] Speaker 1: So, you can just put, um, skull spider in a, initiative that follows hers.

[02:19:16] Speaker 13: Okay.

[02:19:16] Speaker 1: Um, so one action to hop down at her. (instrumental music) Actually, the first thing it will do is spit a web at her, and then it will try to jump on her and bite her. So the web first. It's only an 11.

[02:19:33] Speaker 13: It misses.

[02:19:34] Speaker 1: Um, then he would try to hop down and bite her anyways, which is not very good. He has 16.

[02:19:41] Speaker 13: Um, that just hits.

[02:19:43] Speaker 1: Okay. It does. Three points. Um... (instrumental music)

[02:19:51] Speaker 13: And this was a melee attack?

[02:19:53] Speaker 1: Yep.

[02:19:53] Speaker 13: Then I will use her cloak of the nod leaves. Um... (instrumental music)

[02:19:58] Speaker 1: I think it has to take a save again.

[02:20:00] Speaker 13: Yeah, DC17 reflex saving throw.

[02:20:02] Speaker 1: (three dice clatter) It fails.

[02:20:04] Speaker 13: Okay.

[02:20:05] Speaker 1: As a matter of fact, I think it's... Nope, it does not crit fail.

[02:20:10] Speaker 13: Okay. Yeah, apparently it takes wounding damage if it crit fails. (three dice clatter)

[02:20:15] Speaker 1: Um, but it still takes four piercing damage.

[02:20:17] Speaker 13: Oh.

[02:20:18] Speaker 1: Uh, it had six health, right?

[02:20:20] Speaker 13: God.

[02:20:20] Speaker 1: (laughs)

[02:20:21] Speaker 13: This one has more.

[02:20:23] Speaker 1: Oh.

[02:20:23] Speaker 13: So apparently it's different.

[02:20:24] Speaker 1: Skull, skull.

[02:20:25] Speaker 13: It's a different spider.

[02:20:27] Speaker 1: Um, so she then has a, take a fortitude saving throw-

[02:20:30] Speaker 13: Oh.

[02:20:30] Speaker 1: ... because they have injected her with some venom.

[02:20:32] Speaker 13: Shit. Okay. Oh, that's a nat 20, uh-

[02:20:36] Speaker 1: Oh.

[02:20:36] Speaker 13: ... plus... Yeah, 24.

[02:20:38] Speaker 1: Yeah, she's had spider venom for dinner. She's, uh, n- you know, no effect on her.

[02:20:42] Speaker 13: That is very rude of you. Is it okay to role play as her or is-

[02:20:46] Speaker 1: Oh, yeah. No, you can.

[02:20:47] Speaker 13: ... am I stepping on your toes?

[02:20:50] Speaker 1: Each character does have some kind of personality. I... They're not... It's not their personality, but it's usually when I try to talk with them. Have you guys ever played Borderlands?

[02:20:56] Speaker 13: No.

[02:20:57] Speaker 1: Okay. Well, we'll get that one reference then. Um, wait, I had two incidences with her. What was the other? (two dice clatter) Ah, it'll come to me.

[02:21:08] Speaker 13: I'm gonna smack you for that later.

[02:21:09] Speaker 1: (laughs)

[02:21:10] Speaker 13: And that's her turn and that skull spider's turn. Next is Kotal. And that will be at the end of their round.

[02:21:16] Speaker 8: Oh, one, two, three, four, five. I can get right in front of the bush with one diagonal move.

[02:21:24] Speaker 1: Right there?

[02:21:25] Speaker 8: Yeah. Is that close enough to reach the web or do I need to move one more that way?

[02:21:29] Speaker 1: Um, I'd say that if, you could effect... So there'll be... There's three elements of webs. There's this one, this one, and then one that's all on the-

[02:21:33] Speaker 8: No, I'm gonna take care of the one that's-

[02:21:35] Speaker 1: Where you're at.

[02:21:35] Speaker 8: ... right there with one action and my third action is to parry in case something jumps out at me too.

[02:21:40] Speaker 1: Okay. Two webs down. You then hear... You hear some weird screeching.

[02:21:49] Speaker 13: (rapid music) Yeah.

[02:21:50] Speaker 1: Coming out of the, uh, thing. And a creature kind of looks like this.

[02:21:55] Speaker 13: Ah.

[02:21:55] Speaker 8: Hello.

[02:21:56] Speaker 13: It's definitely not a-

[02:21:57] Speaker 1: Walks by.

[02:21:58] Speaker 13: ... spider.

[02:21:59] Speaker 1: The trees, so...

[02:22:00] Speaker 8: Mm-hmm.

[02:22:00] Speaker 1: It spoke and there's one action to get there.

[02:22:04] Speaker 14: What position is 12 again? Shh.

[02:22:06] Speaker 8: I can't remember off the top of my head.

[02:22:07] Speaker 14: Just out of the top of initiative?

[02:22:09] Speaker 8: Yeah. You haven't played Baldur's Gate 3 enough.

[02:22:12] Speaker 14: Oh, I know exactly what it is. It's just-

[02:22:13] Speaker 8: And then another creature will enter in on initiative.

[02:22:19] Speaker 14: Oh, I, I remember now. Yeah. This guy was in Baldur's Gate 3.

[02:22:23] Speaker 8: Um, yeah.

[02:22:24] Speaker 1: On initiative, it's between New Ground's, um, level that we're in.

[02:22:26] Speaker 8: Some of them were, I assume. It, it looks kind of like it, yeah. Maybe not. I can't tell.

[02:22:32] Speaker 1: Mm-hmm. It sees...

[02:22:34] Speaker 13: It's been too long since I've played it, I remember.

[02:22:36] Speaker 14: In the spider cavern.

[02:22:37] Speaker 1: Sees you messing with its web.

[02:22:38] Speaker 8: With the spiders?

[02:22:40] Speaker 1: I think it would-

[02:22:41] Speaker 13: Oh.

[02:22:41] Speaker 1: I think it's... Oh, yeah. Kind of angry against you. Since you just opened up that web.

[02:22:47] Speaker 8: It's, yeah, it's clear.

[02:22:48] Speaker 1: Conveniently just walked right up there. He's none too pleased you did with his handiwork.

[02:22:53] Speaker 13: Gremnar's on deck, by the way.

[02:22:56] Speaker 1: Um, just a minute, because I think he's gonna shoot a web at you first. Is that a reflex?

[02:23:03] Speaker 13: I've seen it. It just came out with another patch for it-

[02:23:05] Speaker 14: Yeah, I gotta see how that-

[02:23:05] Speaker 13: ... actually. Yeah, they added like a 200 or so classes.

[02:23:07] Speaker 8: It's on attack roll.

[02:23:09] Speaker 14: Like official ones.

[02:23:10] Speaker 8: Yep.

[02:23:10] Speaker 14: Even though they had like, patches but... Or like, mods, but now they're official.

[02:23:14] Speaker 8: Mm-hmm.

[02:23:15] Speaker 13: Yeah.

[02:23:16] Speaker 14: What? Baldur's Gate?

[02:23:17] Speaker 1: Yeah, he's gonna shoot a web at you first.

[02:23:18] Speaker 8: But they're the same mods, they're just now officially supported and there's a UI to add them from inside the game.

[02:23:23] Speaker 14: Oh.

[02:23:23] Speaker 1: Uh, 22 to hit.

[02:23:24] Speaker 8: Hit. (die clatters) Try to attack or the web?

[02:23:28] Speaker 13: Norian Studios is making a YouTube video of their Dark Urge play through.

[02:23:32] Speaker 14: Oh.

[02:23:32] Speaker 13: They're using like, the sexy Astarion mod, which just gives him like really pouty lips.

[02:23:36] Speaker 8: Oh, really?

[02:23:37] Speaker 13: Yeah.

[02:23:37] Speaker 8: Oh, Astarion, right. Yeah.

[02:23:38] Speaker 13: Nope. That's why they came along. I like it a lot.

[02:23:44] Speaker 8: I've done it like eight times. I think that can be done.

[02:23:46] Speaker 1: You are hit by-

[02:23:47] Speaker 8: I was tempted to play again with the Shadow Monk or whatever they added in.

[02:23:51] Speaker 1: With this one-

[02:23:51] Speaker 14: Yeah, all the new subclasses.

[02:23:52] Speaker 8: I am what?

[02:23:53] Speaker 1: So you are hit by a, by its web attack. You are immobilized and stuck to no surface until you succeed a acrobatics check.

[02:24:01] Speaker 13: I'm curious to see what the, oh, the modders do, like..........................

[02:24:04] Speaker 1: And then he's going to take an attack on you with his-

[02:24:06] Speaker 13: Like adventures that they make and stuff?

[02:24:08] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[02:24:08] Speaker 13: That's what I'm curious to see.

[02:24:10] Speaker 1: They... Like, they provided the modding tools for that kind of thing.

[02:24:11] Speaker 8: Yeah.

[02:24:12] Speaker 1: So.

[02:24:12] Speaker 8: He's gonna try to bite you with his fangs.

[02:24:14] Speaker 13: Exactly. I heard there was like a project to create Curse of Strahd in it.

[02:24:17] Speaker 8: Does Mobilize make me?

[02:24:17] Speaker 1: Watch, would you?

[02:24:18] Speaker 13: Awesome.

[02:24:18] Speaker 8: Sorry, does what say?

[02:24:19] Speaker 13: That psychotic dude just-

[02:24:21] Speaker 1: One of my favorite all time adventures. It's just a lot of fun.

[02:24:23] Speaker 8: Isn't immobilize the same as being, um...

[02:24:25] Speaker 13: Just 'cause you can't use any actions to like, move or-

[02:24:26] Speaker 8: I can play that, but almost like in every condition. (laughs)

[02:24:30] Speaker 1: Maybe I'm thinking about it a couple higher.

[02:24:31] Speaker 8: There's things about it.

[02:24:32] Speaker 13: Yeah, I think restrained. Just be careful.

[02:24:34] Speaker 1: Just as immobilized, so... Um, so you still need a 20.

[02:24:39] Speaker 13: The only nice thing about it is-

[02:24:41] Speaker 1: This will be his second attack, however-

[02:24:42] Speaker 13: Is Runes on this table?

[02:24:43] Speaker 1: And it is not gonna be a 20.

[02:24:44] Speaker 13: 'Cause it says Radmus, so it's not-

[02:24:45] Speaker 1: Try it.

[02:24:45] Speaker 13: ... exactly the same.

[02:24:46] Speaker 1: You're up... Well, I'm up. Grimnar.

[02:24:48] Speaker 13: Grimnar, yeah.

[02:24:48] Speaker 1: Grimnar sees this creature-

[02:24:50] Speaker 13: I just heard Strahd's a really fun villain, the way he interacts with the party.

[02:24:53] Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

[02:24:54] Speaker 8: Grimnar doesn't care.

[02:24:55] Speaker 13: He is.

[02:24:55] Speaker 8: He's... Well, he's going, uh... Can he move forward or is he gonna shoot? Since he already had an action to shoot, creatures that came within 60 feet.

[02:25:06] Speaker 1: With spiders. He's gonna move forward three.

[02:25:09] Speaker 13: Well, a spider could-

[02:25:12] Speaker 15: ... big glare on the scary looking thing.

[02:25:15] Speaker 16: The Bone Spidey would have attacked if opportunity had presented itself.

[02:25:17] Speaker 17: Yeah, that's Will?

[02:25:18] Speaker 15: Or as ready to action.

[02:25:19] Speaker 17: Ready to action?

[02:25:19] Speaker 15: I was... Yeah. That was like a round and a half ago.

[02:25:22] Speaker 17: Yeah, that's close. I haven't got since he showed up.

[02:25:24] Speaker 15: So that is, uh, against will DC?

[02:25:26] Speaker 17: Bone Spidey's on deck.

[02:25:26] Speaker 15: Oh, yeah.

[02:25:27] Speaker 17: It is not gonna succeed, uh, nine.

[02:25:30] Speaker 15: Oh.

[02:25:30] Speaker 17: Anything, unless you've got a negative one. (laughs)

[02:25:33] Speaker 18: (laughs)

[02:25:33] Speaker 15: A negative two plus 10, it'll still beat the nine. Um, and then he will, uh, rapid shot. Uh, two dice. That is a thir- it's 15. That would miss. That is a 18. That would hit. Three points of piercing. He has no bonuses. It's a shitty short sword.

[02:26:00] Speaker 18: Yeah, it's 'cause he sucks at all the roles. Yeah.

[02:26:01] Speaker 15: He needs a composite. Probably needs a composite. He didn't put attributes here.

[02:26:05] Speaker 18: Yeah.

[02:26:05] Speaker 15: I assume he's got a... He's got a plus one on damage on short swords, so he must have a plus one strength.

[02:26:10] Speaker 18: Well, I don't know what level he is, but I mean, there's also no striking on it, so...

[02:26:14] Speaker 15: Yeah, dodge him, pass.

[02:26:17] Speaker 18: All right, Ulric. All right. Burn it! You gotta burn it all! And Ulric pulls out a torch and starts strapping on to the end of his 10-foot pole and lighting it up, getting ready to charge.

[02:26:28] Speaker 17: Oh, burn the spriggan.

[02:26:31] Speaker 1: So that'd be two actions. You could still have a third action if you want. I'm gonna say one to withdraw it, one to attach it and then-

[02:26:36] Speaker 18: Okay. Well, then-

[02:26:36] Speaker 15: Uh, light the torch.

[02:26:37] Speaker 1: He'll light the other project for you.

[02:26:43] Speaker 18: Okay, good. My turn. Um, where are the webs? Damn kids.

[02:26:50] Speaker 9: Uh, one action to, uh... 15. Could I get here and-

[02:26:57] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[02:26:57] Speaker 9: ... and get off the webs?

[02:26:58] Speaker 1: Yeah, you can get there any percent with your third action. Or spend an action to get off your last webs.

[02:27:03] Speaker 9: Yeah.

[02:27:04] Speaker 18: What is the dryad doing? Oh, it's stuck in the web.

[02:27:07] Speaker 1: She's thrashing a little bit.

[02:27:08] Speaker 16: What is she like-

[02:27:09] Speaker 1: But now she's-

[02:27:09] Speaker 16: ... reacting or saying anything or doing anything?

[02:27:12] Speaker 1: She's, well, see now she can.

[02:27:13] Speaker 9: She seems conscious and is moving?

[02:27:14] Speaker 1: And at the end of the round might do stuff.

[02:27:15] Speaker 18: Yeah. I'm just wondering if, like, has she gone crazy?

[02:27:18] Speaker 16: But she's awake.

[02:27:19] Speaker 18: Is she gonna attack us?

[02:27:19] Speaker 1: Oh, yeah. She's awake. Um...

[02:27:22] Speaker 18: Has she been corrupted?

[02:27:23] Speaker 1: Um-

[02:27:24] Speaker 9: Let's find out.

[02:27:26] Speaker 1: When was... Try any knowledge checks. Yes.

[02:27:28] Speaker 9: I haven't had any spare actions.

[02:27:30] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[02:27:30] Speaker 9: And he doesn't have nature or anything appropriate.

[02:27:32] Speaker 1: Yeah, I didn't put those all in there.

[02:27:34] Speaker 9: He's got skills, but just not knowledge skills.

[02:27:35] Speaker 18: I can reach the ugly from here, right?

[02:27:37] Speaker 1: What's that?

[02:27:37] Speaker 18: I can reach the ugly guy from here, right?

[02:27:39] Speaker 1: Yep. And you have flank too.

[02:27:41] Speaker 18: Oh. Oh, look at that.

[02:27:43] Speaker 1: Well, I don't want that. (laughs)

[02:27:48] Speaker 18: Is that what you get, one?

[02:27:50] Speaker 9: No, I got a two, then I rolled again and I got a two.

[02:27:53] Speaker 1: Then you get to roll again.

[02:27:54] Speaker 18: Oh, yeah.

[02:27:54] Speaker 9: Because it's now a five. Yeah.

[02:27:55] Speaker 1: Use your hero point and it's five or below.

[02:27:57] Speaker 9: All right. Keep going until you get back into five or below.

[02:28:00] Speaker 18: That is a 19 to hit.

[02:28:01] Speaker 9: Yeah, it will hit.

[02:28:01] Speaker 18: Oh, that's better.

[02:28:05] Speaker 9: And you got flank too, so... Okay, um, so that is 22 bludgeoning and three spirits.

[02:28:13] Speaker 1: Wow. Wow.

[02:28:13] Speaker 9: Three spirits.

[02:28:13] Speaker 15: He's got plus one striking for this one.

[02:28:14] Speaker 9: 22 and three would be-

[02:28:15] Speaker 16: Yes.

[02:28:16] Speaker 18: Yeah, 25.

[02:28:17] Speaker 9: 25.

[02:28:18] Speaker 18: That's plus striking.

[02:28:19] Speaker 16: Yeah, it's a blow thing.

[02:28:22] Speaker 9: You got a new best friend here.

[02:28:23] Speaker 16: This is gonna be nice to this old man who likes to swear.

[02:28:26] Speaker 1: Ulric, my friends call me brah.

[02:28:28] Speaker 16: (laughs)

[02:28:28] Speaker 1: Call me brah. And that's my turn. Uh, Red One's turn. Is Red One still alive?

[02:28:34] Speaker 15: Yes.

[02:28:34] Speaker 9: Yep.

[02:28:34] Speaker 15: He's hiding behind the pole.

[02:28:36] Speaker 18: I keep thinking Star Wars when you hear a Red One.

[02:28:38] Speaker 1: He's gonna scurry over.

[02:28:39] Speaker 18: Yeah, so am I. (laughs)

[02:28:40] Speaker 16: Red Leader.

[02:28:41] Speaker 1: So he has you kind of flanking it and he is going to... I think he's just gonna go straight for an attack.

[02:28:46] Speaker 9: Yeah, that's fair.

[02:28:46] Speaker 15: Did you free the dryad on your turn?

[02:28:48] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[02:28:48] Speaker 15: Yep.

[02:28:48] Speaker 9: Okay.

[02:28:49] Speaker 16: (tapping) Oh, he will miss horribly on his attack even with flank. And his second attack he'll miss even more horribly than he did the first time.

[02:29:00] Speaker 9: Yay.

[02:29:04] Speaker 16: Um, so next up is Aelys, me, crap. Uh, Skull Spider's on deck. Aelys is gonna go for the Skull Spider. Um, so it'll do its, uh...

[02:29:16] Speaker 18: Sheath point.

[02:29:17] Speaker 16: Sheath, it'll do a thorn whip and that trippy thing. Um, so I think it has to, uh...

[02:29:24] Speaker 1: So you'll take, um, basically an athletics check versus its, uh...

[02:29:27] Speaker 18: Maybe I need to change weapons.

[02:29:27] Speaker 9: Oh, okay.

[02:29:28] Speaker 18: A trip is just the athletics versus its reflex DC.

[02:29:30] Speaker 9: Well, it doesn't... It's something else would fit my guy better, I think.

[02:29:34] Speaker 16: Uh, 13.

[02:29:38] Speaker 1: It's reflex? Oh, no. That one missed.

[02:29:43] Speaker 9: Okay. Whoa. Um, what else can she do? Are you looking okay?

[02:29:50] Speaker 15: Yeah.

[02:29:51] Speaker 9: I'm untouched.

[02:29:52] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[02:29:53] Speaker 9: You guys haven't really done much to me, guys.

[02:29:53] Speaker 15: I've been immobilized but I am not hurt.

[02:29:56] Speaker 9: All right. Um, I will just try and attack these

[02:29:59] Speaker 19: Well, if you have to move anywhere, it doesn't matter.

[02:30:01] Speaker 9: He doesn't like to be immobilized.

[02:30:02] Speaker 19: Okay, um, 15?

[02:30:05] Speaker 9: Um, that's a miss.

[02:30:07] Speaker 19: That's a miss. Okay.

[02:30:08] Speaker 17: Uh, third eye shield. Third eye shield.

[02:30:10] Speaker 9: Oh.

[02:30:10] Speaker 17: I got you.

[02:30:12] Speaker 9: Uh, who's that?

[02:30:13] Speaker 17: Oh, that's right, the Dream Spider.

[02:30:14] Speaker 9: Uh, the Skull Spider.

[02:30:16] Speaker 17: Skull slash Dream Spider.

[02:30:18] Speaker 16: (laughs) Dream Spider? What's a Dream Spider?

[02:30:22] Speaker 9: That's a knowledge check.

[02:30:23] Speaker 16: (laughs)

[02:30:26] Speaker 1: I gotta remember when I write, print out these sheets, I gotta rewrite the names if I'm reper- if I'm repurposing them. Um, yes, it's gonna go straight up and attack.

[02:30:34] Speaker 9: On whom?

[02:30:36] Speaker 1: Uh, Aelys.

[02:30:36] Speaker 18: Probably Aelys.

[02:30:39] Speaker 1: Well, it's gonna miss horribly. It'll attack again. This venom can be nasty if it hits.

[02:30:46] Speaker 15: Yeah, that's a good one.

[02:30:47] Speaker 1: Um, that would be an 18.

[02:30:48] Speaker 9: That would just hit.

[02:30:50] Speaker 1: Um, so it would... She'd take two points of damage.

[02:30:53] Speaker 9: And? Okay. That's all of her stamina.

[02:30:56] Speaker 15: Of course, yeah. Of course.

[02:30:56] Speaker 1: And then she has some venom, so 14.

[02:31:00] Speaker 9: Even if she already passed it before?

[02:31:01] Speaker 1: Yep. Yeah.

[02:31:02] Speaker 9: That's a two hit by Enugos.

[02:31:04] Speaker 15: That's a tell there, I think.

[02:31:05] Speaker 9: That's a two on the die, so... Yeah, that's, uh, six.

[02:31:09] Speaker 1: Um, let me see if it has...

[02:31:11] Speaker 9: Aelys should be hardly doing anything.

[02:31:14] Speaker 8: He's, uh-

[02:31:15] Speaker 1: So basically it's gonna go into stage two. So she is stupefied, one. I don't think that'll affect her any. And, um, she has poison damage.

[02:31:27] Speaker 3: Okay. How much poison?

[02:31:28] Speaker 1: Um, just DC for six resistance. So let's do it once for one round. Two points of poison damage.

[02:31:33] Speaker 3: Okay.

[02:31:33] Speaker 1: That's not that much. She, she took two points, not she has two points.

[02:31:38] Speaker 8: Yeah. And she has a cloak.

[02:31:42] Speaker 3: Oh, yeah, totally forgot about that. Uh, so reaction was at DC17.

[02:31:47] Speaker 8: Yeah.

[02:31:47] Speaker 3: Thingamabob.

[02:31:47] Speaker 8: She said last time.

[02:31:48] Speaker 3: Yeah.

[02:31:49] Speaker 20: How often does that? Can you use that?

[02:31:50] Speaker 3: Uh, once per day. So never mind-

[02:31:53] Speaker 20: Oh.

[02:31:53] Speaker 3: ... she has nothing.

[02:31:54] Speaker 8: That's a good point.

[02:31:55] Speaker 3: That is her turn. Next up is Kotal.

[02:31:59] Speaker 8: Kotal will-

[02:32:00] Speaker 3: Dryad.

[02:32:01] Speaker 8: ... she says an acrobatic checks to break free.

[02:32:04] Speaker 3: Um.

[02:32:05] Speaker 8: Oh.

[02:32:05] Speaker 20: Athletics or strength?

[02:32:07] Speaker 8: He said acrobatics. I didn't know if it was special or if it was a normal escape.

[02:32:10] Speaker 1: It says a D18 acrobatics check. But usually you... I would say the other methods count. That doesn't make any sense that it wouldn't. Move athletics and if you don't have athletics you're pretty much screwed.

[02:32:30] Speaker 8: I'm... (laughs) Trust me, I have athletics and acrobatics and a very good unarmed attack. Uh-

[02:32:36] Speaker 1: Uh, it says acrobatics, but, yeah, I mean, I would say that, I would say either or plus, uh-

[02:32:40] Speaker 8: If, uh, Kotal does his, like, does definitely not like being restrained even though... Is this a attack? Right?

[02:32:48] Speaker 1: Yeah, it would be considered an attack for him to escape with.

[02:32:51] Speaker 8: He's still, um... Nah, he's gonna, he's gonna start by... Since he, it doesn't stop him from attacking, he's gonna bonk the guy who webbed him first.

[02:33:05] Speaker 3: Mm.

[02:33:05] Speaker 8: No, there's no chance that a 12 hits. 16.

[02:33:14] Speaker 3: Plus?

[02:33:15] Speaker 8: That's it.

[02:33:16] Speaker 3: Blank. Which hits.

[02:33:17] Speaker 8: Oh, is it blank?

[02:33:19] Speaker 3: Yep, yeah, with me.

[02:33:19] Speaker 8: I did not see that. Uh, that is a bludgeoning.

[02:33:25] Speaker 1: Um, that would... What happens basically?

[02:33:27] Speaker 8: Yay. Um, I mean, it was a staff squarely to the side of his head, so he probably just-

[02:33:34] Speaker 3: Oh.

[02:33:34] Speaker 8: ... slumps, slumps to the ground. Um, and then he will, you know, vigorously attempt to, um, break free. What did you say the DC was?

[02:33:52] Speaker 1: Nine or 18.

[02:33:53] Speaker 3: (laughs) That was so close.

[02:33:54] Speaker 8: The second that was on an 18. Um, that's still, it would've been minus one, so it would've been a 17. No, no, that's not good. Not with minus 10 or minus eight 'cause it's actual.

[02:34:06] Speaker 20: Yeah, if they're attacking.

[02:34:07] Speaker 1: So once it falls, you guys notice the spiders that are there start to, um, lose focus, so to speak.

[02:34:13] Speaker 8: Mm, how do you-

[02:34:14] Speaker 1: And then she begins to say something. I know it's not part, not the end of the round. Oh, no, you were at the end of the round.

[02:34:18] Speaker 3: Yeah, it is the end of the round. She's about there.

[02:34:19] Speaker 1: So she gets to say something, um, somewhat angrily. And the little guys over there that were staring at you, trying to grab at you, um, turn around. It looks like they're kind of pointed now angrily at the spiders. But for the sake of time, the spiders just skitter off. Assuming you'll let them.

[02:34:38] Speaker 8: Indeed.

[02:34:39] Speaker 3: Yeah.

[02:34:39] Speaker 8: Yeah.

[02:34:40] Speaker 1: So they start scurrying away.

[02:34:43] Speaker 8: And then presumably I will eventually break free.

[02:34:46] Speaker 3: If I... I got you. Ah! I charge over with my 10-foot pole.

[02:34:51] Speaker 8: I have reached and as you get close, I trip you.

[02:34:54] Speaker 3: 10 feet. (laughs)

[02:34:57] Speaker 8: Oh.

[02:34:57] Speaker 3: And I burn his webs loose.

[02:34:59] Speaker 8: That is a 25-

[02:35:00] Speaker 20: Oh.

[02:35:00] Speaker 8: ... against your, uh, reflex DC.

[02:35:02] Speaker 3: Nope, 'cause I am not moving any farther, 'cause I got a 10-foot pole. So I got reach. Just as long as you, so I'm not actually moving through any, out of this crap, just moving into it. Yeah, but if he has 10-foot reach and you have 10-foot reach, the arch is still within-

[02:35:20] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[02:35:20] Speaker 3: So I moved in, but I don't trigger because it's my action, not his.

[02:35:23] Speaker 8: No, I had a readied action.

[02:35:25] Speaker 3: No, 'cause you went your turn and this is my turn now. (laughs)

[02:35:29] Speaker 8: Uh, 25 against your DC.

[02:35:30] Speaker 1: And I'm burning his webs free.

[02:35:32] Speaker 8: You're on the ground. You're on the ground.

[02:35:33] Speaker 20: (laughs)

[02:35:33] Speaker 1: You use legendary resistance.

[02:35:34] Speaker 3: Yep. My layer action.

[02:35:36] Speaker 1: Ah, my friends, it is good to-

[02:35:38] Speaker 3: (laughs)

[02:35:38] Speaker 1: ... see such roughhousing among peers.

[02:35:40] Speaker 3: (laughs)

[02:35:41] Speaker 1: (laughs)

[02:35:43] Speaker 3: Burn them all down.

[02:35:45] Speaker 20: Um, I think the dryad is on our side.

[02:35:47] Speaker 3: There's webs everywhere.

[02:35:48] Speaker 20: Oh, the webs sure. Yeah.

[02:35:50] Speaker 3: Burn the spiders.

[02:35:51] Speaker 20: I don't think the dryads will be totally cool with fire is all I'm saying.

[02:35:54] Speaker 3: Well, it's only a little fire.

[02:35:57] Speaker 8: Mm.

[02:35:59] Speaker 3: Mm.

[02:36:00] Speaker 1: (laughs) So you guys, um, finish it off. The dryad starts, um, speaking. Um, I will at some point look up her name, but that doesn't really-

[02:36:11] Speaker 3: (laughs)

[02:36:12] Speaker 1: ... matter at this point. Um...

[02:36:15] Speaker 8: Do we understand her?

[02:36:16] Speaker 3: Start with a G.

[02:36:17] Speaker 1: Um, actually no, unless you speak Sylvan or Spriggan.

[02:36:20] Speaker 8: What?

[02:36:20] Speaker 1: Obviously is in this world.

[02:36:21] Speaker 8: Presumably our elf friend can translate.

[02:36:23] Speaker 3: Yes, Eilish.

[02:36:24] Speaker 1: Um, she does as do the, the fairies-

[02:36:26] Speaker 3: Fairies.

[02:36:26] Speaker 1: ... who are, um, jumping in and about and flying all over her, the vines that make up her hair. Um, Eilish will look over and say, um, she begins her best, uh, thing at, uh, doing, at, uh, translating as best she can. Um, yeah, she is, uh, immensely glad for what you guys have done. Um, been willing to help out a creature such as herself from such vile, um, beings that would control spiders and force them to do their will. Um, she is, um, very honored to have you here. Um, she strides back to one of the trees, you hear kind of a breaking sound. Reaches out and hands something to you guys. Um, (clears throat) it is a club. (book slams)

Not just any club. Well, it's a mace, technically.

[02:37:20] Speaker 21: A wood club.

[02:37:21] Speaker 8: Well, there you go. And you wanted a different weapon. It fit it better.

[02:37:24] Speaker 22: No, no.

[02:37:24] Speaker 1: So, if you guys, um, you guys have, uh, what was it? Crafting?

[02:37:27] Speaker 8: I have crafting.

[02:37:28] Speaker 1: If you wanna check, you can check and see if you can figure out what it is. She'll hand it to you. It's a fine. It's made of branches. Um-

[02:37:35] Speaker 8: 19.

[02:37:36] Speaker 1: Mm-hmm. Good enough. Um, it's a, basically it's a plus one potency mace, is what it counts as. But it's a fine branch that's, um, you know, uh, basically enchanted. Uh, it's doesn't look like anything that humans made, but you can usually swing it as a, um, +1 mace. Um, but if you want to, you can take off the root and attach it to a weapon. And you think when you do, the weapon would have a, would start having this very woody, leafy, um, feel to it as it starts to grow.

[02:38:05] Speaker 22: Start growing.

[02:38:06] Speaker 1: Yep. So, that's what that is. Um-

[02:38:11] Speaker 22: Sanity?

[02:38:12] Speaker 1: And then, uh, she talks a little bit more and, uh-

[02:38:15] Speaker 8: Kotal, should, as he's studying it and discovering what it is, like has a sense of reverence. (laughs) The power of nature.

[02:38:24] Speaker 1: And she hands you guys, um... (clears throat)

[02:38:27] Speaker 8: Would you, my friends, would you mind if I, uh, cared for this weapon?

[02:38:33] Speaker 23: It's all yours, my friend.

[02:38:35] Speaker 21: Yeah, okay.

[02:38:37] Speaker 23: I prefer larger weapons. (laughs)

[02:38:44] Speaker 1: And hands you guys two of these.

[02:38:46] Speaker 22: What are these?

[02:38:48] Speaker 8: Gems.

[02:38:48] Speaker 1: Small sapphires. Which is actually the one thing we were going to do tonight but I forgot to do and that is handle coins. If you guys can look at how much gold you have in your characters real quick.

[02:38:57] Speaker 22: Just gonna grab the 2020 pouches.

[02:39:01] Speaker 8: I think I have like... Yeah, I have four gold.

[02:39:04] Speaker 23: Yeah, I don't have a lot.

[02:39:05] Speaker 8: Yeah, you had time at the end of last session.

[02:39:07] Speaker 23: I spent some in town.

[02:39:08] Speaker 21: Oh.

[02:39:08] Speaker 23: I got a healer's kit.

[02:39:10] Speaker 21: Okay. I have eight gold and some silver.

[02:39:12] Speaker 23: And a gray axe because I wanted to vary attack types in case I needed it too. (coins jingling)

[02:39:24] Speaker 8: We need like a treasure chest we can use to hold the party gems.

[02:39:29] Speaker 22: So, do we know what these do?

[02:39:31] Speaker 8: Good job. There.

[02:39:33] Speaker 22: There it goes, things like gems.

[02:39:34] Speaker 1: They're not gems but they have... They'll work in the book but, um, gems, well, the way they work is you have to bargain with them a little bit. And depending on how well your diplomacy roll goes or your chance to try to bargain with them can impact what you get for price. (coughs) So pick a bag.

[02:39:50] Speaker 8: Kotal likes red always.

[02:39:52] Speaker 1: Actually, I'm going to go to the bathroom now.

[02:39:53] Speaker 8: Irv likes red. Kotal will accept red. Go Badgers.

[02:39:59] Speaker 22: Badgers? What are these badgers you speak of?

[02:40:02] Speaker 8: They are a fierce band of, of warriors.

[02:40:06] Speaker 21: They have badgers too.

[02:40:09] Speaker 22: The badgers have badges?

[02:40:10] Speaker 21: They do.

[02:40:12] Speaker 22: I don't think they had badgers on my island.

[02:40:13] Speaker 8: Wait, can we get badges?

[02:40:14] Speaker 21: It sounds... (laughs) I can make us badges.

[02:40:19] Speaker 8: (laughs) What color you want?

[02:40:23] Speaker 21: Uh, what are the choices? Uh, I'll just take blue.

[02:40:27] Speaker 22: Give me the light blue one.

[02:40:28] Speaker 8: Whoo, missed.

[02:40:29] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[02:40:30] Speaker 8: Ooh, it's soft. You picked the soft one.

[02:40:32] Speaker 21: Ooh, I like that.

[02:40:33] Speaker 8: It's gonna help... We're doing campaign points, so.

[02:40:35] Speaker 21: Yeah.

[02:40:35] Speaker 8: This is for Jomani. And we can use... We should use the-

[02:40:42] Speaker 23: Party loot?

[02:40:44] Speaker 8: That one's kind of weird.

[02:40:45] Speaker 22: What about the big green one?

[02:40:46] Speaker 8: You want the big green one for party loot?

[02:40:49] Speaker 23: It's going to have the most of everything, money and gems.

[02:40:57] Speaker 8: We're gonna forget they're in there, they're so tiny. (laughs)

[02:41:01] Speaker 23: (laughs) Oh, we totally are. Hey, you better put that in the party loot notes.

[02:41:06] Speaker 8: Oh, who's taking party loot notes?

[02:41:08] Speaker 23: You are. Oh, you actually have the keyboard.

[02:41:11] Speaker 8: Oh.

[02:41:12] Speaker 1: Well, you're gonna have to do party loot because-

[02:41:14] Speaker 8: I know, but we're trying... Well, we're coming like we're going to totally forget there's two tiny gems in here until somebody writes it down-

[02:41:19] Speaker 23: (laughs)

[02:41:19] Speaker 8: ... because they're so small and it's a giant bag.

[02:41:21] Speaker 1: Yeah. So how much gold does your guy have? And if you have silver, from here and up we're going to round up to one gold. If it's a consumable item, find multiples of it until you get one gold.

[02:41:30] Speaker 8: 14.

[02:41:31] Speaker 1: 14?

[02:41:32] Speaker 8: Round it up. 13 and a half. Yeah, 14.

[02:41:40] Speaker 23: I would like to trade my hero points in for platinum.

[02:41:43] Speaker 1: There you go. How much?

[02:41:45] Speaker 23: (laughs) I got two if I round it up.

[02:41:48] Speaker 1: You got the two. Okay. So basically, officially, whatever you have in your front pouch is what you have.

[02:41:55] Speaker 23: Five.

[02:41:55] Speaker 1: Um, that's an easy one. But who knows, if you guys are lucky, you can eventually someday earn the 10,000 coin.

[02:42:08] Speaker 8: Yeah.

[02:42:08] Speaker 1: I got to have it organized.

[02:42:09] Speaker 8: Can I bring my campaign coins from home and add them to my pouch?

[02:42:11] Speaker 21: (laughs) No, 'cause then you'll bring them from home and it'll be 5,000.

[02:42:15] Speaker 23: I have hundreds of gold. (laughs)

[02:42:18] Speaker 1: I wanna get more but the company's in Australia.

[02:42:20] Speaker 8: I know. The shipping is brutal. Every time they get some, you better buy a lot because of the shipping.

[02:42:24] Speaker 1: Every time they're out too. Which is why I have to go to Gen Con this year. I was gonna see if they're there.

[02:42:28] Speaker 8: Oh, yeah. Let me know. I, if they're there, I can bring stuff back for you. I'm switching this to party loot. The black one is party loot. But-

[02:42:35] Speaker 1: But party loot... Well, you can put them there if you want to. Um, party loot is going to be held by-

[02:42:39] Speaker 23: The treasurer, whoever that is.

[02:42:40] Speaker 8: Well, whoever, until of she's here.

[02:42:41] Speaker 23: Until Little Fairy, yeah.

[02:42:45] Speaker 1: Wow. So is that just the small gems?

[02:42:47] Speaker 8: That's the two gems.

[02:42:47] Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

[02:42:49] Speaker 8: Um, yeah, unless somebody wants to put them in their pockets.

[02:42:52] Speaker 1: If you want to, put them in this.

[02:42:54] Speaker 21: Why don't you stuff that in another one of our pouches?

[02:42:55] Speaker 1: Put them in this and then put this in your pouch.

[02:42:57] Speaker 21: Yeah.

[02:42:57] Speaker 1: And that way, it's over there. I might, I might have some little plastic baggies around here somewhere too. We can use them next time.

[02:43:02] Speaker 8: I have a zillion plastic bags-

[02:43:05] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[02:43:05] Speaker 8: ... from board game stuff so I can bring in some little transparent ones so that we can see what's in them.

[02:43:09] Speaker 1: Oh, yeah. Yeah, I know I have some little tiny ones around here. If you guys want, if they're bigger or thicker, you guys wanna use those instead.

[02:43:15] Speaker 8: All right, I'll bring... I have so many from, like, board game obsession years that I'll just bring them in and you can pick what you like.

[02:43:21] Speaker 1: Um, so the Little Fey are, um-You think where, you rest up, um, (instrumental music) the, uh, willow dry it, uh, is, is super happy. She heals up you guys and, uh, brings up some nice fruits, berries, nuts and whatnot that you guys can eat for dinner. Um-

[02:43:41] Speaker 24: Mm-hmm, fudge!

[02:43:41] Speaker 1: ... if you're, you know, if you want to all that much. Um, before, um, helping you out, the two, the, the little fairies offer you guys... They know where you can get some treasure and they'd be happy to take you there. Um-

[02:43:56] Speaker 24: Treasure?

[02:43:57] Speaker 1: So you start heading back. Um, they take you to, um... Eventually you pass by, um, Ailish is where they're from. Um, she says, "If you guys ever need anything, feel free to see her over here." And you can tell the bridge isn't far away. You know you could get here without any danger. Um-

[02:44:14] Speaker 25: Probably-

[02:44:14] Speaker 26: Who is saying this?

[02:44:15] Speaker 1: Ailish.

[02:44:15] Speaker 25: Any elf?

[02:44:16] Speaker 27: Okay.

[02:44:17] Speaker 1: Yeah. She basically hands you a few acorns and she says, "Keep this in your pouch. They'll help protect you to get over here." So basically that's just way of your knowing if you're going basically this world, if you wander anywhere away from, from the crossing, you're probably dead. But this will protect you to her, you know-

[02:44:35] Speaker 27: Okay.

[02:44:35] Speaker 1: ... her place and back 'cause she's a... Otherwise you'd never be able to interact with one of the, um, main NPCs. Um-

[02:44:41] Speaker 27: It was a pleasure meeting you, Ailish.

[02:44:44] Speaker 1: Um, she says, "Yes, as well." Um, oh... I can't remember the other-

[02:44:50] Speaker 26: (sneezes)

[02:44:50] Speaker 27: Bless you.

[02:44:50] Speaker 1: Um, anyway, um-

[02:44:51] Speaker 27: (sneezes). Bless you.

[02:44:52] Speaker 1: She nods politely and, um, "Wishes you guys would come visit some more. She may have need of some assistance, um-"

[02:45:00] Speaker 27: Yes, I'm, well I'm wanting to see this strawberry patch.

[02:45:03] Speaker 1: She, um, Grim, Grimgar, I might say Grimgar a lot, um, says, "Well, you guys have shown yourself quite, uh, strong in battle. Um, well, perhaps, um, you'd be welcome to come visit me as well." He points to a part on the lake, um, not too far away from-

[02:45:24] Speaker 27: The one with the house?

[02:45:26] Speaker 1: ... the island. Um-

[02:45:28] Speaker 27: The island with the house or a different one?

[02:45:29] Speaker 1: What's that?

[02:45:30] Speaker 27: Island with the house or are you thinking on the shore?

[02:45:32] Speaker 1: He's kind of just off of the shore.

[02:45:34] Speaker 27: Okay.

[02:45:34] Speaker 1: He's in that way. He has a little thing he built where he should be safe. Um, he says, "Just be careful. I, uh, to grow my, um... I am interested in growing, uh, honey for mead, um, and selling that. Um, as the caravans go there's plenty of plants and plenty to pollinate. So I've been keeping bees, so I've been busy tending that, but, uh, feel free. Um, I should perhaps like to see you again sometime. And I may also have need of you." Um, so the fae, wanting to reward you guys, um, take you to this place where there's this nice little round patch on the ground and there's plenty of gooey bits. Um-

[02:46:17] Speaker 26: Is this the lost gnome hoard?

[02:46:18] Speaker 1: (coughs) You, mm, definitely recognize this spot. Um, because yeah, this is where the, uh, they brought the other stone statues to life for a few seconds.

[02:46:30] Speaker 26: Mm.

[02:46:30] Speaker 1: Um, and if they see treasure and they point and there are their backpacks which, um-

[02:46:36] Speaker 26: (laughs) Oh.

[02:46:36] Speaker 1: ... managed to survive. Um, uh, you guys start going through their backpacks. Um, and there is a ax.

[02:46:45] Speaker 26: Thank you, little ones.

[02:46:46] Speaker 27: That's Frank's.

[02:46:49] Speaker 1: Where did I put that? Too much crap.

[02:46:53] Speaker 27: Is it a great ax or just a regular old meat ax?

[02:46:57] Speaker 1: Battle ax. It is a one-handed one. Now it has a... Well, you wanna do crafting?

[02:47:03] Speaker 27: It's got runes it doesn't matter what it is.

[02:47:05] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[02:47:09] Speaker 25: Uh, 13.

[02:47:12] Speaker 1: We're gonna say that's high enough so I don't have to... I can't remember the DCs off the top of my head.

[02:47:16] Speaker 25: It's 15 usually.

[02:47:17] Speaker 1: Oh. I'm gonna... You can figure it out. This is, it has a plus one potency rune since... Yeah. So-

[02:47:25] Speaker 25: Another plus one rating.

[02:47:26] Speaker 1: Excuse me.

[02:47:27] Speaker 27: We can exchange it.

[02:47:29] Speaker 25: I can, I can transfer it with my crafting.

[02:47:31] Speaker 27: Oh, that would be very handy.

[02:47:32] Speaker 25: It might take some time. We'll need to do it in town.

[02:47:34] Speaker 27: Okay.

[02:47:35] Speaker 1: If you guys want to rest for this, you're resting overnight, we say over the night you guys can do it so you don't have to hold onto the cards. You can just go ahead and add that here.

[02:47:42] Speaker 27: Checking that into my model then.

[02:47:44] Speaker 1: (coughs) Yeah.

[02:47:44] Speaker 27: Cool.

[02:47:44] Speaker 1: We'll say you're gonna do it overnight, zero out the anger anyways. It'll be the next day before you do, do it again. Um, there is a ring in the, uh... Well, no, it's actually not a ring in there. Um, the fae also... Well, you dig through the, the pouch and you look through everything.

[02:48:01] Speaker 24: My friend-

[02:48:02] Speaker 1: ... and-

[02:48:02] Speaker 24: Do you want to roll for the potency rune?

[02:48:05] Speaker 26: No, you can use it better than I.

[02:48:07] Speaker 24: Thank you, Michael.

[02:48:08] Speaker 25: Mm-hmm.

[02:48:10] Speaker 24: There's a ring.

[02:48:11] Speaker 26: Sorry.

[02:48:12] Speaker 27: Dells provides.

[02:48:14] Speaker 1: Okay, let me see real quick.

[02:48:17] Speaker 27: Just loot my friends. My companions. Take all their gear. (coins jingling) I'm fine. (laughs)

[02:48:25] Speaker 24: Did you know these people?

[02:48:26] Speaker 27: Yes. (laughs)

[02:48:29] Speaker 24: This... Huh. My friend, this must be quite tough for you.

[02:48:35] Speaker 27: They're a bunch of bastards. (laughs)

[02:48:36] Speaker 1: So there is some gold in their pouches as well. You guys can divide that up. About 10 altogether. I can subdivide that up actually.

[02:48:45] Speaker 25: I do have to remember the ring, the things. This is, uh-

[02:48:48] Speaker 1: They all look a little different.

[02:48:50] Speaker 26: The cross is five.

[02:48:50] Speaker 25: Cross is five.

[02:48:51] Speaker 26: This is one.

[02:48:52] Speaker 1: You have to look for the thing on 'em because there's two different types of gold in there, but they all have numbers on them.

[02:48:56] Speaker 25: That one doesn't have a number. Square.

[02:48:58] Speaker 26: Yeah, this one doesn't have a number either. Oh, it's this.

[02:48:59] Speaker 1: They do, but it's really small in one of the corner, one of the top sides. Let me see, otherwise I can't tell.

[02:49:06] Speaker 27: That's supposed to be a one there too.

[02:49:07] Speaker 28: Uh, try the other side.

[02:49:10] Speaker 26: One?

[02:49:10] Speaker 27: Yeah.

[02:49:11] Speaker 28: Oh, one, yeah. Okay.

[02:49:13] Speaker 1: The square ones are always easy.

[02:49:14] Speaker 25: Which one is it supposed to be?

[02:49:15] Speaker 27: One.

[02:49:15] Speaker 28: One.

[02:49:16] Speaker 25: That's eight gold. That's a one.

[02:49:19] Speaker 28: Should be a five.

[02:49:20] Speaker 24: Um-

[02:49:20] Speaker 25: These are supposed to be twos?

[02:49:24] Speaker 1: I thought they were. They must have got fell in the wrong...

[02:49:26] Speaker 26: How about we make it an even nine?

[02:49:28] Speaker 1: Yeah, we can do that. (laughs)

[02:49:30] Speaker 29: Yeah.

[02:49:30] Speaker 1: So I'll just give you guys each three, so-

[02:49:32] Speaker 3: Or, uh, I guess if you go 10-

[02:49:33] Speaker 29: Same.

[02:49:33] Speaker 3: ... then one for the party then. I don't know.

[02:49:35] Speaker 1: Here we go. Two, two, and this is also a two. I'll take the five. And I'll throw a single one.

[02:49:46] Speaker 8: Five's gone.

[02:49:46] Speaker 1: I'm gonna grab me a pouch for party loot. Actually, we'll do this one.

[02:49:49] Speaker 8: This is the, here's the party loot's in here. You told me to put the...

[02:49:52] Speaker 1: (clears throat) Well, no, that's whoever wants to hold onto it. Or, oh, you want to do that? Here.

[02:49:55] Speaker 8: Yeah.

[02:49:55] Speaker 1: So I'll just have that.

[02:49:56] Speaker 8: That's got the gems in it.

[02:49:57] Speaker 1: I'll keep that with, uh... Yeah, that's a good color 'cause that matches Vidia-

[02:50:01] Speaker 8: Yeah.

[02:50:02] Speaker 1: ... who is also mostly purple. And when we finish up you can just put the pouches over on the... yeah, right over there. Um-

[02:50:11] Speaker 3: You said we also got a ring of something?

[02:50:13] Speaker 1: Well-

[02:50:13] Speaker 8: He changed his mind. It was mine instead.

[02:50:15] Speaker 3: Oh.

[02:50:15] Speaker 1: No, 'cause one of the fey comes up and she was really happy, um, Silvermist. And says, "Noble friends, you have, um, done well defeating the spiders. And you have proven, uh, your good intentions through the tests. We would present you with this." And she holds up, in this case it's the size of her head, but it's a ring.

[02:50:36] Speaker 3: Hmm.

[02:50:37] Speaker 1: Once again, you can...

[02:50:40] Speaker 3: Ooh, that's a good roll.

[02:50:42] Speaker 8: 22.

[02:50:43] Speaker 3: That's like a critical roll, so that's like-

[02:50:45] Speaker 8: It is a-

[02:50:45] Speaker 3: ... double the value of the ring. It's like two rings.

[02:50:50] Speaker 1: Reading ring.

[02:50:54] Speaker 3: What's that do?

[02:50:55] Speaker 1: It's weird. (laughs) It basically lets you read in dim light.

[02:50:59] Speaker 8: Oh.

[02:50:59] Speaker 3: Is that like a real item?

[02:51:00] Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

[02:51:01] Speaker 3: I didn't know if it was like a custom item.

[02:51:04] Speaker 1: As much as I can find weird stuff, you guys will probably be fine today.

[02:51:10] Speaker 3: I'm okay with that. Other, it's a lot of the like loot is kinda boring.

[02:51:13] Speaker 1: I mean, I figured I could give a few potent spoons here and there but-

[02:51:16] Speaker 3: Yeah.

[02:51:16] Speaker 1: ... I'll start looking at some of the other weird ones, uh, once you guys are a little bit better set.

[02:51:20] Speaker 3: I don't think it, I don't think Pathfinder second edition has many of them.

[02:51:23] Speaker 8: There's a ring that helps you read at night. It's supposed to be for people who have vision problems, but whatever.

[02:51:31] Speaker 29: Is it worth 7,000 gold by chance? 15?

[02:51:35] Speaker 8: Uh, it is... The greater reading ring is worth 1,800 gold.

[02:51:39] Speaker 29: Hmm.

[02:51:40] Speaker 8: So, so that is a level 12 item and this is probably the level one version.

[02:51:43] Speaker 29: Probably.

[02:51:44] Speaker 3: 15. (laughs)

[02:51:45] Speaker 8: Which is worth 15.

[02:51:46] Speaker 3: (laughs)

[02:51:47] Speaker 8: (laughs)

[02:51:47] Speaker 3: There's a little difference.

[02:51:48] Speaker 8: But also, I'm not sure why anybody would buy this given the description.

[02:51:52] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[02:51:52] Speaker 8: It's kind of sp- designed so once it's been bonded to somebody it can never be used by anybody else.

[02:51:58] Speaker 3: Oh. Yeah. Does it let you read like different languages?

[02:52:03] Speaker 1: Now one thing I'll also let you guys do, since this is mostly a trading bartering place, um, typical selling is half gold but there is a chance you can try to barter with it, where you can get... If you're exchanging for something else you might get a better chunk of its value, more than what we paid.

[02:52:18] Speaker 3: That might be worth something to try to, to sell.

[02:52:20] Speaker 8: All right. Well, I can... (dice rolling)

[02:52:26] Speaker 1: Why don't they take you guys back? Um-

[02:52:28] Speaker 8: I'll create a document for non-gold party loot tracking.

[02:52:33] Speaker 1: Yeah. Well eventually that's also gonna-

[02:52:35] Speaker 8: Maybe we get cards.

[02:52:35] Speaker 1: Basically I'll have the card for her and it'll go in her card if you guys don't assign it to someone. Um, just remember you have it for now. By next week if you're able to bring those back then it'll... 'Cause I didn't have any rings surprisingly.

[02:52:46] Speaker 8: We found a reading ring.

[02:52:48] Speaker 30: Yep.

[02:52:48] Speaker 1: (laughs) So.

[02:52:51] Speaker 8: It'll be in the list.

[02:52:52] Speaker 30: Yeah.

[02:52:54] Speaker 8: We're going to put it in party loot.

[02:52:58] Speaker 1: Yeah. She'll be your party loot holder.

[02:52:59] Speaker 8: And she can... And you're gonna have item cards.

[02:53:02] Speaker 30: Yeah.

[02:53:02] Speaker 1: And so basically if you, and if no one's claimed it, it'll be on her. And then once someone claims it you just add it to your thing and then the card goes back, so...

[02:53:09] Speaker 8: Okay.

[02:53:11] Speaker 3: Um-

[02:53:11] Speaker 30: I definitely have a few cards.

[02:53:13] Speaker 8: Do you want to, are we gonna use item cards for consumables?

[02:53:16] Speaker 1: Uh, no, that one's... Um, initially yes. She'll hold it if no one claims it. If someone claims it then...

[02:53:22] Speaker 8: Just for your laboratory inventories or anything that we have ourselves?

[02:53:25] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[02:53:25] Speaker 8: Okay. Okay.

[02:53:28] Speaker 1: I didn't, I... With my select, I don't know, I think I have some potions but I couldn't find it.

[02:53:31] Speaker 8: Yeah. It's-

[02:53:32] Speaker 1: Ken has a ton. Ken's section's far larger than mine.

[02:53:35] Speaker 3: The cards?

[02:53:36] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[02:53:36] Speaker 3: Yeah, I bought a lot of those things.

[02:53:39] Speaker 1: But yeah, that's it for now. You guys head back home. Um, it's not... If you take the direct path and not wind through the forest like you guys did earlier-

[02:53:46] Speaker 8: It's like three minutes.

[02:53:47] Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not so bad, so-

[02:53:48] Speaker 8: We walk for two and a half minutes and come out into the open and see the bridge.

[02:53:52] Speaker 3: Well, that doesn't take long.

[02:53:54] Speaker 1: And yeah, if you're able to, uh, come in, you're able to... It's late by, night by this point, so you hop in, basically in bed again. Uh, wake up in the morning just to find there's perhaps another adventure afoot.

[02:54:04] Speaker 3: Before they leave, the, uh, fairies leave, I wanted to question them about the, uh, the gnomish, uh, uh, the great gnomish treasure hoard that's missing out here that was stolen from the IRS.

[02:54:18] Speaker 8: I mean, we can talk about it next time.

[02:54:20] Speaker 1: General room service.

[02:54:20] Speaker 8: I do, I do want to at some point in a moment of quiet have a conversation with the captain.

[02:54:24] Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

[02:54:25] Speaker 8: But we'll, we can wait till everybody's here.

[02:54:29] Speaker 1: Yeah. Yeah, so it'll be next week, um, next week is the last session in the introductory part, so generally I don't stay this long at Level 1. But I wanted to at least get through all the introductions, so you guys will meet the remainder of the, uh, uh, Drimasticae next week and-

[02:54:42] Speaker 3: Who did I miss last week?

[02:54:44] Speaker 1: Oh, the two on the board there, Lynn and Sylvia.

[02:54:47] Speaker 8: Lynn and Syl- Lynn is an old monkish man. We don't actually know much about him other than he's an old man who acts like a monk.

[02:54:55] Speaker 29: Mm-hmm.

[02:54:55] Speaker 8: Um, and Sylvia was...

[02:54:59] Speaker 30: She was, um...

[02:55:00] Speaker 8: Oh yeah, I remember what her stats were.

[02:55:01] Speaker 30: She gave me Alden vibe, but I don't know.

[02:55:03] Speaker 8: Yeah. Um, but I mean, I don't remember what she, she did. She healed us a couple times.

[02:55:07] Speaker 1: So-

[02:55:07] Speaker 8: Or maybe she just used medicine to stabilize it. She's the one who kept bringing us back.

[02:55:11] Speaker 1: Oh, that would've been him.

[02:55:12] Speaker 8: Oh, that's him? Okay.

[02:55:13] Speaker 3: That was Lynn.

[02:55:14] Speaker 1: She would be classified as, closest thing to think of is a, um, who is it? The one who uses panache? Um...

[02:55:22] Speaker 3: Swashbuckler.

[02:55:22] Speaker 1: Swashbuckler. That's the closest thing she would be. Now your character might know something, the name Mornhuld wouldn't actually mean something to you. Um, uh, in your case, like I'll send you a note to me. That, that way you can introduce her to the party too if you feel like it, so...

[02:55:41] Speaker 8: These are empty.

[02:55:42] Speaker 1: But it would, might mean something to you.

[02:55:44] Speaker 8: Where do you want us to keep the not empty ones? Um, you can just put 'em on top of the printer or something like that. I'll try to get a little-

[02:55:49] Speaker 3: Should we put our name in them so we know which is what?

[02:55:51] Speaker 8: My name is, mine is red.

[02:55:53] Speaker 3: We can color code it.

[02:55:54] Speaker 29: Yeah.

[02:55:55] Speaker 1: Just remember what color you have.

[02:55:57] Speaker 3: I have one with the most money in it.

[02:56:00] Speaker 29: I am chatbot.

[02:56:02] Speaker 3: Chatbot, I have the most money in my pouch, whatever color it is. (laughs)

[02:56:07] Speaker 1: And that's like-

[02:56:08] Speaker 3: I like blue. And I'll be missing next week.

[02:56:10] Speaker 8: All right, I'm stopping-

[02:56:11] Speaker 3: Oh, yeah, sorry. You're the one who couldn't-
