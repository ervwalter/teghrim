DURATION:1309.913
[02:59:58] Speaker 1: Looks to me...

[03:00:00] Speaker 2: Okay, yeah, that would be Stripes.

[03:00:02] Speaker 1: Oh. Uh, Jesus. 26.

[03:00:09] Speaker 2: That'll hit. As a matter of fact, that's going to crit.

[03:00:14] Speaker 1: Oh, yay. (dice clattering) Uh, 17 sonic damage.

[03:00:27] Speaker 2: That is a really... He's still up now. The others have more hit points because of the spider but, yeah, he and the spider are oozing a lot of different colored oozes.

[03:00:37] Speaker 1: Well, let's see if I can, uh, help with that. Um, I would like the spider rider that I just hit and the squig there, um... Actually, no, I'll target the squig guy over here.

[03:00:50] Speaker 2: Thank you. (laughs)

[03:00:50] Speaker 1: Uh, so you have something to continue trying to hit. (laughs) Um, with electric arc.

[03:00:55] Speaker 2: Okay.

[03:00:55] Speaker 1: They need to make a DC15 reflex save.

[03:01:00] Speaker 3: 28.

[03:01:01] Speaker 1: Nah, not anymore.

[03:01:02] Speaker 2: (laughs) Yeah.

[03:01:03] Speaker 3: Oh, the olden days.

[03:01:04] Speaker 1: Or, uh, the other-

[03:01:05] Speaker 2: So the one you just hit saved but not crit, so I think he takes half damage.

[03:01:08] Speaker 1: He'll take half damage.

[03:01:09] Speaker 2: The squig on the other side is probably going to fail. Let me see what exactly happened. That was will?

[03:01:16] Speaker 1: Uh, reflex.

[03:01:17] Speaker 2: Oh, reflex. Um, that'd be, uh... When you said a 15?

[03:01:21] Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

[03:01:21] Speaker 2: That would be a barely fail. He almost crit failed.

[03:01:26] Speaker 1: Okay.

[03:01:27] Speaker 2: And where's everyone at for coins?

[03:01:29] Speaker 1: Uh, this one-

[03:01:29] Speaker 3: I have one.

[03:01:30] Speaker 4: Me and Katie.

[03:01:31] Speaker 2: Okay, go ahead and throw a lot.

[03:01:34] Speaker 4: 10.

[03:01:34] Speaker 5: Nine. (laughs)

[03:01:36] Speaker 2: (laughs)

[03:01:37] Speaker 1: (laughs) You keep rolling one above everybody. (laughs)

[03:01:39] Speaker 4: I feel bad 'cause you're going down. (laughs)

[03:01:42] Speaker 1: All right. Um, so the one that passed will take half damage, the other will take full.

[03:01:47] Speaker 4: Can I choose to give mine to Katie just so she doesn't die? (laughs)

[03:01:52] Speaker 2: I don't think you can pass them, that I know of.

[03:01:54] Speaker 4: Damn. All right, I tried.

[03:01:55] Speaker 1: Six. It is-

[03:01:56] Speaker 4: We got MPCs, some of us.

[03:01:57] Speaker 5: He's, he's full.

[03:01:58] Speaker 2: So three.

[03:01:58] Speaker 5: Pops are trying.

[03:01:59] Speaker 2: Well, guess what you needed to kill the spider rider?

[03:02:02] Speaker 4: Yay.

[03:02:03] Speaker 2: (laughs)

[03:02:03] Speaker 4: It was one... The both MPCs are in there with you and one of them stabilized last time, so maybe one of them will stabilize you this time. Hopefully.

[03:02:11] Speaker 2: Um, and then the other one took six, so red won.

[03:02:16] Speaker 4: Electric arc is badass at level one. (laughs)

[03:02:19] Speaker 2: Yeah.

[03:02:21] Speaker 4: Take six. Two targets with a decent amount of damage.

[03:02:24] Speaker 2: Yeah.

[03:02:25] Speaker 5: That's why I took it when I saw it. I was like, "That's bad."

[03:02:28] Speaker 4: It loses its luster at level 10 but (laughs) level one it's still pretty awesome.

[03:02:33] Speaker 2: Hopeful. That's...

[03:02:33] Speaker 1: It's just nice having an extra imaging cap trip.

[03:02:35] Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, who's next?

[03:02:36] Speaker 1: I don't have a ton of options for that.

[03:02:37] Speaker 4: Squid, squid. Uh, squid red.

[03:02:39] Speaker 2: Or, oh, I'm sorry, which one?

[03:02:40] Speaker 4: The red.

[03:02:41] Speaker 2: Red? Oh, okay.

[03:02:42] Speaker 1: Especially since I'm-

[03:02:43] Speaker 4: There's only one, only one left.

[03:02:44] Speaker 2: No, there's two.

[03:02:45] Speaker 1: Yeah, there's one on this side.

[03:02:47] Speaker 2: Oh, well, there's also a red one.

[03:02:48] Speaker 4: There's only one red.

[03:02:48] Speaker 2: Yeah, gotcha. Um, he can only attack the MPCs. He's probably going to go for Lynn 'cause he'd been chomping on Lynn.

[03:02:54] Speaker 4: Red.

[03:02:55] Speaker 5: Red.

[03:02:56] Speaker 2: Let me see if that-

[03:02:56] Speaker 4: She's immune.

[03:02:57] Speaker 2: He misses.

[03:02:59] Speaker 4: Lynn, you better get him, uh, Lynn gotta get killed. She's an MPC. Yeah. Oh, yeah. And let me know when the inter... In, in the inner round happens. The end so I can-

[03:03:07] Speaker 5: The end of the round.

[03:03:08] Speaker 2: End of the round.

[03:03:08] Speaker 4: They're at the end of the round.

[03:03:09] Speaker 1: Have we passed-

[03:03:10] Speaker 4: MPCs are always last.

[03:03:11] Speaker 1: Well, the goblins did nothing. That would've been the end of the round.

[03:03:13] Speaker 2: Okay. So, um, basically those two will get an action. Lynn will turn around. He will, um, pull out from his pouch, um, a healing potion-

[03:03:23] Speaker 4: Oh, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.

[03:03:23] Speaker 2: ... and he'll put that down your throat.

[03:03:25] Speaker 4: Yay.

[03:03:25] Speaker 2: So healing does what? You guys remember? Top of your head. Is it D8?

[03:03:30] Speaker 1: I only know 5B.

[03:03:32] Speaker 2: Yeah.

[03:03:33] Speaker 4: It depends on the level.

[03:03:34] Speaker 1: This is the basic one.

[03:03:35] Speaker 2: This is the basic one.

[03:03:36] Speaker 4: Shitting on mine are 1D8.

[03:03:37] Speaker 1: It's gonna be your turn, by the way. You get two points back at least.

[03:03:40] Speaker 4: And you're conscious.

[03:03:41] Speaker 1: And you're conscious.

[03:03:42] Speaker 5: Two hit points, whoop.

[03:03:44] Speaker 1: Whoops.

[03:03:45] Speaker 4: Stay down on the ground. They can't hurt you if you're hiding below the wall of the...

[03:03:51] Speaker 5: Yeah.

[03:03:51] Speaker 4: You're laying... You, you would be laying on the ground of the cart. You dropped everything you were holding also.

[03:03:57] Speaker 5: Yeah.

[03:03:57] Speaker 4: So you don't have your weapon.

[03:03:58] Speaker 2: One thing is, you can shoot from the... While you're... As long as you can see him, you can shoot laying down and it's not a problem.

[03:04:03] Speaker 5: Yeah.

[03:04:04] Speaker 4: Couldn't she see through, like... Does the carts actually look like that or is that, like, little gaps you can shoot through?

[03:04:09] Speaker 2: I, uh, yeah, they're like that and you could... Yeah, I'd say you could shoot through it.

[03:04:10] Speaker 4: There's probably little gaps there anyway.

[03:04:12] Speaker 5: Pew.

[03:04:13] Speaker 2: You guys are on, standing on top of actual, kind of... There is some luggage and stuff in there.

[03:04:18] Speaker 4: Oh, okay.

[03:04:18] Speaker 2: But there's enough that if you were laying down, you could try to shoot through it, I'll give you that.

[03:04:22] Speaker 5: Mm, mm.

[03:04:24] Speaker 2: Um, so at the end of the round, also the wagons move a little bit more 'cause the squigs have to keep up with you guys.

[03:04:29] Speaker 4: (sighs)

[03:04:31] Speaker 2: So you're moved to kind of like that now.

[03:04:33] Speaker 4: We wanted to be parallel.

[03:04:36] Speaker 2: And then so then who went after that?

[03:04:38] Speaker 1: Um, so after red squig, which-

[03:04:41] Speaker 2: Red squig went... Okay.

[03:04:42] Speaker 1: I don't-

[03:04:42] Speaker 4: He just went.

[03:04:43] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[03:04:44] Speaker 2: Um, he would've-

[03:04:44] Speaker 1: It's just so confusing.

[03:04:44] Speaker 2: He would've bounced.

[03:04:45] Speaker 4: He already did. He attacked Lynn and missed twice.

[03:04:47] Speaker 2: So we'll say he had to bounce up to him. They moved, then he bounced up and he missed Lynn.

[03:04:51] Speaker 1: Oh, both blue squigs are up? Damn.

[03:04:54] Speaker 2: Oh, blue's next?

[03:04:55] Speaker 1: No.

[03:04:55] Speaker 4: No.

[03:04:56] Speaker 1: I'm just surprised both blue squigs are up. I didn't see the other one.

[03:04:58] Speaker 2: Blue hasn't taken... I think one of the blues took.

[03:05:00] Speaker 4: He attacks two.

[03:05:01] Speaker 1: Aurelia is up next.

[03:05:04] Speaker 2: So you did fall and when you became unconscious, you did drop your, whatever weapon you were holding.

[03:05:07] Speaker 4: You don't have anything in your hand so you-

[03:05:08] Speaker 5: Do I see number one from where Lane?

[03:05:12] Speaker 2: Mm, I'd say him, no. If you're... He could easily see off the back and the sides, but...

[03:05:18] Speaker 5: Not number one?

[03:05:19] Speaker 4: Number one is off the back. She means blue one.

[03:05:21] Speaker 5: Oh.

[03:05:22] Speaker 2: The blue one, yeah.

[03:05:22] Speaker 5: Yeah.

[03:05:22] Speaker 4: She can't see that blue, red one exists.

[03:05:24] Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, you can see that... Yeah, you can definitely see. You have a clear shot on him.

[03:05:27] Speaker 5: Uh, if we're laying down, I'm gonna pick up my hand crossbow and I'm gonna shoot number one.

[03:05:32] Speaker 2: Yep, let's...

[03:05:34] Speaker 1: Goblin riders are on deck. Or rider. (laughs)

[03:05:39] Speaker 5: (laughs)

[03:05:43] Speaker 4: Credit where it's due.

[03:05:45] Speaker 5: 12.

[03:05:46] Speaker 2: Uh, 12 will miss because extra-

[03:05:49] Speaker 1: Combining biting bugs and electric arc-

[03:05:50] Speaker 2: It was a pricey range.

[03:05:51] Speaker 1: ... is great because-

[03:05:51] Speaker 2: High CC.

[03:05:52] Speaker 5: Okay, uh...

[03:05:52] Speaker 1: Multi-attack penalty doesn't apply.

[03:05:54] Speaker 5: Oh, I suppose it was an action to pick up my crossbow when I can.

[03:05:56] Speaker 1: I can get two spell attacks in.

[03:05:57] Speaker 2: One's a load, one to shoot if you want to reload.

[03:05:59] Speaker 5: Yeah, reload.

[03:06:00] Speaker 1: Which is normally quite hard to do for a-

[03:06:02] Speaker 5: Yep.

[03:06:03] Speaker 2: Um, so next up-

[03:06:04] Speaker 6: Because of action comedy.

[03:06:05] Speaker 7: Goes after me.

[03:06:06] Speaker 8: Goblin rider.

[03:06:07] Speaker 2: Goblin rider. Um, he has at least three targets he can go after. But probably not, uh, really 'cause you're on the ground. He's shooting, but he's more focused on the two that aren't, so even, odd. Even, so he's going after you. (dramatic music)

[03:06:25] Speaker 9: Yes.

[03:06:25] Speaker 2: It'll take him one action to get to there. Right up next to you, um, and then he'd have two attacks on you, uh, which takes with his little thing. That's gonna be a 24 to hit. No, minus one.

[03:06:37] Speaker 8: 23 still hits.

[03:06:38] Speaker 2: Yeah. For a whopping one point of damage.

[03:06:41] Speaker 8: Mother-fucker.

[03:06:44] Speaker 7: Only one point?

[03:06:45] Speaker 2: Well... Yeah, these have no plus to them.

[03:06:48] Speaker 8: So rude.

[03:06:48] Speaker 2: Um, so he's gonna take a second attack. They have crossbows, but they're not very accurate. You guys are moving, you're hard to hit, so, um.

[03:06:55] Speaker 8: Jesus, that's max damage.

[03:06:56] Speaker 2: That's gonna miss. Yeah, I get the... I- I've been getting the max damage on the misses.

[03:06:59] Speaker 8: I didn't see the 20/20, I just saw the-

[03:07:01] Speaker 2: And a little damage on the hit.

[03:07:02] Speaker 8: ... max damage die. (laughs)

[03:07:03] Speaker 2: Um, that would be a 16.

[03:07:04] Speaker 8: For level one.

[03:07:05] Speaker 2: 15 since he was riding.

[03:07:06] Speaker 8: Six out of D6 hurts.

[03:07:10] Speaker 2: That's it for him.

[03:07:11] Speaker 8: All right. I wanna change it. Uh, I said Bessie's name in my header, I want that to be Viernea and, um, I'm gonna make a check.

[03:07:19] Speaker 7: Your hammer's name Bessie?

[03:07:21] Speaker 8: No, it's now Viernea 'cause I'm retconning it.

[03:07:23] Speaker 7: Okay.

[03:07:26] Speaker 8: Uh, okay. That is very high. That is a 24.

[03:07:30] Speaker 2: That'll hit.

[03:07:31] Speaker 8: Okay. Um, so that is 11 bludgeoning and 3 spirit.

[03:07:37] Speaker 2: So, 14 all together?

[03:07:39] Speaker 8: Mm-hmm.

[03:07:40] Speaker 2: You take a great whop and they're both kinda wobbly now.

[03:07:44] Speaker 8: Mm, love it.

[03:07:45] Speaker 2: Uh, he was pretty good on.

[03:07:47] Speaker 8: Should have done this beforehand, but I will intimidate him, be like, "Oh, you don't want a piece of this, my friend."

[03:07:52] Speaker 2: (laughs) They appreciate the intimidation.

[03:07:56] Speaker 8: Um, that is only a 12.

[03:07:57] Speaker 2: Uh, that would... Well, see, that's Will.

[03:07:59] Speaker 8: Will DC, maybe he's got a plus two. (laughs)

[03:08:02] Speaker 2: (laughs) He has a plus three.

[03:08:04] Speaker 8: All right, second attack.

[03:08:06] Speaker 2: I mean, you would have needed a plus one.

[03:08:07] Speaker 8: Nat 20.

[03:08:08] Speaker 2: Oh, oh boy.

[03:08:09] Speaker 8: On that... What is that? Attack?

[03:08:11] Speaker 2: Yeah, on the attack.

[03:08:12] Speaker 8: Nice. Well, now he's dead.

[03:08:13] Speaker 2: Yeah. (laughs)

[03:08:14] Speaker 8: Um, six-

[03:08:17] Speaker 2: Thanks.

[03:08:17] Speaker 8: ... uh, 22 bludgeoning and 6 spirit.

[03:08:20] Speaker 2: Okay, so basically you see him go splat. And as you guys drive away, you just see this, you know, splatted guy getting further and further away.

[03:08:28] Speaker 8: (laughs) And that is my turn. Um, next is blue.

[03:08:36] Speaker 2: Blue, they are gonna continue hopping up. Um, so this one's going after one of you two.

[03:08:41] Speaker 8: Kotal is on deck.

[03:08:43] Speaker 2: We're gonna do even, odd. Odd. Every one I roll randomly, it always goes after you. I'm gonna actually put it in between both of you guys there because you just-

[03:08:53] Speaker 8: Yeah, it's fine. Barbarian's meant to take damage.

[03:08:55] Speaker 2: I might even say it takes him two actions to get there, but he's gonna go there and take a chomp at you. Miss horribly on a ten, uh, it's like a 10 which equals a nine. Other guy, you're laying down, which makes you harder to hit. So I'm gonna say it's one of the other three. Gonna go after her.

[03:09:20] Speaker 9: (laughs)

[03:09:20] Speaker 2: He hops up to the front of the car.

[03:09:23] Speaker 9: I need to get some Mountain Dew on my way home. (laughs) I gotta stay awake for another seven hours. (laughs)

[03:09:28] Speaker 2: Oh.

[03:09:29] Speaker 9: I can take a nap. I'll probably will go home and take a 90-minute nap and then wake up.

[03:09:33] Speaker 7: He has to do another, like, night climb thing?

[03:09:36] Speaker 8: Yeah.

[03:09:37] Speaker 2: Probably sucks-

[03:09:38] Speaker 9: It's the second one is the last one.

[03:09:39] Speaker 2: All the way across town it's the-

[03:09:40] Speaker 9: There's a big party in two weeks-

[03:09:42] Speaker 2: Oh, is there?

[03:09:42] Speaker 9: ... because of it.

[03:09:42] Speaker 8: Oh yeah, no more chart sink. That's huge.

[03:09:45] Speaker 2: Um, he would miss her 'cause that's not... Um, next up.

[03:09:49] Speaker 10: Oh, sorry, um-

[03:09:52] Speaker 6: Flurry on the-

[03:09:52] Speaker 10: I think I said... Yeah.

[03:09:53] Speaker 6: ... blue two.

[03:09:53] Speaker 8: Kotal.

[03:09:55] Speaker 6: Uh, those are probably both end of the round.

[03:09:57] Speaker 8: The end of the rounds?

[03:09:58] Speaker 6: Unless the, the... No, their AC has to be better than that. Uh-

[03:10:02] Speaker 2: These things have a surprisingly... Well, you guys don't know they're called Squigs since no one's identified them yet, but, uh, second action is... Or third... Second action is just a, a wish and a prayer. Nope, uh, sorry, for the third.

[03:10:16] Speaker 8: Oh, okay. Next, it's the end of the round.

[03:10:19] Speaker 2: End of the round, so basically, yeah, you guys move a bit further. You are noticing that, um, there's not as many goblins.

[03:10:26] Speaker 8: The ambush is thinning out?

[03:10:28] Speaker 2: Yeah, if it's thinning out, you're probably coming to the end of it, you think?

[03:10:32] Speaker 8: Uh, Onarra is on deck once this...

[03:10:34] Speaker 2: Okay, that's it for them. So, uh, the two MPCs would go, um, let's see, they're both ready and attack. The Squig gets next to them. Um, then up next then, um, Onarra.

[03:10:51] Speaker 6: All right, Onarra will...

[03:10:54] Speaker 8: Run as on deck.

[03:10:55] Speaker 6: Let's see, what's still in range? Five, 10, 15, 20, 25. Okay, so both of these two are still in range.

[03:11:05] Speaker 2: (laughs) They're getting arced.

[03:11:06] Speaker 10: Uh, well, no, uh, are either of those two damaged already?

[03:11:11] Speaker 2: Uh, let's see, red one and blue.

[03:11:15] Speaker 6: Didn't one take electric arc?

[03:11:17] Speaker 2: Um, blue two I think was when it took the electric arc.

[03:11:20] Speaker 6: Okay.

[03:11:21] Speaker 2: Okay.

[03:11:22] Speaker 6: Well-

[03:11:22] Speaker 2: Blue two's on twen- or no, red one has taken damage, blue two has taken damage.

[03:11:29] Speaker 8: Okay.

[03:11:30] Speaker 2: So red, blue.

[03:11:31] Speaker 8: So, red-

[03:11:32] Speaker 2: Who has not.

[03:11:32] Speaker 8: Red one, we're gonna target with, um, biting words, use my last use of that. So, uh, uh, ugh. Eh, 11. I'm just gonna-

[03:11:45] Speaker 2: One.

[03:11:45] Speaker 8: Doesn't hit. All right, so biting words is over, uh, and then now, yes, both of them are getting targeted with electric arc, so DC15 reflex save.

[03:11:56] Speaker 2: Okay, so red gets a 20.

[03:12:00] Speaker 8: Uh, passes.

[03:12:00] Speaker 2: So just a regular pass. Blue-It's a 22, so that's probably just a regular pass.

[03:12:06] Speaker 11: Yep. All right. So it's-

[03:12:07] Speaker 12: What the hell are people doing at 10:00 on a Friday night?

[03:12:09] Speaker 11: So two regular passes. And four damage. So two is, two is what they'll take.

[03:12:16] Speaker 2: I say they have a high armor... They have a surprisingly high armor class. It's pretty good, so...

[03:12:21] Speaker 11: That was a reflex saving throw.

[03:12:22] Speaker 12: But if you're working at 9:00 on a Friday night, I'm gonna-

[03:12:23] Speaker 11: All right. Well, I did my best. (laughs)

[03:12:25] Speaker 12: ... slow 'em down.

[03:12:25] Speaker 13: (laughs)

[03:12:26] Speaker 14: That's very good, Amy.

[03:12:27] Speaker 12: Woo, my friend.

[03:12:29] Speaker 14: (laughs)

[03:12:29] Speaker 2: Okay. Next up-

[03:12:30] Speaker 13: I have not enjoyed waiting for late-night approvals. Um, next up is Squid Red.

[03:12:35] Speaker 2: Squid Red, um, Red-

[03:12:37] Speaker 13: Aurelia's on deck.

[03:12:38] Speaker 2: He is in a, he has eight people.

[03:12:40] Speaker 15: Oh, thank you. That helps.

[03:12:41] Speaker 2: Welcome. Um, so one, two, three, four, five... Oh yeah, there's one more. Six of you guys, not eight. Six. He likes you, gonna jump right between the carts there.

[03:12:57] Speaker 13: Is she still prone?

[03:12:58] Speaker 2: Yeah, she is prone.

[03:12:59] Speaker 12: She has a gun now.

[03:13:00] Speaker 2: But-

[03:13:00] Speaker 12: She's laying down, like (punching noises).

[03:13:03] Speaker 15: Yeah, I do that.

[03:13:03] Speaker 2: He can see her doing things.

[03:13:04] Speaker 13: With her laser gun.

[03:13:05] Speaker 2: They're not smart but-

[03:13:06] Speaker 12: I mean crossbow.

[03:13:06] Speaker 13: Mm-hmm.

[03:13:07] Speaker 2: Um, but he's gonna take a chomp at you if he is-

[03:13:09] Speaker 13: Maybe your laser gun.

[03:13:10] Speaker 14: I just was hoping that there would be more of a penalty to try and attack as much as we-

[03:13:15] Speaker 2: Um-

[03:13:15] Speaker 12: There is.

[03:13:16] Speaker 14: (laughs)

[03:13:17] Speaker 12: Well, melee attack on somebody who's prone is easier.

[03:13:20] Speaker 2: Yeah, there's a-

[03:13:21] Speaker 12: 'Cause she's off, she's off balance basically.

[03:13:22] Speaker 13: Mm-hmm.

[03:13:23] Speaker 2: Yeah, but she's-

[03:13:23] Speaker 13: But it's in a cart with walls and stuff.

[03:13:25] Speaker 15: And cover.

[03:13:26] Speaker 12: Yeah, well there is, you said there's a minus one on everything here, right?

[03:13:29] Speaker 2: Yeah, but he rolled a 19 on the die.

[03:13:30] Speaker 13: Oh, fuck this. Nevermind.

[03:13:32] Speaker 15: Yeah, 19 still hits.

[03:13:33] Speaker 2: So it is-

[03:13:35] Speaker 13: Well, 19 on the die is maybe appropriate.

[03:13:36] Speaker 12: There's only 23 points of damage, don't worry.

[03:13:40] Speaker 2: Uh, he would deal six points.

[03:13:42] Speaker 15: Yay, I'm unconscious again.

[03:13:44] Speaker 12: Congratulations, you're dying too.

[03:13:45] Speaker 13: Hey, you're not on deck. Oh, the goblin rider is dead, right?

[03:13:50] Speaker 2: Um, he, he has one action left. He's gonna take an attack on, he has three people kind of in range of him there, 'cause he's kinda in between your two carts.

[03:13:57] Speaker 12: What? There's a goblin rider left? Oh, no.

[03:14:00] Speaker 13: No, he's right there.

[03:14:00] Speaker 2: He's by the other little-

[03:14:00] Speaker 13: So technically he can do whatever you two are, attack you. Actually, you haven't been attacked yet. He's gonna go right down the line and go after you.

[03:14:06] Speaker 15: Angry.

[03:14:07] Speaker 2: It's the mat penalty and he will miss.

[03:14:09] Speaker 13: Spreading some damage. Right, uh, next is me. I'm gonna swing away. Uh, that is a three. I got a hero point, why not?

[03:14:19] Speaker 2: (laughs)

[03:14:21] Speaker 13: Not trusting you. Uh, does a 17 hit?

[03:14:28] Speaker 11: That's good.

[03:14:28] Speaker 2: Uh, that we'll say yes.

[03:14:30] Speaker 13: Check. Oh yeah, it should've been 16 with the minus one.

[03:14:33] Speaker 2: Um, I'm gonna say yes just since we're trying to wrap these up. These guys have a surprisingly high AC.

[03:14:41] Speaker 13: And so that is 10 bludgeoning and three spirit.

[03:14:45] Speaker 2: Okay, that's enough to splatter him.

[03:14:46] Speaker 13: Okay, um...

[03:14:48] Speaker 15: Squish.

[03:14:49] Speaker 13: Second action. Aim true, Plia. Um, so that is a, I guess, one action for him to jab one and then third action to throw it, uh, 15 to hit.

[03:15:07] Speaker 2: That would miss.

[03:15:08] Speaker 13: Okay.

[03:15:09] Speaker 2: Plia, come on.

[03:15:11] Speaker 13: And that is my turn.

[03:15:12] Speaker 2: Oh. Next up.

[03:15:14] Speaker 13: Uh, next up is Squid Blue.

[03:15:18] Speaker 2: Oh. Um, he'll hop up. I'm gonna say he triggers two attacks of opportunity they had waiting, and we'll just say they bludgeon him to smoosh.

[03:15:28] Speaker 13: Smooshy.

[03:15:30] Speaker 12: Other one. Bluetooth, still there?

[03:15:33] Speaker 2: Oh, yeah. He's there.

[03:15:34] Speaker 13: Kotal's on deck.

[03:15:34] Speaker 2: He'll pop in between two of you guys.

[03:15:37] Speaker 12: Bring it. I haven't been attacked.

[03:15:40] Speaker 2: Yeah, he'll do that, and we haven't had a chance for you to use your parry yet.

[03:15:42] Speaker 15: They like me. Why do they like me?

[03:15:44] Speaker 12: Parry just increases my AC by one.

[03:15:45] Speaker 13: You put yourself in the path.

[03:15:45] Speaker 11: It's not actually, uh, right near where they could get to you easiest while they were following us.

[03:15:50] Speaker 2: Oh, that'd be 19.

[03:15:51] Speaker 12: (laughs) Parry, no.

[03:15:53] Speaker 2: (laughs)

[03:15:53] Speaker 12: My AC 20 with parry.

[03:15:56] Speaker 11: Nice.

[03:15:57] Speaker 2: He looks disappointed.

[03:15:58] Speaker 11: Real good.

[03:15:58] Speaker 2: And we'll say that's his turn. Go ahead.

[03:16:01] Speaker 13: Oh, when, uh, Aurelia went down, I got a bunch of glory so I got, I sure got some HPs.

[03:16:06] Speaker 12: 20.

[03:16:06] Speaker 2: What's that?

[03:16:06] Speaker 12: 20.

[03:16:07] Speaker 2: That hits.

[03:16:09] Speaker 12: That is, oh, sadly only five damage.

[03:16:12] Speaker 2: (laughs)

[03:16:14] Speaker 12: And we'll give him one more for good measure 'cause there's a crit on every die. No. Well, that's a 14 with the minus three.

[03:16:24] Speaker 2: Yeah, I would say no.

[03:16:25] Speaker 12: For the third attack. (laughs)

[03:16:28] Speaker 13: Uh, Goblin end of the round.

[03:16:30] Speaker 12: Only one's left.

[03:16:31] Speaker 2: End of the round? So basically now at the end of the round you guys continue on, the goblins pass away.

[03:16:35] Speaker 12: We get away.

[03:16:35] Speaker 2: He, um, starts falling behind wistfully.

[03:16:37] Speaker 12: 'Cause he's not gonna make it to his friends.

[03:16:39] Speaker 2: But, uh, he'll give up in time 'cause he lost his friends.

[03:16:42] Speaker 12: Is she stable?

[03:16:44] Speaker 2: Um, Lynn would go back and stabilize you.

[03:16:46] Speaker 13: Okay.

[03:16:46] Speaker 2: And eventually, yeah, you, you'll wake up a few minutes later down the road. So you guys have passed the goblin ambush. You continue on for the remainder of the, uh, day, and overnight you guys get another chance to rest up and heal and whatnot. Um, basically you guys travel on for another few days. Um, again it takes, uh, the whole trek is like, uh, you know, two or three week process. But after a few more harrowing days, um-

[03:17:09] Speaker 13: It's a long rest.

[03:17:10] Speaker 2: Uh, yeah, a long rest, you guys are all good. Um, you, you make your way to Tigrum's Cross and you eventually come through a clearing. You see a mighty wide river, um, and this is almost like maybe the size of the Missouri in certain places here in Wisconsin.

[03:17:24] Speaker 13: Oh.

[03:17:24] Speaker 15: Oh.

[03:17:25] Speaker 2: So it's a, it's not like the Mississippi that's miles wide, but it's, it's fairly wide. Um-

[03:17:29] Speaker 12: Mississippi's never miles wide.

[03:17:30] Speaker 13: Yeah. (laughs)

[03:17:31] Speaker 12: (laughs)

[03:17:32] Speaker 2: People say it is, I haven't-

[03:17:33] Speaker 13: It's not.

[03:17:34] Speaker 12: ... reached over-

[03:17:34] Speaker 13: It's never a mile wide.

[03:17:35] Speaker 12: It might be 1,000 feet wide-

[03:17:37] Speaker 13: There you go.

[03:17:37] Speaker 12: ... but it is not 10,000 feet wide.

[03:17:39] Speaker 13: Yeah.

[03:17:40] Speaker 2: But this is at least like the Missi- Missouri size where, um-

[03:17:44] Speaker 12: Big river.

[03:17:45] Speaker 13: Big, big.

[03:17:45] Speaker 2: ... you see a massive... You see a massive bridge over it, you see a few buildings on the bridge, um-

[03:17:49] Speaker 12: A bridge on it, you say? Have we ever seen an incredible bridge miniature that was printed? (laughs)

[03:17:55] Speaker 13: (laughs)

[03:17:55] Speaker 2: Mm, some of you may have. I don't bring it down and set it up 'cause that'll take some time to draw up, but who knows? You guys come next week, there might be a bridge set up. So yeah, you guys have reached there. Now basically I'll point out, you guys have met two of the, um, I didn't cover this yet, but you've met two of the, um-Non-NPCs are the same. So we have Dramatis Personae. If you've read the, part of the rules, and again I don't know if everyone did, about Dramatis Personae, um-

[03:18:20] Speaker 16: Make friends with people.

[03:18:21] Speaker 2: Yep, you guys can make friends with them. They are... I wanted this... So there's gonna be a select number, and once you guys have been introduced to all of them, that's when you hit level two. So, might be a, a session or two down the road. But, um-

[03:18:31] Speaker 17: Which two are those? Is that... Is one of those the old guy?

[03:18:34] Speaker 2: Yep.

[03:18:34] Speaker 17: Yeah, okay.

[03:18:35] Speaker 16: That's Glenn.

[03:18:35] Speaker 2: So, Dramatis Personae, so a little bit about them.

[03:18:37] Speaker 17: Who?

[03:18:37] Speaker 2: Um, starting when you guys get to level, I think three, you can start trying to become friends with them.

[03:18:42] Speaker 17: Yeah.

[03:18:42] Speaker 2: You're gonna earn coins, and you can spend the coins on a lot of different things. I'll kind of explain that, but once you become a friend with one, I'll give you, uh, um... You get a special c- coin where you can spend that to then earn... You have to have one of the, one of your NPCs, but they can teach you a few different, uh, traits. Um, but these guys, so I wanted it to be so that as far as, like, finding NPCs, you don't have to remember a laundry list of NPCs. There will be minor Dramatis Personae, but as far as the major ones, there will be a set number. And so there will be maybe kind of points you get to in the plot where they, uh, um, will, uh, know things. Like I don't care what you roll on your knowledge check, you might have to investigate and do some investigation. So chances are they can either tell you or they can lead you in that direction. There's chances you're gonna have where you can learn a new skill or a new language. And if it would be if you befriended one of the, uh, uh, Dramatis Personae, they can teach you that. Um, so we'll get into that a little bit more as you get there. But there are gonna be chances to do that. They may even be able to do things for you if you're, um, interested. If you... You can be friends with any number of the Dramatis Personae, but you can raise it at certain points, you know, like a good friend or a best friend, like a really good, you know, higher levels. Um, you can only have one Dramatis Persona that you get to, like, a good or best friend type status. But as you do that, there's also like a lot more lore that will happen. There's also... You may get new quests by talking to them. So there's gonna be a set number, a few more than there are in the party. I won't tell you the exact number, but more than five. Um, but, you know, they're the ones that are, will be, like I said, a lot of the stuff you can, kind of fun stuff. You know, as we play along a bit further you'll get to know that. But you have so far met two of them.

[03:20:25] Speaker 18: Okay. Sounds good.

[03:20:25] Speaker 17: Cool.

[03:20:25] Speaker 16: One of them seems like he wants to be my best friend.

[03:20:28] Speaker 17: Hmm.

[03:20:28] Speaker 2: He does. I will point out, some of them will have some-

[03:20:31] Speaker 19: I get that vibes too.

[03:20:32] Speaker 2: Some of them will have some similarities to some of your guys, but you don't necessarily have to choose them.

[03:20:36] Speaker 18: Uh, sometimes opposites attract. (dice shuffling)

[03:20:38] Speaker 2: If you do have NPCs, like-

[03:20:39] Speaker 19: Sometimes they do.

[03:20:40] Speaker 2: Again, you can be friends with any number of the Dramatis Personae. (ding) You can try and get to that level.

[03:20:43] Speaker 19: Oh.

[03:20:43] Speaker 2: But if you really want to get to the best friend status, you can pick any you want to. It doesn't have to-

[03:20:47] Speaker 19: I'm gonna guess I'm not dying too, anymore, right?

[03:20:49] Speaker 2: No, no.

[03:20:49] Speaker 17: No, you are-

[03:20:49] Speaker 2: Good to go. But at the end-

[03:20:51] Speaker 17: Stabilized and I'm healed, so even wounded it probably goes away.

[03:20:53] Speaker 2: So remember this for next week. Um, he'll give you guys all 10 gold for your wonderful duties here, um-

[03:20:58] Speaker 19: 10 gold? Woo!

[03:20:59] Speaker 2: ... when you get to the bridge. But remember that market in there next week, if anyone does want to be the treasurer, we'll hand out the coin. Otherwise I'll do it. Um, and we'll start playing with the coin at that point.

[03:21:08] Speaker 17: Should we not even bother to add 10 gold to our-

[03:21:10] Speaker 2: You can add gold.

[03:21:11] Speaker 17: ... cash register, or-

[03:21:11] Speaker 2: Yeah, add 10 into it, um-

[03:21:12] Speaker 17: Okay.

[03:21:12] Speaker 2: ... if you'll do that now, I'll just weigh it out and then give you the totals next week and I'll... (dice shuffling) We'll hand out coins.

[03:21:19] Speaker 17: Good. I need to replace the javelin. Also I'm gonna heal this kid.

[03:21:23] Speaker 19: I thought you picked up the javelin you threw?

[03:21:25] Speaker 2: Oh, no, he chucked it at Squig. (hand slapping)

[03:21:26] Speaker 18: I just threw it on during the lagging.

[03:21:28] Speaker 20: Oh, okay.

[03:21:30] Speaker 19: They were called Squigs?

[03:21:32] Speaker 2: Yeah.

[03:21:32] Speaker 17: All right, are we done?

[03:21:33] Speaker 18: We need to get Chuck a javelin and return it.

[03:21:34] Speaker 2: Yep, we're all set for tonight.

[03:21:35] Speaker 17: All right, I'm stopping the recording. All right.

[03:21:38] Speaker 16: Yeah, them all had one of those. They're handy.

[03:21:41] Speaker 2: I'll try to play around the week. Like I said, I think it's the-

[03:21:43] Speaker 17: Yeah.

[03:21:43] Speaker 2: ... Apple connection doesn't work.

[03:21:44] Speaker 17: No, I want to try something else.

[03:21:45] Speaker 2: Oh.

[03:21:46] Speaker 17: Hold on. Stop this.
