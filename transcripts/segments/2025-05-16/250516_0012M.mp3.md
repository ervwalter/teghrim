DURATION:3599.141
[00:59:59] Speaker 1: ... he's talking. Um, eventually he, you do see a large creature come up to the gate.

[01:00:04] Speaker 2: I whistle to try and get other people's attention.

[01:00:06] Speaker 1: Oh. Yeah, you guys would hear, you can join him out there.

[01:00:10] Speaker 2: Okay.

[01:00:10] Speaker 1: Um, he comes to the gate. He knocks and says, "Oh, what's this?" You, you realize there's a great big, uh, orc. Orc? (footsteps thudding) I choose, uh, you. And I'll get out some stuff here in a moment. You guys, I don't really have any Snotlings but-

[01:00:36] Speaker 3: (laughs)

[01:00:36] Speaker 1: ... just using regular goblins for now. (footsteps thudding) And we got an actual map too(footsteps thudding) and some other cool stuff. We're going to fight maybe, probably. Um, you know what? I'm gonna use this one. I'm gonna use this one. Down by the river.

[01:01:04] Speaker 4: That's at the big rescue, like river. But yeah, I saw the river there so... Okay. (footsteps thudding)

[01:01:21] Speaker 1: Yeah, I still haven't figured out my thing for creating a rescue... Oh, what do you know? (upbeat music) Oh, stop. Done. Fine, thank you. Okay, it's been an hour. Um, no one has spent a, uh, uh-

[01:01:41] Speaker 2: Here's my-

[01:01:41] Speaker 1: What you wanna call it, so go ahead and roll.

[01:01:46] Speaker 5: Oh. 10.

[01:01:48] Speaker 4: Five.

[01:01:48] Speaker 6: 20.

[01:01:49] Speaker 1: Oh, deal.

[01:01:50] Speaker 6: The first, first good roll is this one.

[01:01:53] Speaker 1: (laughs)

[01:01:53] Speaker 3: Well, now you have an extra zero point for when you roll bad again.

[01:01:55] Speaker 4: Did you even try your... Are you even trying your eyeball dice?

[01:01:58] Speaker 6: I don't know, I was trying to use di- a different one since this is a new campaign but maybe I need to go back to the eyeball dice.

[01:02:10] Speaker 1: There's some... Uh.

[01:02:14] Speaker 4: Okay, where do you feel them?

[01:02:16] Speaker 1: These are just basically the walls. They're not... They're actually much taller, they're not piles of... So basically the, you know, kind of this area is here. And then you have the caravans are in here. Your guys' gate is right there, and there's another gate on the other side. Um, there's a little fire burning in the middle. I could set that out but I don't know if it's... So, you guys are kind of in this area.

[01:02:36] Speaker 6: Oh, fuck.

[01:02:37] Speaker 3: (coughs)

[01:02:39] Speaker 1: Yeah, why not, let's put out some stuff, make it look like... Ooh. Yeah, that's nice. There's some tents going up.

[01:02:52] Speaker 3: (coughs)

[01:03:07] Speaker 1: That's nice. Yeah, you guys have some... (chair creaking) There's some trees. Well, they're not probably quite so close but they've been felled away a little bit. Okay.

[01:03:28] Speaker 5: Battery fell out.

[01:03:30] Speaker 1: What's that?

[01:03:30] Speaker 5: The battery fell out.

[01:03:32] Speaker 1: Yeah. Oh yeah, it was, it was... I have to put it in each time we use it. There we go.

[01:03:41] Speaker 4: Is your mini the one with the staff?

[01:03:43] Speaker 1: Hmm?

[01:03:44] Speaker 4: Is your mini the one with the staff?

[01:03:47] Speaker 1: This guy here, that's Lynn. I don't think-

[01:03:49] Speaker 4: Oh.

[01:03:49] Speaker 1: ... I ever introduced him to you, so. Sylvia and Lynn kind of get with you guys too, you guys are kind of right up there.

[01:03:55] Speaker 6: Where'd mine go? Oh, there it is. Okay, you just had to put it out, yeah.

[01:03:58] Speaker 1: You can put yourself wherever you'd like to be. There's an orc on the other side of the gate.

[01:04:05] Speaker 3: (coughs)

[01:04:06] Speaker 1: And there's some little goblins around them. These are very young ones, very s- somewhat similar to the one you saw. And he says, "I'm, I'm just here to, to talk. I had some little kids out there s- exploring this place and they've gone missing. Don't suppose you fine folk would know what's going on here?"

[01:04:28] Speaker 2: We haven't seen 'em.

[01:04:30] Speaker 3: Would I have known, uh, the, the ones he's looking for would be the three I killed?

[01:04:35] Speaker 1: Um, it's, uh, you would, uh, surmise that.

[01:04:38] Speaker 3: Mm-hmm. Okay. I'm just, hmm, yeah.

[01:04:41] Speaker 2: No reason to confess that.

[01:04:43] Speaker 3: Nope, not gonna say anything and try to like, make it seem-

[01:04:48] Speaker 1: (laughs)

[01:04:48] Speaker 3: Maybe make him not notice me right away.

[01:04:50] Speaker 1: Whistle and look off in the distance.

[01:04:52] Speaker 2: We don't know anything about that. Be on your way now.

[01:04:55] Speaker 3: (clears throat)

[01:04:58] Speaker 1: Now, uh, it would not be right for me if I didn't go in there and see what's gone on. Um, (clears throat) and after all this caravan's gone through our territory and you haven't, uh, paid the toll.

[01:05:12] Speaker 6: It's a free road, no toll, not for you.

[01:05:15] Speaker 3: (laughs)

[01:05:17] Speaker 1: He says, "Well, I'm a, um-"

[01:05:20] Speaker 6: You all notice that it hit my, uh, tattoos are starting to glow faintly.

[01:05:25] Speaker 3: You are not welcome here. Leave now.

[01:05:30] Speaker 4: Like your chest is full of tattoos and you're-

[01:05:32] Speaker 1: He seems a little taken back when he looks at your guy. He says, "What? He's even greener than us."

[01:05:36] Speaker 4: Got it.

[01:05:36] Speaker 1: "How'd you get him? And what..." And he kind of looks at you and he has dark vision but he's look, he's staring at you like, "How'd you guys get someone greener? You're the most strange kind of orc I ever saw."

[01:05:46] Speaker 3: "It's not about the color of your skin but the content of your character."

[01:05:50] Speaker 1: "What? And you-"

[01:05:53] Speaker 4: "I tend to stay in the shadow."

[01:05:54] Speaker 1: "The only toll you'll get is from old Bessie here." And I slam the maul against my hand.

[01:05:59] Speaker 3: Ow.

[01:06:01] Speaker 1: Oh, he says, "Well, I was gonna be nice, and I was, uh..." Granted, I cannot do a Cockney accent.

[01:06:07] Speaker 7: (laughs)

[01:06:08] Speaker 1: If you guys ever listened to Warhammer, anything tied to Warhammer.

[01:06:11] Speaker 8: Mm-hmm.

[01:06:11] Speaker 1: Orcs always have a British, Cockney accent.

[01:06:14] Speaker 7: Ugh.

[01:06:14] Speaker 9: Yeah.

[01:06:15] Speaker 1: But I can't do a British, Cockney accent. So that, if you can imagine it, that's what I'm gunning for. He says, "Well, was gonna try doing this the nice way, but, uh, well I suppose-"

[01:06:24] Speaker 7: (laughs)

[01:06:25] Speaker 1: "... we're just gonna have to, uh, come in and extract our toll, um, as it is." And you can roll initiative.

[01:06:32] Speaker 8: Woo.

[01:06:32] Speaker 1: So does someone wanna track or...

[01:06:34] Speaker 10: Yeah, I can do that.

[01:06:36] Speaker 9: Would they have not noticed me?

[01:06:38] Speaker 1: You can roll yours, your initiative using stealth if you want, since you were trying to hide.

[01:06:45] Speaker 10: Mm-hmm.

[01:06:45] Speaker 7: And you just add your stealth bonus instead of your-

[01:06:48] Speaker 1: Yeah, basically instead of initiative, you roll.

[01:06:49] Speaker 8: I'll roll a stealth check instead of a perception check. Ancestors. And when I roll initiative, I go into a rage. (dices clattering) Oh, yeah.

[01:07:02] Speaker 7: Hm.

[01:07:04] Speaker 11: She has actions.

[01:07:07] Speaker 1: Okay, Matthew's character, whose name I may or may not know.

[01:07:10] Speaker 11: Uh, my character's name is, uh, Arnor.

[01:07:15] Speaker 1: Arnor?

[01:07:16] Speaker 11: A-R-N-O-R.

[01:07:17] Speaker 1: Okay. You guys haven't really introduced yourself, although the three of you probably have learned each other's name, I'm guessing, off the here and then.

[01:07:22] Speaker 10: I think it's initiative by player name, too.

[01:07:24] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[01:07:24] Speaker 10: So I'm just gonna use that.

[01:07:25] Speaker 1: Plus, we are gonna get to another event we call a campfire, which we just haven't done yet, but...

[01:07:30] Speaker 10: Uh, so what's your initiative been?

[01:07:31] Speaker 11: Uh, 14.

[01:07:33] Speaker 8: I thought you didn't wanna s- stay and stuff around campfires.

[01:07:37] Speaker 1: Oh, no, when we get to the campfire, um, we're kinda cover this stuff too.

[01:07:40] Speaker 11: The difference between, uh, in-character and out-of-character stuff.

[01:07:43] Speaker 1: (laughs)

[01:07:43] Speaker 9: True.

[01:07:43] Speaker 8: 'Cause in-character, your character can say whatever your character would say.

[01:07:47] Speaker 11: Yeah. Your character does not have a character sheet with their abilities on it.

[01:07:50] Speaker 9: That's true, yeah.

[01:07:50] Speaker 11: So you're not gonna be like, "I have a plus three to blah, blah, blah."

[01:07:53] Speaker 9: Yes, that's very-

[01:07:53] Speaker 10: "You guys might not know this, but as a dwarf, I have darkvision."

[01:07:56] Speaker 9: (laughs) That's true.

[01:07:58] Speaker 10: Uh, Katie, what's your initiative?

[01:08:00] Speaker 7: 12.

[01:08:01] Speaker 8: I have some familiarity with your people. I am-

[01:08:04] Speaker 10: Irv, what's your initiative?

[01:08:04] Speaker 8: ... inclined that I rolled a 15-

[01:08:07] Speaker 10: (laughs) Okay.

[01:08:08] Speaker 8: ... on my imaginary dice that Gaia has blessed me with.

[01:08:12] Speaker 10: What are the names of the baby goblins again? Snablings? Snabblings?

[01:08:17] Speaker 9: S- snabblings weren't Gits.

[01:08:18] Speaker 10: Snabblings, not Gits.

[01:08:18] Speaker 9: weren't Gits.

[01:08:18] Speaker 1: Sometimes they're called Gits, um, little Gits. Um... (dice clattering) What's Bay Spen is starting this shift, um, is he's gonna take his great big maul. He's gonna slam it up against the gate. And little chains are holding the gate together, just snap and the gate starts to swing open.

[01:08:46] Speaker 9: Is this a-

[01:08:47] Speaker 1: And that's launching the initiative.

[01:08:47] Speaker 9: ... metal gate? Wood gate?

[01:08:49] Speaker 1: Mostly wooden. And this is ver- kind of, you know, it's been built, it's recent, but it's also not super high-quality yet. So yeah, basically it's goblin's one through five, and then an orc.

[01:09:11] Speaker 10: Are the snablings each on their own initiative then?

[01:09:13] Speaker 1: Yeah, a lot of times I just let 'em do things on their own initiative. Or I might do them in pairs sometimes. We'll do these how about, we'll do 'em in pairs.

[01:09:21] Speaker 8: They don't number the bases. You have, we're not here for the introduction of the numbered basis.

[01:09:25] Speaker 10: Mm-hmm.

[01:09:26] Speaker 8: They're colored and numbered.

[01:09:28] Speaker 1: So Green doesn't, so I'm gonna have to make another batch, just in case.

[01:09:31] Speaker 10: I think they're only used in, uh, like-

[01:09:32] Speaker 1: One shot.

[01:09:33] Speaker 10: ... one through five.

[01:09:34] Speaker 1: Yeah, we did, um, use them in there a little bit. Got these from, uh, Pathfinder League. A guy passed on the files for this and it's kinda the coolest thing I... Was really happy he did. Oh, can we ask, well, if they need initiatives too?

[01:09:55] Speaker 10: So, you said in pairs, or they can go-

[01:09:57] Speaker 1: Yeah, we can do 'em in pairs.

[01:09:58] Speaker 10: Okay.

[01:09:58] Speaker 1: Um, so there'll be six of 'em all together.

[01:10:01] Speaker 10: Yep.

[01:10:04] Speaker 1: So, basically one and two are gonna be on one initiative, they're gonna be...

[01:10:08] Speaker 9: (yawns) Okay.

[01:10:12] Speaker 1: Oh, yeah. No, it's gonna be two NPCs. Well, we won't have the NPCs, they're gonna be fighting but they're not gonna be a part of the initiative, it's just not something to slow anything down. All right.

[01:10:25] Speaker 10: That sounds good.

[01:10:26] Speaker 1: Uh. Okay. Here somewhere. They put the initiatives in a really weird spot, so it's nuts.

[01:10:39] Speaker 8: (hiccups) Excuse me.

[01:10:41] Speaker 1: There we go, perception plus two.

[01:10:42] Speaker 8: (sighs).

[01:10:43] Speaker 1: Oh, so we have a 13 for a group one.

[01:10:45] Speaker 10: For a one, two?

[01:10:46] Speaker 1: One, two. Uh, three, four, is gonna be a 20, five, six is gonna be an 11, Orc Biggun... Orc Biggun's there. Uh, he (dice clattering) is a 10. We need a little more to work. Uh, here, I'm actually gonna get some water. Somebody said he wants some too, and I can do some.

[01:11:14] Speaker 7: (coughs).

[01:11:15] Speaker 1: I also do this at the moment here. Yeah.

[01:11:18] Speaker 10: So even though Gits, 34, go first.

[01:11:21] Speaker 1: Where did I... Oh, there he is. Yeah. There are no ties. Woo! Okay. Just put those there. (box slamming) Okay. Be right back. Anyone else want water or is there still any other stuff?

[01:11:42] Speaker 11: I'm good. I'm okay right now.

[01:11:44] Speaker 1: Right now? Irv, you something good? Well, usually good.

[01:11:46] Speaker 10: Good. Funny. (laughs) Let me get some.

[01:11:51] Speaker 1: And since Kent's not here, I'm gonna have to remember that yours is the one without water. Without ice.

[01:11:58] Speaker 7: Mm-hmm.

[01:12:31] Speaker 12: If any of you guys got storm damage from the, like, hail damage or anything through the storm?

[01:12:37] Speaker 13: No. I did have a cracked windshield that happened the same day, but before the storm happened.

[01:12:43] Speaker 12: (coughs)

[01:12:45] Speaker 13: Just drove my car to work and I was like, "What the hell is that?" That was fun. What about you, any damage?

[01:12:52] Speaker 12: No, but I heard it hailing at work and it hailed here, yeah, here in town, so...

[01:13:01] Speaker 13: Emily works from home, so she heard it and heard... Was surprised and so have I. Yeah, to be surprised.

[01:13:06] Speaker 12: Some of my, some of my family who live over, like, between Saint Paul and Madison. Um, apparently they had damage.

[01:13:15] Speaker 13: Hmm.

[01:13:16] Speaker 12: Like, if not siding damage, uh-

[01:13:19] Speaker 1: Okay, well. You know what's, I don't know if this is-

[01:13:22] Speaker 12: Like dents in car, like some extra, some new dents.

[01:13:25] Speaker 1: Yikes. I was seeing that 'cause my, well, my parents, when they first moved to Wisconsin from Montana, they had a big, um, hailstorm up north and it was so bad that they wound up getting, you know, new roofing, 'cause their insurance covered it. So I was watching that 'cause my house is probably about, uh, five or six years out from needing to get a new roof. And I was watching this going, "Do you know if this would just pick up a little bit, then maybe I can find hail damage."

[01:13:49] Speaker 12: This place?

[01:13:49] Speaker 1: Yeah. I'm getting clo-... Like I said, in five, five or six years, I'm gonna have to. But it sucks because I have to get another half and most places only do the entire roof, they won't do half of it. And I don't know how she's doing with being able to afford...

[01:14:04] Speaker 12: I was about to say, are you gonna go in good standing with your neighbor?

[01:14:07] Speaker 1: I mean, yeah, we get along and everything, but you don't have to... I don't know how... You know, I'm setting aside money now, I don't know how she's doing. Typically, we don't have to do much shared stuff. Probably that stupid tree we had to get cut down and whatnot, me and Mia started worrying about sharing stuff. So, first off-

[01:14:27] Speaker 13: Goblins three, four.

[01:14:29] Speaker 1: Okay.

[01:14:30] Speaker 13: Or he hits three, four. Come on deck.

[01:14:34] Speaker 1: Okay. Then we'll move forward and try to attack you guys, if you (...)

[01:14:44] Speaker 14: Okay. Hmm. Not too bad.

[01:14:52] Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I need to refill that, that candy cauldron here one of these days. So do you guys have any favorites? Um...

[01:14:58] Speaker 12: Sour Patch Kids.

[01:14:59] Speaker 15: (laughs)

[01:15:02] Speaker 1: Sour stuff? Okay. Let's see, one, two, three, four-

[01:15:06] Speaker 12: That and chocolate are, like, my go-to.

[01:15:12] Speaker 1: Okay. Uh, three and four there. Good guys in back, so one, two, three, four, five, so...

[01:15:23] Speaker 13: I think that's two.

[01:15:24] Speaker 1: Oh, two? Oh, yeah, that is two. Four is there and when is three?

[01:15:29] Speaker 12: Three is back, yep.

[01:15:29] Speaker 1: Three's over there. Oh. Uh, so one, oh, one, two, three. He's gonna move up to Irv and make an attack and then four-

[01:15:39] Speaker 13: Right.

[01:15:39] Speaker 1: ... is just gonna move up and run under the big by's, big guy's legs and he'll move up to you. Um, then he'll make an attack on you guys.

[01:15:46] Speaker 12: Um. Okay.

[01:15:48] Speaker 1: They have their crude little goblin weapons. They have little dog slicers. One, two, three, four, five, six. Well, so, actually I didn't realize who it was against, so even/odd. Even. So, Irv, they're attacking you. He has a 25 to hit.

[01:16:13] Speaker 13: That's hit.

[01:16:13] Speaker 1: And for six points, ouch. Um, he'll take another attack on you since he has one and he'll miss horribly. On you, two attacks.

[01:16:26] Speaker 13: AC18.

[01:16:27] Speaker 1: First one's, um, 24.

[01:16:30] Speaker 13: It's-

[01:16:30] Speaker 1: Or five points of damage. And second one is not that nearly that much. Okay, next up.

[01:16:40] Speaker 13: Hey, uh, next is me. Irv is on deck.

[01:16:42] Speaker 1: Okay.

[01:16:43] Speaker 15: (laughs)

[01:16:43] Speaker 1: And luckily now because of the new rules, you start raging instead of having to waste an action, which is nice.

[01:16:49] Speaker 13: Well, I was already even before that, like, just on initiative.

[01:16:52] Speaker 1: Yeah, they, they got that now and the old one, in the older rules, you had to wait 'til your first turn and spend your first action to rage.

[01:16:56] Speaker 13: Uh-huh. Yeah.

[01:16:57] Speaker 1: Which sucked.

[01:16:58] Speaker 13: Yeah, if I was wearing heavy armor, I'd still have to do that, but...

[01:17:00] Speaker 1: Oh.

[01:17:02] Speaker 13: Um, okay, I will whack at number, um-

[01:17:06] Speaker 1: Four was the one in front of you. Um, if you move or unless you have reach, you could hit number three.

[01:17:12] Speaker 13: Yeah. That guy was mean to me.

[01:17:16] Speaker 1: Or you can put yourself in to make a flank and take on the big guy.

[01:17:19] Speaker 13: Yeah. Oh, yeah, I thought it would be flanks. I don't wanna do that, that-

[01:17:26] Speaker 1: Well, depending on where you go, they could line up flanks and put it that way.

[01:17:29] Speaker 13: Mm-hmm. Um, yeah, I think I'll just whack on number four then. Right in front of me, that was four. Yep. Okay. That is a 22 to hit.

[01:17:39] Speaker 1: That'll hit. Let me just-

[01:17:40] Speaker 13: Yeah, it's not a crit, but not too far off. Ooh, that's really high. Um, 15 bludgeoning and 30 spirit. (laughs)

[01:17:48] Speaker 1: Okay, well, what happens to him? He gets splattered pretty bad.

[01:17:51] Speaker 13: Here bada, bada, bada. (laughs)

[01:17:54] Speaker 1: (laughs) So you, you pop him over and land him on one of the spikes that you set up basically?

[01:17:58] Speaker 13: Mm-hmm.

[01:17:59] Speaker 1: Okay, four gets splattered.

[01:18:02] Speaker 13: That's one action.

[01:18:03] Speaker 1: I have, yep. Mm-hmm. Other action.

[01:18:11] Speaker 13: I guess I'll just move here, try and make a defensive line.

[01:18:19] Speaker 16: Here. That was a... 11 hit.

[01:18:37] Speaker 17: That will not hit.

[01:18:37] Speaker 16: Yeah, and that is my turn. (dice clattering) Uh, next up is Irv. And Matthew's on deck.

[01:18:47] Speaker 18: Oh.

[01:18:50] Speaker 17: Um, I'm trying to retract just a little bit. Yeah.

[01:18:55] Speaker 19: There's one in front of you. Does it need new batteries?

[01:19:04] Speaker 17: Yeah, or something. I'll have to, um, find out. I can hear it enough. Um... Um... (coughing)

[01:19:10] Speaker 16: Stuck me into flanking.

[01:19:10] Speaker 17: Uh, you can... Well-

[01:19:10] Speaker 18: Oh, is there a wall there?

[01:19:10] Speaker 17: I didn't see... He's, he's-

[01:19:10] Speaker 16: Yeah, it's kind of a-

[01:19:10] Speaker 17: I don't know.

[01:19:10] Speaker 18: I think it'd be more. I didn't know which squares it was in.

[01:19:11] Speaker 17: Yeah. Would you have stepped differently if you knew that, to, uh, point out, because you could have.

[01:19:28] Speaker 18: Uh.

[01:19:28] Speaker 17: Maybe.

[01:19:31] Speaker 18: Not.

[01:19:31] Speaker 17: No, I don't think I would've, 'cause I don't wanna get flanked by these guys.

[01:19:51] Speaker 18: Oh.

[01:19:54] Speaker 17: Besides the one guy I'm already flanked, but hoping he'll go down fast.

[01:19:59] Speaker 16: And he's down.

[01:20:00] Speaker 17: Good.

[01:20:02] Speaker 16: Squares. There we go. Okay. Where was I again? Plus two?

[01:20:10] Speaker 17: Yep. Well, it reduces their AC base.

[01:20:13] Speaker 16: Minus to AC.

[01:20:14] Speaker 17: Oh, minus to, to them.

[01:20:18] Speaker 16: I want to, uh, actually go through him. With Tumble through.

[01:20:28] Speaker 17: The goblin?

[01:20:28] Speaker 16: Yeah, and get on the other side.

[01:20:30] Speaker 17: So you can do a, uh, acrobatics.

[01:20:33] Speaker 16: It's, uh, 19.

[01:20:35] Speaker 17: What's that?

[01:20:36] Speaker 16: 19.

[01:20:37] Speaker 17: 19 versus... I think that's reflex DC?

[01:20:39] Speaker 16: I don't know. I should learn that. It's gonna happen a lot.

[01:20:42] Speaker 17: That works. You do reflect off-

[01:20:44] Speaker 16: So, like, I want to go, get in between, actually, no, between the two little dudes.

[01:20:50] Speaker 17: This way? Yeah, you can... Yeah.

[01:20:52] Speaker 16: It's not technically flanked for them because-

[01:20:56] Speaker 18: That's fine.

[01:20:56] Speaker 16: He'd have to move. The other one would have to move.

[01:20:57] Speaker 17: Yeah. He'd have to move.

[01:20:58] Speaker 16: But he's not... Hopefully not going to be alive.

[01:21:00] Speaker 17: Technically, yeah, they're, they're like, it's, uh, chess night move. They are. Uh, chess night move (laughs) onto each other. I'm going to, um, do two attacks with one action.

[01:21:13] Speaker 18: Just remember they have the sec- the map attacks. Uh, it does still affect them.

[01:21:17] Speaker 16: I know. I'm not using ability names because I don't want to give away my class.

[01:21:23] Speaker 17: No, we have no idea and you didn't even talk about it before this campaign, so I'm thrilled with the idea.

[01:21:28] Speaker 19: (Laughs) You had multiple character ideas that-

[01:21:31] Speaker 16: You... Can you decide how the second one is targeted after you find out what the first one af- happens, or do you have to pick before?

[01:21:38] Speaker 18: I under... I'll... Do you read, read it under the old one?

[01:21:42] Speaker 16: It doesn't say. It just says, "Make two attacks."

[01:21:44] Speaker 19: Thank you.

[01:21:45] Speaker 16: But I don't know if I can know that the first attack kills the first one.

[01:21:49] Speaker 19: Oh.

[01:21:49] Speaker 16: Because these are whippy.

[01:21:50] Speaker 18: Yeah, we can only do... I think under the prior one, the attacks this... The ability had to be used on one enemy. Um, this one is-

[01:21:58] Speaker 16: This specifically says, "If they both hit the same creature," which implies they might not hit the same creature.

[01:22:03] Speaker 19: I think yours are weird.

[01:22:03] Speaker 18: Um, thank you.

[01:22:04] Speaker 16: It just says, "Make two creatures"-

[01:22:05] Speaker 18: Yeah, I'd say we'll just spend one at a time.

[01:22:07] Speaker 16: Okay.

[01:22:08] Speaker 18: Um, well, I'm going to roll them at the same time because if they both hit, they get added together and I don't want to have to memorize the first damage. Um, so I have two different colored dice. That's why it gets mixed up. So it, it's going to be both on the guy out there, unless the first one, it killed him and then the second one will go on the boss because I have leech. Oh, okay.

[01:22:31] Speaker 16: And yellow is first, purple is second. So first is... Scrolled away from my attack bonus. 19?

[01:22:43] Speaker 17: 19 will hit.

[01:22:45] Speaker 16: Hang on, there's a one. Doesn't matter.

[01:22:47] Speaker 19: Nice.

[01:22:47] Speaker 16: Um, so the first one is the only one that hits and that was, uh, on the little guy. Um, 11.

[01:22:57] Speaker 17: 11 damage?

[01:22:58] Speaker 16: Bludgeoning.

[01:22:59] Speaker 17: Okay. Yep, you flung him. You threw him good on the-

[01:23:02] Speaker 19: You hear the staff.

[01:23:03] Speaker 17: Yeah. Flung him pretty good on the head.

[01:23:07] Speaker 16: And my third action is to position my staff defensively.

[01:23:12] Speaker 17: Okay. And next is Matthew. Uh, hits one and two are on deck.

[01:23:19] Speaker 18: Okay.

[01:23:19] Speaker 19: All right. Must be at the bottom.

[01:23:21] Speaker 17: Uh, I'm going to cast, uh, nudge fate.

[01:23:23] Speaker 18: You're after the hits, one and two.

[01:23:25] Speaker 17: I'm going to cast nudge fate on you.

[01:23:27] Speaker 18: Oh, okay.

[01:23:28] Speaker 19: Nudge fate.

[01:23:29] Speaker 17: "When the target fails an attack roll, skill check or saving throw and a plus one bonus would turn a crit fail into a fail or a failure into a success, you grant the target a plus one bonus to the check retroactively. Lasts for a minute."

[01:23:43] Speaker 16: Cool. So it's basically fail by one, get plus one?

[01:23:47] Speaker 17: Yep. Uh, fail or crit fail. Crit fail to a fail or fail to a success, but it won't turn a success into a crit success.

[01:23:56] Speaker 18: Lame.

[01:23:57] Speaker 17: Yeah.

[01:23:58] Speaker 18: Yeah.

[01:23:58] Speaker 17: It is lame. I just realized I should have added plus one to attacks against goblins due to my mountain stronghold stone, but-

[01:24:05] Speaker 18: (laughs)

[01:24:05] Speaker 17: ... yeah, well, next time. Um, so I got maybe do... Is that a circumstance bonus?

[01:24:10] Speaker 20: I don't know if there's an actual, like, condition for it, but yeah, that's what it would... I think it would count as.

[01:24:15] Speaker 18: Just 'cause I already have a plus one circumstance bonus-

[01:24:17] Speaker 17: You can, yeah. Take it 'cause it might be

[01:24:19] Speaker 21: So I don't put status?

[01:24:20] Speaker 19: Just add two.

[01:24:21] Speaker 20: Status bonus.

[01:24:22] Speaker 17: Oh, it's a status bonus.

[01:24:23] Speaker 20: Oh, then yeah, I think we're good. It's a status bonus, not a circumstance bonus.

[01:24:26] Speaker 22: Yay.

[01:24:26] Speaker 23: (laughs)

[01:24:27] Speaker 22: Um, and then, uh, I am going to cast... needle darts.

[01:24:35] Speaker 18: Was that a one action for the one on him, or was it-

[01:24:37] Speaker 22: Yep.

[01:24:37] Speaker 18: Oh, wow. That's pretty good.

[01:24:38] Speaker 22: Yeah.

[01:24:38] Speaker 18: Well, it's always a little counter like... It's a good little one-action counter.

[01:24:42] Speaker 22: Yeah. Ba- basically, we should always go into or-

[01:24:46] Speaker 18: (laughs)

[01:24:46] Speaker 22: ... shortly after a ka- a combat starts, I should use that on somebody.

[01:24:50] Speaker 18: Oh, yeah.

[01:24:52] Speaker 22: Um, since he seems like our front-liner right now and went with him.

[01:24:55] Speaker 18: Grr. (laughs)

[01:24:56] Speaker 22: Um, (smacks lips) all right. So, I'm going to make a spell attack roll against the guy in charge. To work.

[01:25:05] Speaker 18: You can definitely see him standing over the, um-

[01:25:07] Speaker 22: (coughs).

[01:25:07] Speaker 18: I gave him cover 'cause those... 'cause those little snotlings are pretty small.

[01:25:10] Speaker 22: All right. (smacks lips)

[01:25:13] Speaker 18: And...

[01:25:14] Speaker 22: I was wrong. Again, it's plus one to damage, not to

[01:25:16] Speaker 24: Which one are you?

[01:25:16] Speaker 22: It's plus one to damage. Still, that's-

[01:25:18] Speaker 24: That's the bird one?

[01:25:19] Speaker 22: Uh, the guy right there.

[01:25:21] Speaker 18: Who did he work out.

[01:25:21] Speaker 24: He's right there. Yeah.

[01:25:21] Speaker 18: The bir- there's not a bird in your hand.

[01:25:23] Speaker 22: (clicks tongue) Maybe.

[01:25:24] Speaker 18: I don't know.

[01:25:25] Speaker 22: It was just a miniature I chose.

[01:25:26] Speaker 18: (laughs)

[01:25:26] Speaker 24: Okay.

[01:25:27] Speaker 25: What square, uh, what-

[01:25:27] Speaker 22: I'm also not carrying an ax.

[01:25:29] Speaker 18: Yeah.

[01:25:30] Speaker 22: I don't have an ax.

[01:25:31] Speaker 18: I found a cool guy that...

[01:25:33] Speaker 24: Right square.

[01:25:34] Speaker 18: Yeah. Kinda matched the Norn guy, but, uh... Oh, I didn't add tattoos to him. Ugh.

[01:25:39] Speaker 24: At least that's-

[01:25:40] Speaker 22: At least it's not a mispostage. It's not sealed.

[01:25:42] Speaker 18: Yeah. Uh, 21 to hit. That went.

[01:25:45] Speaker 23: Nice.

[01:25:46] Speaker 22: All right. Is it a-

[01:25:47] Speaker 25: You're jacking the big guy?

[01:25:48] Speaker 18: Yeah.

[01:25:49] Speaker 23: Yeah.

[01:25:49] Speaker 18: 21 hits.

[01:25:50] Speaker 22: All right. (dice drops) (smacks lips) No one else has been even hurt yet.

[01:25:55] Speaker 18: Well, ooh, yeah. Very badly.

[01:25:59] Speaker 22: Okay. (dice drops) And that is a total of 10 damage.

[01:26:03] Speaker 23: Just, oh, it was bad enough that we killed him. (laughs) That's true.

[01:26:06] Speaker 18: (laughs) They're very hurt.

[01:26:08] Speaker 23: Who?

[01:26:08] Speaker 18: Um, their ancestors are hurt.

[01:26:09] Speaker 22: And I don't think it'll matter, but I was using cold iron.

[01:26:12] Speaker 18: Can you call them hurt anymore?

[01:26:13] Speaker 22: So, the needle darts spell, um, imparts any special properties of the metal that forms them and-

[01:26:19] Speaker 18: Oh.

[01:26:19] Speaker 22: Like, I actually have to have metal present. So, as part of my starting gear, I bought a chunk of cold iron.

[01:26:24] Speaker 18: Okay. Yup.

[01:26:25] Speaker 22: So... I also have silver coins-

[01:26:27] Speaker 18: (laughs)

[01:26:27] Speaker 22: ... that I can use. The needles come back and put themselves back where they were at the end of the attack, so it's, uh-

[01:26:35] Speaker 23: You have unlimited cold iron. (laughs)

[01:26:36] Speaker 22: I only, I only have to buy one chunk and I can use it forever.

[01:26:39] Speaker 18: Yeah.

[01:26:40] Speaker 22: For-

[01:26:40] Speaker 18: That's a really useful spell.

[01:26:42] Speaker 22: Yeah. But it also means I'm not devaluing my silver coins by using them-

[01:26:46] Speaker 18: (laughs)

[01:26:46] Speaker 25: Have they all action-

[01:26:47] Speaker 22: If I need to do silver.

[01:26:48] Speaker 18: No, I think one and two went next.

[01:26:50] Speaker 23: Yeah, one and two go next.

[01:26:52] Speaker 18: Oh.

[01:26:52] Speaker 23: And then it's your turn.

[01:26:53] Speaker 18: Um, let's see. One.

[01:26:55] Speaker 22: But it's a, it's an if-

[01:26:56] Speaker 18: Well, w- one is dead, right?

[01:26:58] Speaker 23: Yes.

[01:26:59] Speaker 18: One is dead. So, two is the one that can go. You're the closest one. He would try to get in to flank.

[01:27:06] Speaker 22: Yeah, that's fine.

[01:27:07] Speaker 18: So, if you have an attack of opportunity, you- Not on this one.

[01:27:09] Speaker 22: (coughs)

[01:27:09] Speaker 18: He will take a swing at you. Uh, that'd be a 23 with flank.

[01:27:17] Speaker 23: That'll hit.

[01:27:17] Speaker 18: Oh. One thing you just gotta... A good useful thing is t- when you make your attack rolls against me, so I don't forget, if you're in flank, say it's, uh, 18 plus flank. That'll just give me a reminder so I don't forget, um, that, so...

[01:27:29] Speaker 23: Oh, that's a good call.

[01:27:29] Speaker 18: They would have a 23 plus flank against you.

[01:27:31] Speaker 23: Yeah, I have AC18 right now.

[01:27:33] Speaker 18: So, so... He zaps you-

[01:27:35] Speaker 23: Not, not bad.

[01:27:35] Speaker 18: ... with a knee for two points of damage.

[01:27:37] Speaker 23: Motherfucker.

[01:27:37] Speaker 18: Mother dog slicer.

[01:27:40] Speaker 23: Oh, you little one. I'm gonna getcha.

[01:27:43] Speaker 18: He looks at you. He had some success. He thinks he can back that up with a not success. That'd be 12.

[01:27:49] Speaker 23: Yeah.

[01:27:49] Speaker 18: Just misses. Um, that's it for them. I think you were up next.

[01:27:54] Speaker 23: Yep.

[01:27:54] Speaker 25: So we know what-

[01:27:55] Speaker 26: Katie's next.

[01:27:55] Speaker 25: I know what kind of creature they are, so.

[01:27:57] Speaker 18: Oh, yeah. You can... These are very similar. Maybe a little bit bigger than the ones you had, you killed earlier, but they're very similar. You know they're goblins.

[01:28:04] Speaker 23: You killed the ones earlier?

[01:28:06] Speaker 25: No, but I know-

[01:28:07] Speaker 23: (gasps)

[01:28:07] Speaker 25: ... that they're goblins.

[01:28:08] Speaker 18: (laughs)

[01:28:09] Speaker 23: Uh, next, after Katie, is a bunch of your guys, five, six, then the orc and then the Fjord.

[01:28:12] Speaker 18: Oh, there's this GM voice in the sky that's like, "They're very much like the ones you killed." I'm reading, uh, I started reading Dungeon Crawler Carl.

[01:28:18] Speaker 22: Oh, such a good book.

[01:28:20] Speaker 18: (laughs)

[01:28:20] Speaker 22: I haven't read the most recent one, but I've read the rest of-

[01:28:22] Speaker 18: I still have book one.

[01:28:23] Speaker 22: But I've read the rest of the series.

[01:28:24] Speaker 18: It's on, it's on level two.

[01:28:25] Speaker 22: Yeah.

[01:28:26] Speaker 18: It's a... If you haven't read it and you want a weird, fun book-

[01:28:29] Speaker 22: It's a fun one.

[01:28:30] Speaker 18: It's a... So, spoiler of the first, like, 15 pages. Uh, aliens show up at the Earth and kill everybody who was inside a building, but this guy named Carl was outside 'cause his cat ran out the window.

[01:28:43] Speaker 22: (laughs)

[01:28:43] Speaker 18: And so he's not killed. Um, and the aliens announce that they are taking over the planet, but the Earth, earthlings can keep the planet if somebody can make it through an 18-level world dungeon. They create a world dungeon that is pretty much a video game.

[01:28:55] Speaker 22: And then they treat it like it's a, uh, reality show.

[01:28:59] Speaker 18: And it's a-

[01:28:59] Speaker 22: (laughs)

[01:28:59] Speaker 18: You know, Hunger Games, Survivor-style, like, televised video game where you can... It's a... The Hunger Games thing is you can have patrons that will send you loot boxes.

[01:29:10] Speaker 25: (laughs)

[01:29:10] Speaker 18: There's loot boxes.

[01:29:11] Speaker 22: There's literal loot boxes.

[01:29:12] Speaker 18: There's XP. There's magic spell. Like it's-

[01:29:15] Speaker 22: It's, it's one of a-

[01:29:15] Speaker 18: It's fucking hilarious.

[01:29:16] Speaker 22: Mm-hmm.

[01:29:16] Speaker 18: And I won't tell you anything else about the plot-

[01:29:18] Speaker 27: Who's the author?

[01:29:19] Speaker 22: I can't remember his name. Um, it's one of the best lit RPGs.

[01:29:23] Speaker 27: Dunge- Dungeon Crawl Carl.

[01:29:24] Speaker 18: Dungeon Crawler Carl.

[01:29:26] Speaker 22: Dungeon Crawler Carl.

[01:29:27] Speaker 23: Dungeon Crawler Carl is the... And there's like-

[01:29:28] Speaker 22: He's, he's DCed.

[01:29:29] Speaker 18: ... seven books?

[01:29:30] Speaker 22: Yeah.

[01:29:30] Speaker 18: I saw the description of the seventh book and k- know that the... it's probably like a level per book since the seventh-

[01:29:39] Speaker 22: Probably, yeah.

[01:29:40] Speaker 18: ... book is level nine.

[01:29:41] Speaker 25: (laughs)

[01:29:42] Speaker 18: And I'm assuming the first book is one, two and three, which leaves one level for the next six books.

[01:29:46] Speaker 22: The author has promised-

[01:29:47] Speaker 18: Matt Dimoun.

[01:29:48] Speaker 22: ... that a single level will never take more than one book.

[01:29:51] Speaker 18: Okay.

[01:29:52] Speaker 22: So-

[01:29:52] Speaker 18: Oh.

[01:29:53] Speaker 22: Uh, but you could theoretically clear more than one level-

[01:29:56] Speaker 18: And you know, on a, on a single book. It's also slightly a spoiler to, like, chapter three or something like that. But-

[01:30:01] Speaker 25: Huh.

[01:30:01] Speaker 18: This isn't the first time this has happened. It's happened on lots of planets 'cause there turns out to be billions of planets in the universe. And so this is-

[01:30:07] Speaker 22: And it's just a group which is just Earth.

[01:30:08] Speaker 18: Which is why it's o- ongoing TV series and no one has ever won the game.

[01:30:12] Speaker 22: So-

[01:30:13] Speaker 23: Nope.

[01:30:14] Speaker 22: It's hilarious.

[01:30:14] Speaker 25: If I make everyone acknowledge-

[01:30:16] Speaker 23: It's one of the best Lit RPGs out there.

[01:30:16] Speaker 25: ... against a creature and identify what it is and succeed, it becomes off guard. Would that m- m- make sense doing here or no, since you're-

[01:30:26] Speaker 18: You still have to do a... I think you have to use that in combat. So, yeah, you'd have to do your recall knowledge.Um, I think it's the... I think you have to take an action to do that. And then, I don't know if this goes against all goblins. Um, it might. I can't remember exactly but...

[01:30:39] Speaker 28: Okay. Well, I'm gonna-

[01:30:40] Speaker 18: Because now you're probably doing a recall knowledge versus their combat abilities and whatnot.

[01:30:43] Speaker 28: Yeah, I'm gonna, uh, do a recall knowledge on number two. This would be what kind, what, uh, society?

[01:30:53] Speaker 18: Um, for these guys, nature. It doesn't matter when you're level one.

[01:30:59] Speaker 28: 15 plus two.

[01:31:00] Speaker 18: Like my trained nature is only-

[01:31:02] Speaker 28: Uh, yeah.

[01:31:02] Speaker 18: ... plus one.

[01:31:03] Speaker 28: You're right.

[01:31:03] Speaker 18: That is when you're level 10, you're gonna lose, if you're not trained.

[01:31:06] Speaker 28: That's true.

[01:31:06] Speaker 18: But got level one, level natural.

[01:31:07] Speaker 28: Not used, used to high level stuff. We gotta go back to level one. (laughs)

[01:31:11] Speaker 18: Um, we'll give it to you on this one.

[01:31:14] Speaker 28: Okay.

[01:31:14] Speaker 18: You know that they're orcs. Um, what kind of knowledge did you wanna know?

[01:31:17] Speaker 28: Uh, what are they immune to?

[01:31:22] Speaker 18: Goblins? Um, in a sense you can just say strengths or weaknesses. So if you're looking for like, um, strengths-

[01:31:26] Speaker 28: Oh.

[01:31:26] Speaker 18: ... stuff they're immune to. Um, pretty much nothing. Um-

[01:31:29] Speaker 28: Uh, okay. Okay, well, since I succeeded, it's number two is off guard.

[01:31:38] Speaker 18: Okay. (yawning) Now I have to look at the ability. I wonder if you get that against all?

[01:31:42] Speaker 28: But was that a crit succeed or just-

[01:31:44] Speaker 18: No, just-

[01:31:45] Speaker 28: Okay. So it's-

[01:31:46] Speaker 18: So is the number two off guard for everyone or just for you on this turn?

[01:31:49] Speaker 28: Just for me.

[01:31:50] Speaker 18: Yeah.

[01:31:50] Speaker 28: I believe.

[01:31:51] Speaker 18: And I think it gives her a precision damage too. This is a big guy.

[01:31:53] Speaker 1: Shh, we're not supposed to know. She's a rogue.

[01:31:57] Speaker 28: You don't know anything.

[01:31:59] Speaker 29: It's rogue mechanics.

[01:32:00] Speaker 28: So, okay. I mean, uh-

[01:32:01] Speaker 29: I'm pretty sure it's just the one target.

[01:32:02] Speaker 28: I wanna-

[01:32:02] Speaker 29: 'Cause I played around with it.

[01:32:04] Speaker 28: Okay. I'm gonna pull out a hand crossbow-

[01:32:05] Speaker 29: You have to do it every round.

[01:32:06] Speaker 28: ... and shoot it at number two.

[01:32:07] Speaker 29: Every turn, okay. Until you... Only one action to pull out the crossbow and your third action to shoot.

[01:32:11] Speaker 18: Mm-hmm.

[01:32:13] Speaker 1: That's a good roll.

[01:32:18] Speaker 28: 25.

[01:32:19] Speaker 18: Tell us about off, off guard.

[01:32:21] Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, plus off guard.

[01:32:23] Speaker 18: He gets a crit.

[01:32:24] Speaker 28: Yay.

[01:32:24] Speaker 18: Yeah, I was gonna say, that should be...

[01:32:26] Speaker 29: (laughs)

[01:32:26] Speaker 18: Who are you going for?

[01:32:27] Speaker 28: Number two.

[01:32:28] Speaker 18: Number two?

[01:32:28] Speaker 29: I'm gonna take-

[01:32:29] Speaker 18: The one closest to her?

[01:32:30] Speaker 28: 1d6.

[01:32:31] Speaker 18: You're the redhead?

[01:32:32] Speaker 29: Mm-hmm.

[01:32:32] Speaker 28: Ye- yeah.

[01:32:34] Speaker 18: Is that a cloak or a red hair?

[01:32:35] Speaker 29: Red hair.

[01:32:36] Speaker 18: Okay. I don't remember what you look like.

[01:32:38] Speaker 29: Well, it's a little different than that.

[01:32:40] Speaker 18: Okay, whatever.

[01:32:42] Speaker 28: Wait. Nine points of damage.

[01:32:51] Speaker 18: That's with crit or doubling it?

[01:32:53] Speaker 28: Uh, no.

[01:32:53] Speaker 18: No, he has-

[01:32:54] Speaker 28: Uh, 18 points of damage.

[01:32:55] Speaker 18: Oh, well, nice. Spoiler, it's dead.

[01:32:58] Speaker 29: (laughs)

[01:32:59] Speaker 18: I took less than that and killed one.

[01:33:00] Speaker 29: Little guy just stabbed you in the, in the leg and is staring at that all of a sudden just, you know, splatters-

[01:33:06] Speaker 18: Crossbow bolt comes out the front of his face.

[01:33:08] Speaker 29: (laughs)

[01:33:08] Speaker 28: I was gonna say, yeah, crossbow bolt right through the eye.

[01:33:10] Speaker 18: Mm-hmm.

[01:33:11] Speaker 28: Through the-

[01:33:12] Speaker 18: You shot him in the back of the head, so...

[01:33:14] Speaker 29: (laughs)

[01:33:15] Speaker 28: Back of the head comes out the eye.

[01:33:17] Speaker 30: Whoa. Um, that head was very close to my knee.

[01:33:20] Speaker 28: (laughs)

[01:33:21] Speaker 18: (laughs)

[01:33:21] Speaker 28: And that is my turn.

[01:33:23] Speaker 18: You know collateral damage, it goes into your knee.

[01:33:25] Speaker 28: (laughs)

[01:33:26] Speaker 18: You took an arrow to the knee and you can't be

[01:33:27] Speaker 31: I know, but I want to be an adventurer. Um, five and six.

[01:33:32] Speaker 18: Is your, uh, the creature on your shoulder named, uh, Princess Donut?

[01:33:38] Speaker 29: (laughs)

[01:33:39] Speaker 30: What's that?

[01:33:40] Speaker 29: That's, that's Carl's cat.

[01:33:42] Speaker 18: The cat's name.

[01:33:43] Speaker 29: Which-

[01:33:44] Speaker 18: It's got a longer name than that but-

[01:33:45] Speaker 29: Princess Donut?

[01:33:46] Speaker 18: It's Princess Donut.

[01:33:46] Speaker 29: Princess Donut.

[01:33:47] Speaker 18: His, his ex-girlfriend named her.

[01:33:49] Speaker 29: Yeah.

[01:33:49] Speaker 18: She was a show cat, like, you know dog shows?

[01:33:51] Speaker 29: Yeah.

[01:33:52] Speaker 18: They apparently they have cat shows now.

[01:33:53] Speaker 29: They do have cat shows.

[01:33:53] Speaker 18: Go into flank with you. Make two attacks.

[01:33:56] Speaker 30: This again? What the hell?

[01:33:58] Speaker 29: Champion.

[01:33:59] Speaker 18: 20.

[01:33:59] Speaker 29: Plus flank.

[01:34:00] Speaker 30: That hits.

[01:34:01] Speaker 18: Five points.

[01:34:02] Speaker 30: Okay.

[01:34:04] Speaker 18: And his second attack.

[01:34:05] Speaker 30: She's grown on me, I hate on that.

[01:34:07] Speaker 18: He might have... Well, with flank and might.

[01:34:08] Speaker 29: She, she grows on ya.

[01:34:10] Speaker 18: Um, be an 18 plus flank.

[01:34:12] Speaker 29: Yeah, that would hit.

[01:34:13] Speaker 18: Two points. Other guy is going to move up.

[01:34:17] Speaker 30: I am out of stamina.

[01:34:20] Speaker 18: With you, he's now in flank with you.

[01:34:22] Speaker 29: What does stamina do? Oh.

[01:34:23] Speaker 18: Takes damage before hit points?

[01:34:25] Speaker 29: Right, I forgot. We didn't use it in the other campaign.

[01:34:28] Speaker 28: Yeah, that's one of the kind of things you choose.

[01:34:28] Speaker 18: In the mini campaign that you didn't do.

[01:34:30] Speaker 29: (coughs)

[01:34:31] Speaker 18: If you click on stamina and add the damage, the game will automatically-

[01:34:36] Speaker 29: Roll in-

[01:34:36] Speaker 18: ... roll in the other hit points when needed.

[01:34:38] Speaker 29: Yeah.

[01:34:38] Speaker 18: So you always apply damage to your stamina and it'll do the math.

[01:34:41] Speaker 29: Thank you.

[01:34:41] Speaker 18: What it means is too, is when you take a rest, 10-minute rest, you automatically get all your stamina back.

[01:34:45] Speaker 30: You gotta use a resolve point though.

[01:34:47] Speaker 18: Yeah, you gotta use a resolve point. You have so many of those per day.

[01:34:49] Speaker 29: Uh, x times per day.

[01:34:50] Speaker 30: Yeah.

[01:34:50] Speaker 29: Depending on probably your constitution. I don't know what it is.

[01:34:52] Speaker 1: But if you do healing, healing does not heal stamina. It only heals health damage. So, something to remember if you're healing, it can only he- up to your health damage. You can't go in and start healing stamina too.

[01:35:02] Speaker 18: So if you run out of resolve points, you kind of are...

[01:35:05] Speaker 28: As well.

[01:35:06] Speaker 18: It's to limit the number of times you can recover completely in a single day.

[01:35:09] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[01:35:09] Speaker 18: You have to sleep to get your resolve back.

[01:35:10] Speaker 1: Ideally, it kind of makes it similar to mages.

[01:35:12] Speaker 29: Like short rests from fighting.

[01:35:14] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[01:35:14] Speaker 29: I get the idea.

[01:35:15] Speaker 1: But no, it makes it a little bit more even for the party, so it's so that fighters also have to have a reason to rest now, like mages do. Um, I just... So, um, that's what he does.

[01:35:25] Speaker 18: What did you... Did you, you moved but did, did you attack and miss?

[01:35:28] Speaker 1: He attacked, I don't know what I rolled, so I roll again. I can't remember if I did roll or not, so this will be a 23 plus flank.

[01:35:37] Speaker 18: Just hit two points.

[01:35:40] Speaker 1: The second attack on you, 11 plus flank.

[01:35:46] Speaker 18: Nope.

[01:35:47] Speaker 1: That was his high damage roll.

[01:35:48] Speaker 18: Okay. Next is the orc.

[01:35:51] Speaker 1: Uh, he's always wanted to take on one of your kind. He takes a step up.

[01:35:57] Speaker 29: (laughs)

[01:35:59] Speaker 18: Bring it on, come on.

[01:36:00] Speaker 1: Oh, let's see what he has. He has a weapon. Actually, no. Let's see, I'm trying to remember sweep. Does sweep have to be adjacent enemies?

[01:36:16] Speaker 18: Hmm, no.

[01:36:17] Speaker 1: Or just any enemy that's, that's next to you?

[01:36:20] Speaker 18: I think they have to be adjacent to you.

[01:36:23] Speaker 1: Oh.

[01:36:24] Speaker 18: No, sweep is not... It's not two enemies at once. Sweep is if you make a second attack and the second attack is on a different target, then it gets a bonus.

[01:36:34] Speaker 1: Okay.

[01:36:34] Speaker 18: Yeah.

[01:36:34] Speaker 1: He'll move there 'cause that way he's adjacent to both you guys. He'll make his first attack on you. Uh...Um, he will miss horribly.

[01:36:43] Speaker 8: And then if it's, if, if he's making a different attack on a different one, the second one gets a plus one instead, you know?

[01:36:48] Speaker 1: Okay. He'll... But only if he hits the first time?

[01:36:51] Speaker 8: No.

[01:36:51] Speaker 1: Well, okay. He will make a second attack on you.

[01:36:53] Speaker 8: You just get... You're incentivized to spread your attacks.

[01:36:55] Speaker 13: Yeah, if you already attempted attack is the wording.

[01:36:58] Speaker 8: Yes.

[01:36:58] Speaker 1: So, he knows I never fought an orca like you before. I'll take a swing at you. Big, ugly, scaly ork, and that's also gonna miss.

[01:37:05] Speaker 13: He is so stupid.

[01:37:05] Speaker 1: That's all for his action.

[01:37:06] Speaker 13: He's just... He's so dumb.

[01:37:09] Speaker 1: (laughs) Orcs is not known for their intelligence.

[01:37:11] Speaker 8: It is the- it is the destiny of nature for some creatures to have less.

[01:37:16] Speaker 1: Um, in between rounds, um, he'll... They'll basically both move up-

[01:37:22] Speaker 32: (laughs)

[01:37:23] Speaker 1: ... and start fighting. Some of these guys here won't do anything but-

[01:37:27] Speaker 13: I have three.

[01:37:27] Speaker 1: They'll back you up.

[01:37:29] Speaker 33: Is this a gap in the wall right here?

[01:37:30] Speaker 1: No, it just kind of-

[01:37:31] Speaker 8: There's just walls all the way around.

[01:37:32] Speaker 13: Yeah.

[01:37:32] Speaker 33: Oh, man.

[01:37:34] Speaker 8: Use your imagination.

[01:37:35] Speaker 33: Mm-hmm.

[01:37:35] Speaker 13: Three and four is up next.

[01:37:37] Speaker 1: It is climbable.

[01:37:38] Speaker 8: I mean, it's a high wall. You can't jump over it.

[01:37:39] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[01:37:39] Speaker 8: It's like 10 feet tall or something.

[01:37:40] Speaker 33: Mm-hmm.

[01:37:40] Speaker 1: Yeah, it's about 10... Well, I'd say probably six or seven. It's, it's fairly tolerably taller. But you could climb over it, there are openings. There are spikes and stuff on top to keep you from climbing over but it is doable for a double help. Plus you spend all of your life climbing. Um, anyway, next up.

[01:37:56] Speaker 13: Three and four.

[01:37:57] Speaker 1: Three and four?

[01:37:57] Speaker 8: I think they're dead.

[01:37:58] Speaker 13: Three and four is dead, yeah.

[01:37:59] Speaker 8: Is this one?

[01:38:00] Speaker 1: This three?

[01:38:00] Speaker 8: He's the one in the middle of the-

[01:38:01] Speaker 1: He's the one in the middle. Oh, he's got it. He's got a restrictive environment there. Um, we'll do one, two, three, four.

[01:38:06] Speaker 8: Is the guy who's not fighting providing flank? He is.

[01:38:10] Speaker 1: Oh, he is. Yeah, he would go for the flank.

[01:38:13] Speaker 8: Because he

[01:38:13] Speaker 34: Count.

[01:38:13] Speaker 1: What's that? Um, yeah, he would go for the guy that he's flanking.

[01:38:16] Speaker 8: Mm-hmm.

[01:38:17] Speaker 1: He's smart enough to know that. Actually, it's two guys he's flanking.

[01:38:19] Speaker 8: Two guys.

[01:38:19] Speaker 34: That's not what I meant. I meant the... Our MPC ally is causing flank on number three. Do I get the benefit of the flank?

[01:38:25] Speaker 1: Yeah, I'd say so.

[01:38:26] Speaker 34: He's, he's just a non-combatant.

[01:38:27] Speaker 1: He's, he's fighting them. No, he's fighting them. I'm just not adding him into it for time's sake.

[01:38:30] Speaker 8: But he does threaten him.

[01:38:32] Speaker 1: Yeah. That's probably the reason why they moved there so they could at least provide.

[01:38:35] Speaker 8: Yeah.

[01:38:36] Speaker 1: Um, so he has two, so even and odd. So even and odd. Even, he's going after you. Um, wow, that is a 13 plus flank.

[01:38:48] Speaker 8: Misses.

[01:38:50] Speaker 1: Um, he'll take a second attack at you. Yeah, it's a 12 plus flank.

[01:38:56] Speaker 8: Misses.

[01:38:57] Speaker 1: Um, having missed horribly, he's just going to look at you growl and he's going to try to bite you instead. And that is a one plus flank.

[01:39:04] Speaker 32: (laughs)

[01:39:04] Speaker 1: So that's actually (laughs) probably that's probably negative something plus flank. Um, so he is done.

[01:39:09] Speaker 8: Okay.

[01:39:10] Speaker 1: And I think four is dead.

[01:39:11] Speaker 13: Okay, next is me, Irv is on deck. Um, I'm gonna stare at the ork and be like, "You really should not have come here, partner." I don't know why I'm talking like a Western. I am not maintaining that. (laughs)

[01:39:24] Speaker 1: Um, hey, if I can't do a M- Cockney accent, whatever accent you're going for, I give you grace, but yeah.

[01:39:28] Speaker 13: Um, so I'm gonna do an intimidation check, the coerce or-

[01:39:31] Speaker 1: Oh, oh yeah.

[01:39:32] Speaker 13: ... demoralize.

[01:39:33] Speaker 1: Uh, that is a nat one, so he's probably not very demoralized.

[01:39:36] Speaker 32: Oh.

[01:39:37] Speaker 33: Yeah.

[01:39:38] Speaker 13: Um, so my main attack or first attack, I'll go for number five just to hopefully get rid of some of this annoying flanking. Um, so that is a cool 18 to hit.

[01:39:53] Speaker 1: 18 hits.

[01:39:54] Speaker 13: And that is eight bludgeoning and three spirit.

[01:39:58] Speaker 1: Okay, he goes splat.

[01:40:00] Speaker 13: Good. Uh, second attack. Hmm, I'll go for the little guy. But you were flanking with him, so you'd be more efficient going on that one.

[01:40:14] Speaker 8: He is flanking me, too. I'm fine if you wanna kill him.

[01:40:18] Speaker 13: Yeah, but you're gonna go before him.

[01:40:19] Speaker 8: I'm not gonna attack.

[01:40:20] Speaker 13: Okay, 'cause I wanted to talk about our strategy. Mm.

[01:40:26] Speaker 8: We're not gonna talk about it.

[01:40:28] Speaker 13: He goes odds. Odds, I'm going for the little guy. Uh, yeah, 18 plus stuff. Tw- dirty 20 to hit.

[01:40:38] Speaker 1: Okay, yeah.

[01:40:38] Speaker 13: And 11 on the dice, so that's, uh, 16 bludgeoning and 30 spirit.

[01:40:42] Speaker 8: And that was number three?

[01:40:43] Speaker 13: Yep.

[01:40:44] Speaker 8: Okay, he goes splat. And that is my turn. Flurry of blows on the boss and Matthew's on deck.

[01:40:55] Speaker 1: You're lowest first. Um, that is a 21 and a miss, so-

[01:41:03] Speaker 8: 21 will hit.

[01:41:04] Speaker 1: That is nine points of bludgeoning damage.

[01:41:09] Speaker 13: He only gets six alone?

[01:41:12] Speaker 1: Yep.

[01:41:13] Speaker 13: Get them in the boss.

[01:41:14] Speaker 1: I'm going to, uh, fish for a 20 on a trip attempt on the boss. No, that is a five.

[01:41:24] Speaker 8: Oh.

[01:41:25] Speaker 1: Yeah, not quite.

[01:41:25] Speaker 8: (laughs)

[01:41:26] Speaker 1: Whatever it is, it's plus 10. So unless he's got a minus six on his... Was it reflex for tripping?

[01:41:32] Speaker 8: No, he's pretty good.

[01:41:33] Speaker 1: Or-

[01:41:34] Speaker 8: He's decent at that.

[01:41:34] Speaker 1: But what is re- tripping? Is it reflex or is it, uh, fortitude?

[01:41:38] Speaker 8: Reflex, I'm pretty sure.

[01:41:39] Speaker 1: Um, and my third action is to be defensive.

[01:41:41] Speaker 8: I think tripping was that and I think pushing is for it.

[01:41:44] Speaker 1: Okay. Par- parrying for my third action.

[01:41:47] Speaker 8: Oh, yeah.

[01:41:48] Speaker 13: Matthew, Katie's on deck.

[01:41:51] Speaker 35: Okay. Uh, with my first action, I'm going to cast Sure Strike, which essentially gives me advantage on my next attack roll. And then I'm gonna do needle darts again on the guy in charge. Is there even anything left besides the ork?

[01:42:08] Speaker 1: Yeah, there's one guy.

[01:42:09] Speaker 34: There's six. Yeah.

[01:42:10] Speaker 35: I'm doing the ork.

[01:42:11] Speaker 13: I don't think you have to worry about him.

[01:42:13] Speaker 8: He will, uh, tell the story of what happened here when his family is all wiped out.

[01:42:18] Speaker 1: Well, he's not gonna be able to tell the story because he's going to die here.

[01:42:21] Speaker 35: 15?

[01:42:23] Speaker 1: On the ork?

[01:42:23] Speaker 35: Yep.

[01:42:23] Speaker 1: Uh, no.

[01:42:24] Speaker 35: Ah.

[01:42:25] Speaker 1: He's a bit higher.

[01:42:26] Speaker 35: All right. Well, then that's my whole turn.

[01:42:28] Speaker 1: He has a good proper orcish armor.

[01:42:30] Speaker 8: Who's left?

[01:42:31] Speaker 32: Can I see the ork-

[01:42:33] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[01:42:33] Speaker 32: ... the boss dude from where I'm standing?

[01:42:35] Speaker 1: Yeah, he's gonna have cover because we have

[01:42:37] Speaker 36: There's a... It's a wall way.

[01:42:38] Speaker 32: Mm-hmm.

[01:42:38] Speaker 8: Is she tall enough to see over the wall?

[01:42:39] Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

[01:42:40] Speaker 32: No.

[01:42:40] Speaker 8: Oh, okay.

[01:42:41] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[01:42:42] Speaker 8: I mean, I don't give a mil-

[01:42:43] Speaker 1: Yeah, I can see-

[01:42:44] Speaker 8: I'd say you can see him but he's definitely gonna have cover.

[01:42:47] Speaker 13: Crap, your guys are on deck.

[01:42:48] Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

[01:42:51] Speaker 37: Oh.

[01:43:00] Speaker 38: I'm trying to make... Do I have to do this recall ability ever, for every target?

[01:43:04] Speaker 1: I'll have to look up. For him, you definitely would, 'cause it's... Orcs are different than-

[01:43:09] Speaker 16: Yeah.

[01:43:11] Speaker 1: An orc versus a goblin.

[01:43:14] Speaker 38: Do you sneak attack if you have allies standing, like, threatening nearby?

[01:43:20] Speaker 1: Um, in melee. If... Melee, if you're the opposite side. So, if you move-

[01:43:24] Speaker 16: No. It's not fifth edition rules.

[01:43:26] Speaker 37: Yeah.

[01:43:26] Speaker 38: Okay.

[01:43:27] Speaker 1: So, like, if you, if you wanted to flank him in melee, you'd have to be standing here and have an ally on the other side. If, for... Uh, shooting it's a little bit harder. That's why you have that ability which kind of lets you do it.

[01:43:38] Speaker 38: Yeah.

[01:43:38] Speaker 1: But you have to spend an action to do it. I'd say once you... And Orc may not work since he's played a rogue, but... So is it that once you get that-

[01:43:44] Speaker 16: I mean, I didn't play that one.

[01:43:45] Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

[01:43:45] Speaker 16: I didn't play that, whatever it's called, subclass.

[01:43:47] Speaker 1: But I mean, I th- I would take it that if you pass that once on an orc, like if you pass it on him, then you'd always have it for the rest of the combat, on that orc.

[01:43:56] Speaker 38: Hmm.

[01:43:56] Speaker 1: I'll have to re- I'll have to read the exact ability eventually, to see what it's like.

[01:43:59] Speaker 38: Yeah. I'm gonna do a recall knowledge and then make it. Um, let's see.

[01:44:02] Speaker 16: Yeah. It says that if you recall knowledge, the creature is tha- the- that creature is off-guard until the start of your next turn. You have to do it every turn.

[01:44:10] Speaker 38: Hmm.

[01:44:11] Speaker 16: Um, if you critically succeed, it's for a minute.

[01:44:15] Speaker 1: Oh.

[01:44:15] Speaker 38: Six pl- uh, nature again?

[01:44:18] Speaker 1: Um, orcs are... society.

[01:44:24] Speaker 38: So six plus six.

[01:44:30] Speaker 1: Um, yeah. Well, you got a basic.

[01:44:34] Speaker 38: Okay. Then I'm gonna attack him.

[01:44:36] Speaker 1: And what did you wanna know about him?

[01:44:37] Speaker 38: Oh. What is... What are his strengths?

[01:44:43] Speaker 1: Hmm. You know that he, uh... Or, so strengths would be, he doesn't have any... Let me see.

[01:44:52] Speaker 38: A class with this.

[01:44:59] Speaker 1: He really doesn't have any, um, immunities or, uh, resistances.

[01:45:06] Speaker 38: Hmm. Okay, well, bring it.

[01:45:08] Speaker 16: So, he doesn't have-

[01:45:09] Speaker 1: He has big armor.

[01:45:10] Speaker 16: (laughs)

[01:45:10] Speaker 38: Oh, that probably doesn't hit. That's, uh, eight.

[01:45:16] Speaker 1: No.

[01:45:16] Speaker 38: Mm-mm.

[01:45:16] Speaker 1: It's an eight.

[01:45:17] Speaker 16: Eight? Okay. Well, it'd be eight plus-

[01:45:19] Speaker 38: And that'll roll the two.

[01:45:19] Speaker 16: No.

[01:45:20] Speaker 1: Oh, yeah. (laughs)

[01:45:20] Speaker 16: That's the, that's the, with the bonus.

[01:45:23] Speaker 1: Um, we got a hit.

[01:45:24] Speaker 16: Yeah, yeah. The two on the die just misses.

[01:45:26] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[01:45:27] Speaker 38: Yeah. Okay. Well, that's a 10.

[01:45:29] Speaker 1: He has, uh... Yeah, you got a hero point.

[01:45:33] Speaker 38: I do have... Yeah, you sure?

[01:45:35] Speaker 1: The reason I have a timer set here, so there will be more.

[01:45:37] Speaker 38: It's not lost on me. We'll roll again.

[01:45:38] Speaker 16: Yeah. Shit, so nevermind.

[01:45:40] Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

[01:45:40] Speaker 16: I should've thought about that.

[01:45:41] Speaker 39: I could have re-rode my needle, though.

[01:45:42] Speaker 38: 15.

[01:45:43] Speaker 39: Keep forgetting about that.

[01:45:45] Speaker 1: Uh, 15 with-

[01:45:45] Speaker 38: Plus, um, off guard.

[01:45:47] Speaker 1: Off-guard. Um, still no. He has a pretty decent size armor on.

[01:45:50] Speaker 38: Okay.

[01:45:51] Speaker 1: It goes plink. But it was much better-

[01:45:52] Speaker 39: What's the name of the ability that gives me the plus one?

[01:45:55] Speaker 1: Um, next up. Oh, I think it was my guys.

[01:45:58] Speaker 38: Yeah.

[01:45:58] Speaker 39: Sorry.

[01:45:58] Speaker 1: Nudge, feint.

[01:45:59] Speaker 39: That's right.

[01:46:00] Speaker 38: And they run into where after me?

[01:46:01] Speaker 39: I think the first six, then they work.

[01:46:03] Speaker 38: Maybe one of them-

[01:46:04] Speaker 39: One a day. ... one of them's, no.

[01:46:05] Speaker 1: I think it's like all of them, the two that are left.

[01:46:08] Speaker 16: Little guy and then big guy.

[01:46:09] Speaker 1: He's gonna step... Well, he's gonna make an attack first. He's gonna try his sweep attack again.

[01:46:14] Speaker 39: Technically, six is an initiative before. I won't be there.

[01:46:17] Speaker 1: Oh.

[01:46:17] Speaker 16: Little guy.

[01:46:17] Speaker 1: Um, little guy? Yeah, he will, he will step up in a flank. He'll stare at you. Um, use a scaly orc with a tail. It makes no sense to him but, what does...? You know, he's only a few months old. There could be orcs with tails. You're green, you must be an orc. That is a 14 plus flank.

[01:46:37] Speaker 16: Nope.

[01:46:39] Speaker 1: Um, he was a tough orc with a tail. And-

[01:46:43] Speaker 16: More, uh-

[01:46:45] Speaker 1: And that will probably fail.

[01:46:46] Speaker 16: ... more fail dodgy than tough. Although, also have tough skin with odd-looking scales.

[01:46:52] Speaker 1: Oh, yeah. Yeah, but he's not gonna be able to do it. The big orc guy is gonna go. He's gonna attack you first and turn flank, and he's gonna try to sweep into you. Um, against you first, that would be a 19 plus flank.

[01:47:09] Speaker 16: That hits with flank.

[01:47:11] Speaker 1: Um, oh, he does D8 instead of six. Mm. Um, that's where eight plus two plus four will get you down to.

[01:47:26] Speaker 16: Doesn't matter.

[01:47:27] Speaker 1: So, um, at any rate, that's, uh, 14.

[01:47:31] Speaker 16: I fall over.

[01:47:33] Speaker 1: Oh.

[01:47:34] Speaker 39: Um, I have avenging glory. When an ally becomes dying, I gain 10 HP. And, uh, thought I could make an attack when I did this, but maybe not. But I got 10 HP.

[01:47:45] Speaker 1: Oh. Hey, that's (laughs)... That's always good, 'cause then he's gonna go after you with his, uh, swing, or sweep. And that is gonna miss horribly.

[01:47:57] Speaker 16: Mm-hmm.

[01:47:57] Speaker 1: He's gonna say s-... Um, well, let's see. Does he... He will just make one more attack on you.

[01:48:04] Speaker 39: Um, I think he's happy with where he's at.

[01:48:09] Speaker 1: He'll probably need-

[01:48:09] Speaker 39: Didn't change my initiative to be right before him.

[01:48:11] Speaker 1: That'd be an 18 to hit you.

[01:48:13] Speaker 39: Okay. That would just hit.

[01:48:16] Speaker 1: Um, two plus six would be eight points of damage.

[01:48:23] Speaker 39: Okay. There goes the 10th HP.

[01:48:26] Speaker 1: (laughs) Honestly, that's really good, 'cause I, I played barbarians a lot.

[01:48:30] Speaker 39: Mm-hmm.

[01:48:30] Speaker 1: And that was a big thing with them, is that they just didn't have ways of getting more than 10 HP. As long as you have that.

[01:48:35] Speaker 39: All you needed was to keep dying.

[01:48:37] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[01:48:37] Speaker 39: (laughs)

[01:48:38] Speaker 1: (laughs)

[01:48:39] Speaker 39: Happy to oblige.

[01:48:40] Speaker 1: Mm-mm, mm-mm. Well, that's it for him. They're all gone, so it's up to you guys.

[01:48:45] Speaker 39: Okay. Uh, sorry about that. It's just, it's being weird and not deducting from the 10th HP source.

[01:48:50] Speaker 1: Oh. That's weird.

[01:48:57] Speaker 13: All right, my turn. Uh, I will intimidate that guy. That's cocked.

[01:49:05] Speaker 1: Did you try to intimidate him before?

[01:49:06] Speaker 13: Oh, yes, I did.

[01:49:07] Speaker 40: If he succeeds, he's immune for 24 hours.

[01:49:10] Speaker 13: Yeah.

[01:49:10] Speaker 1: Oh, then I guess

[01:49:10] Speaker 41: So, you can use the 1v1.

[01:49:11] Speaker 40: You gotta change targets every time, e- each time.

[01:49:13] Speaker 13: Okay. Um, I don't know if I would have bothered to intimidate the little guy.

[01:49:17] Speaker 1: You can just take him out.

[01:49:18] Speaker 13: Also, I'm biased because I just rolled a crit. (laughs)

[01:49:21] Speaker 1: (laughs)

[01:49:21] Speaker 13: I want to keep that for the attack roll, but that feels cheating, uh. (laughs) What'd you get? 6?

[01:49:28] Speaker 40: Just do a one hit.

[01:49:28] Speaker 13: Got that one. (laughs) Here's a hero point for you. (laughs) Run you away, you're too wild.

[01:49:35] Speaker 40: Too finicky.

[01:49:36] Speaker 13: Okay, that is an 11 to hit.

[01:49:39] Speaker 1: Ah.

[01:49:39] Speaker 13: Or, well, not 12 due to that, but it's still a one hit.

[01:49:41] Speaker 1: Yeah, that wouldn't hit.

[01:49:43] Speaker 13: All right, second attack. (die thudding) All right, um, yeah, that's only a, another 12 to hit.

[01:49:52] Speaker 1: Oh.

[01:49:52] Speaker 13: What was I going to do with my third attack? Hm, or third. I don't have healing, so err on your own. Uh, yeah, I'll make a third attack, maybe I pick, I'll get a 20. I did not. Um, yeah, that's my turn.

[01:50:09] Speaker 1: Okay, who's up?

[01:50:10] Speaker 13: Next is, uh, Matthew. Katie's on deck.

[01:50:15] Speaker 42: Okay, um. All right, I'm just going to cast needle darts again. (dice thudding) 17.

[01:50:34] Speaker 1: That would miss.

[01:50:35] Speaker 42: All right, um-

[01:50:37] Speaker 1: This guy's got pretty good armor.

[01:50:39] Speaker 42: And then shield.

[01:50:42] Speaker 1: Okay, next up, Katie.

[01:50:47] Speaker 13: Gets five and six are on deck, or does six.

[01:50:51] Speaker 42: Hmm. Um.

[01:51:03] Speaker 1: You're top of the order or bottom of the order?

[01:51:07] Speaker 43: I'm just going to take three shots at him.

[01:51:10] Speaker 1: What do you mean? Oh, 'cause the-

[01:51:12] Speaker 44: Can you reload in between? That's a crossbow.

[01:51:13] Speaker 43: Uh, that's true.

[01:51:14] Speaker 1: So you could choo- or do you reload from last time, so you might have to reload, shoot, reload.

[01:51:18] Speaker 43: Okay, reload, shoot, reload. Yep, that's fair. (die thudding) That was almost a one. 19?

[01:51:27] Speaker 1: Would just miss.

[01:51:28] Speaker 43: Oh. Okay.

[01:51:31] Speaker 1: Rarely enough if you did your recall knowledge thing, I would have been out.

[01:51:33] Speaker 43: Yeah, yeah, it would. Okay.

[01:51:37] Speaker 1: Um, next. I'm just saying, was it?

[01:51:39] Speaker 40: Yes.

[01:51:39] Speaker 1: So, is he the top or bottom of the order?

[01:51:42] Speaker 40: What do you mean by that?

[01:51:42] Speaker 1: The NPCs happen in between.

[01:51:44] Speaker 13: Oh, um-

[01:51:45] Speaker 40: So-

[01:51:45] Speaker 1: They happen in the inner...

[01:51:47] Speaker 13: Yeah, the NPCs would have gone after the orc last time.

[01:51:50] Speaker 1: Oh, okay. Um, I'll just have him move and then the other guys will go. Um, she would make her way around. She'll just dig a... Let's see. He's there. Well, he was in f- was he in front? No, he was side like that.

[01:52:10] Speaker 40: No, he was, yeah.

[01:52:11] Speaker 1: So yeah, she'll take a big sweeping thing to get into his flank. He is going to move up. Um, no, just move up to help try fighting the guy. That's it for them. So now six goes. Six wouldn't know any better. He's going to try to flank her. Takes a few shots at her. Um, I don't know what he can hit. Nope, never before and I don't know when. So, he takes some wild swings which he doesn't stand.

[01:52:43] Speaker 44: It's my turn.

[01:52:45] Speaker 1: Yep.

[01:52:50] Speaker 40: Ah, stable.

[01:52:51] Speaker 1: Stable? Okay.

[01:52:52] Speaker 40: Yeah.

[01:52:55] Speaker 1: Next up. Uh, the orc. Um, he isn't in a target rich environment and he is flanked, but he'll, uh, roll off. He's smart enough to move, um, out of it, so he can attack first. You're beating up more than two NPCs, but yeah, you can do it randomly. He doesn't like being flanked either, so one, he'll, takes a shot at her and it sweeps one of you guys. Um, that was missing horribly. And then he'll swing back to even... Yeah, he will go after you, so his second attack prevails.

[01:53:32] Speaker 13: Yay.

[01:53:32] Speaker 1: Um, does not like being in flank. He's just going to step back to there. That's it for him and he'll growl. Actually, yeah, he'll actually kind of move over.

[01:53:52] Speaker 13: All right, um, my turn. Um, Matthew's on deck. One action to move over 5, 10, 15, 20, so I can get flanking.

[01:54:04] Speaker 1: Okay.

[01:54:05] Speaker 13: Is that flanking or do I have to move there?

[01:54:07] Speaker 1: You'd have to be there, though if you move like that, he will get an attack opportunity himself.

[01:54:11] Speaker 13: Mm. I don't know that I would know that.

[01:54:14] Speaker 1: Yeah, you wouldn't know it until you triggered it.

[01:54:15] Speaker 13: Yeah. So.

[01:54:16] Speaker 1: Um, well, he'll take a swing at you, wouldn't he? (dice thudding) Uh, that would be a 19.

[01:54:25] Speaker 13: Yeah, that hits.

[01:54:26] Speaker 1: Um, 12.

[01:54:29] Speaker 13: Altogether?

[01:54:30] Speaker 1: 12 damage?

[01:54:31] Speaker 13: Yep.

[01:54:31] Speaker 1: I'm down. Oh.

[01:54:32] Speaker 43: Uh-oh.

[01:54:37] Speaker 1: Yeah, Doorkwill then look at you guys and laugh and, you know, "Ha ha ha, you guys' best ones are doomed."

[01:54:44] Speaker 13: Does my initiative move when I go down someone else's turn?

[01:54:46] Speaker 40: Yes. When you go down, your moved to right before the person that knocks you down.

[01:54:49] Speaker 13: Okay, which is why I moved. Yep.

[01:54:51] Speaker 1: Yeah, but like, it was their turn when they did that.

[01:54:54] Speaker 13: But it's, yeah.

[01:54:55] Speaker 1: Okay, Matthew you're up. Katie's next.

[01:54:57] Speaker 43: All righty. Uh, things are looking a little grim with, uh... Is it two of our people down or three?

[01:55:04] Speaker 1: Yeah, two.

[01:55:05] Speaker 43: Two.

[01:55:05] Speaker 40: Wow. Yeah.

[01:55:07] Speaker 45: All right. So I'm gonna start off by, uh, yelling, um, from, to... Knutfig, help!

[01:55:21] Speaker 18: If only I was conscious enough to hear, I would be curious.

[01:55:24] Speaker 45: (laughs) And, um, Katie, since you're conscious, you might briefly see a creature fly out from the woods. It's gonna fly over the enemies and then fly back into the trees. And it is going to apply, uh, a minus one penalty to the AC of the orc until the start of my next turn.

[01:55:51] Speaker 18: Oh. That's good.

[01:55:52] Speaker 45: Yep. And then I'm going to try to cast needle darts.

[01:55:56] Speaker 18: She's a witch!

[01:55:58] Speaker 46: (laughs)

[01:55:58] Speaker 45: On... What? No.

[01:56:00] Speaker 47: No. We don't know that. (laughs)

[01:56:00] Speaker 45: I'm a sorcerer. Stop that.

[01:56:02] Speaker 47: We don't know that.

[01:56:03] Speaker 48: (laughs)

[01:56:04] Speaker 18: She's a witch burn!

[01:56:06] Speaker 45: Uh, on the, uh, the orc. (dice thudding) Great. Uh, 22.

[01:56:12] Speaker 18: That hits.

[01:56:13] Speaker 45: (dice clattering) How's he looking by the way?

[01:56:16] Speaker 18: Um, we'll see after this one here.

[01:56:20] Speaker 45: Your eyes are closed. He's not looking at you.

[01:56:24] Speaker 18: (laughs)

[01:56:24] Speaker 49: My eyes couldn't be opened.

[01:56:26] Speaker 45: Uh, nine.

[01:56:26] Speaker 18: What's that?

[01:56:26] Speaker 45: Nine.

[01:56:26] Speaker 18: Nine's a lot of damage. Yeah. He is still up but he is looking kind of blood. He has a lot of stuff... Well, he had stuff so he... Yeah, that'll do him until it came back to you, so you got bloody. (imitates explosion)

[01:56:37] Speaker 45: All right. Uh, and that is my turn.

[01:56:41] Speaker 49: Katie, (sighs) you might have to move to see him 'cause he's kind of... Yeah, move to there you'll have a clean shot at him.

[01:56:56] Speaker 47: I did.

[01:56:58] Speaker 18: You have to reload.

[01:56:59] Speaker 45: I think she did. Last time she shot, she shot-

[01:57:02] Speaker 18: She reload.

[01:57:02] Speaker 45: Reloaded, shot, reload I thought.

[01:57:03] Speaker 18: Okay.

[01:57:04] Speaker 45: And she... And yeah, 'cause the turn before she ended shooting.

[01:57:06] Speaker 47: (exhales)

[01:57:08] Speaker 18: Crossbows are annoying.

[01:57:10] Speaker 47: Yeah, I'm realizing that.

[01:57:11] Speaker 45: (sighs) Yeah.

[01:57:13] Speaker 46: But if it fits the concept-

[01:57:15] Speaker 45: That's why I use needle darts. (laughs) It's like having a crossbow in many ways.

[01:57:19] Speaker 18: (laughs)

[01:57:19] Speaker 45: Except magic. (laughs)

[01:57:21] Speaker 18: Yeah. Though maybe it's kind of the same thing, like you have two actions before you make one attack. It's two actions-

[01:57:25] Speaker 45: Yeah.

[01:57:25] Speaker 18: ... for you to make one attack.

[01:57:26] Speaker 47: I take it it's an action to put away the crossbow and another action to draw your melee weapons?

[01:57:31] Speaker 45: Um, you can drop your crossbow for free.

[01:57:33] Speaker 18: It is now one action in Remastered to swap.

[01:57:36] Speaker 46: (laughs)

[01:57:37] Speaker 18: Okay.

[01:57:38] Speaker 45: Sweet.

[01:57:38] Speaker 18: 'Cause that was fucking annoying and they changed-

[01:57:40] Speaker 45: Yeah, you didn't have to do the free drop.

[01:57:42] Speaker 18: You used to have to drop and then draw but it is swap (laughs) is now one.

[01:57:47] Speaker 45: So yeah, you could swap and then you could... You didn't finish your other move.

[01:57:53] Speaker 18: You could have moved further. Yeah.

[01:57:54] Speaker 45: Yeah, you could have moved further. So-

[01:57:55] Speaker 47: Yeah, um. Maybe, uh-

[01:57:57] Speaker 45: I mean it's probably going to take you two moves to get to him. What's your movement speed?

[01:58:00] Speaker 47: 30.

[01:58:01] Speaker 45: And you, where were you before? Were you one, six?

[01:58:03] Speaker 18: Two back from there.

[01:58:04] Speaker 47: Uh-

[01:58:05] Speaker 18: You moved two to get there.

[01:58:06] Speaker 47: Yeah.

[01:58:06] Speaker 45: Two so-

[01:58:07] Speaker 47: Five, 10.

[01:58:08] Speaker 45: Move five... Let's see, five, 10, 15, 25, 30. You could get there in one move, so you could swap, get there-

[01:58:18] Speaker 47: And do one-

[01:58:19] Speaker 45: ... and then have one attack. Yeah.

[01:58:20] Speaker 47: Yeah, I'll do that.

[01:58:22] Speaker 45: Um, or actually you could get to there.

[01:58:24] Speaker 18: Yeah, on nine.

[01:58:25] Speaker 47: Yep.

[01:58:26] Speaker 45: I don't think you can get to the flank. So, wherever you want to be, you could be one of those three I'd say.

[01:58:31] Speaker 47: Uh, right in, uh, no, on... Next to him.

[01:58:38] Speaker 45: Right there?

[01:58:38] Speaker 47: Yep.

[01:58:39] Speaker 45: Okay.

[01:58:42] Speaker 47: Do NPCs give-

[01:58:44] Speaker 18: Yes, but there's-

[01:58:46] Speaker 45: Yeah, the other guy on the other side is an enemy.

[01:58:47] Speaker 18: (laughs) He's a bad guy, so no.

[01:58:49] Speaker 47: Um-

[01:58:50] Speaker 45: To get Flank you'd have to get to there and that's gonna be too much.

[01:58:53] Speaker 18: That's 35 to me.

[01:58:53] Speaker 45: Yeah.

[01:58:53] Speaker 18: Excuse me. Stop standing in my space.

[01:58:56] Speaker 45: It would work otherwise because-

[01:58:59] Speaker 47: Uh, I'm gonna-

[01:58:59] Speaker 45: ... he doesn't have any type of opportunity at the moment.

[01:59:01] Speaker 47: I'm gonna, oh well.

[01:59:02] Speaker 45: But...

[01:59:02] Speaker 47: I'm just go- I'm gonna attack. Do you pick one weapon to attack with or do you get both attacks, both weapon attacks?

[01:59:14] Speaker 45: You choose... When you swapped out, you could choose which weapon you wanted to re-arm with.

[01:59:17] Speaker 47: Mm. Okay.

[01:59:23] Speaker 45: He does have a negative one armor too so there's still a chance you can... Good roll.

[01:59:29] Speaker 47: Mm, 19.

[01:59:30] Speaker 45: That'll hit.

[01:59:32] Speaker 47: Okay. (die clattering)

[01:59:37] Speaker 18: That's good damage.

[01:59:38] Speaker 47: Five points damage.

[01:59:39] Speaker 18: Five, I think I hear strength too, or do you not have?

[01:59:44] Speaker 47: Uh, assign deadly in-

[01:59:48] Speaker 18: It's finesse, do you not have dexterity bonus? Doesn't it tell you what your, what your damage is on the character sheet?

[01:59:56] Speaker 47: 1d6.

[01:59:57] Speaker 18: 1d6 plus nothing?

[01:59:58] Speaker 47: Oh.
