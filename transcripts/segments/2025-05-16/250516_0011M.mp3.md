DURATION:3599.869
[00:00:00] Speaker 1: So, I'm not real much. (dramatic music) Oh, what the hell?

[00:00:08] Speaker 2: (laughs)

[00:00:09] Speaker 1: I think not.

[00:00:10] Speaker 3: Wow. That should be okay. (door opening and closing)

[00:00:26] Speaker 1: Thank you. (dramatic music) Oh, we're going from here. Ready?

[00:00:42] Speaker 2: It's, it's downloading the thing, which is taking forever.

[00:00:44] Speaker 1: Okay. Long as you get.

[00:00:44] Speaker 2: Oh, it's almost ready.

[00:00:45] Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, hero points.

[00:00:46] Speaker 2: Yep. I need more. (dice rolling) And the only reason I have this thing tonight is to be the time keeper. All right. What is today?

[00:00:49] Speaker 4: 16th.

[00:00:49] Speaker 1: September 16th, 2025. All right, it is recording. Okay. Our story begins... And any story in Subterra, you know, inevitably does, with a, uh, Norse man getting on a boat. Uh-huh. Just like that. So you're a character and (laughs)-

[00:00:54] Speaker 5: (laughs)

[00:00:55] Speaker 1: ... you guys now know you're gonna play this man. Um, now one thing I'll point out, actually I forgot I should mention this, your guys' characters haven't met. And as I mentioned kind of in the email, you know, there's not gonna be any moment where you're sitting around, you know, com- playing charac- or, you know, going over your characters. This is not, you know, everyone telling me your backstory and everyone what skills you have and whatnot. So, whatever you have, do it through role playing. Um, if you notice someone is hinting at something, like if they have a cane and they're limping, you know, feel free to ask other things about other characters. Um, stuff like that. So you kind of learn more organically about each other. At any rate, you're getting on a boat, um, in Ni. (dramatic music) So, uh, the Norn are from here in Solstheim. Um, you're getting on a boat. And as you're, uh, it's, it's a fairly decent, you know, Norse, uh, Norn trading boat. Um, and you are headed, uh, kind of to this area right here. There's a little Dwarven kind of s- uh, Memphold Daroth is the name of the little port you're trading to. Um, you're headed over there. On the boat, it's mostly Norn. You can tell they're mostly sailors. Um, it's, uh, it's a lot of Norn grain that's being transported. But you do notice one other person that's obviously a passenger. Wait, it looks like that.

[00:03:42] Speaker 4: I should go-

[00:03:43] Speaker 5: Oh, hey. Can you turn them so Irv can see?

[00:03:45] Speaker 2: All right. Well, I guess Irv recognizes that one, possibly. (laughs)

[00:03:49] Speaker 1: Um, here, it might help if I do something like this. Okay, he can't see too much here, but... like that. Make sure we've done it. Maybe, yeah.

[00:04:09] Speaker 5: Pay no attention to the words at the top?

[00:04:11] Speaker 1: Yeah. Only what's, uh... Oh, we have-

[00:04:13] Speaker 4: I can't even read it from here, honestly.

[00:04:15] Speaker 1: (laughs) She has a name. (laughs)

[00:04:17] Speaker 5: Mm-hmm.

[00:04:17] Speaker 1: I guess now you can say anything that you want to. She's like, she's kind of, um, fairly rich. Um, well, well off, is wearing nice armor, has nice swords, rapiers, et cetera. Probably human of, as you're guessing, probably noble line or, uh, of wealth of some sort. Um, you can say anything if you want to, otherwise the boat's just gonna set off and you're gonna make your way to the, uh, Dwarven place. So if you want to say anything to her, this is the opportunity. Um, this is how everyone's coming together, so.

[00:04:50] Speaker 6: Arnor's fairly friendly. He would greet just about everybody, especially if it's gonna be sailing with him, um, introducing himself and, uh, asking if anyone wants to play some dice if they're not otherwise engaged.

[00:05:11] Speaker 1: Oh, yeah. This is, these are hardened sailors. So once, uh, everything's settled down, um, they'll more than likely, you know, um, yeah, definitely take some, uh, place in some dice games. Does your character have provisions or skill in that, or just the type of set?

[00:05:27] Speaker 6: I'm gonna set a dice.

[00:05:27] Speaker 1: I can't remember if, um...

[00:05:30] Speaker 6: And he enjoys it. (laughs)

[00:05:32] Speaker 1: Um, so you do that, you pass the days away. It does take you a few days. This is a Norn boat, so it does have some sails, but it still is gonna take you a few days to get there. Um, you make your way over, uh, and while you're sailing, uh, you... another, uh, member of our... oh, yeah, maybe I should put up miniatures too, as I do this. It's coming from a different direction of our party. Looks like this.

[00:06:02] Speaker 4: All right.

[00:06:03] Speaker 5: (laughs)

[00:06:04] Speaker 4: Is that a person?

[00:06:06] Speaker 1: And-In your case, you're... From the bigger map, Chengdu is kind of this region over here. Um, this is where the Jade Kingdoms are, um, where your character has been slowly winding his way, um, up on his, uh, quest or journey. Um, you've passed through, you see many, uh, things. The Jade Kingdoms is a ton, a bunch of small little kingdoms, but it's very much like China, Japan, Korea. And you get kind of a feel for what that is. The, um... Your character is midway through. You've been joining a trade caravan eventually, 'cause it's, it's a dangerous place still and you don't wanna be by yourself. So, as you're traveling, um, again you're part of a caravan. Mostly, hardened, you know, dedicated mercenaries and, and whatnot. But you do have a gentleman that's also joined you, who looks like that.

[00:06:56] Speaker 7: Oh, god.

[00:06:57] Speaker 8: (coughs)

[00:06:58] Speaker 1: Of a very nice gentleman.

[00:07:01] Speaker 9: Oh.

[00:07:01] Speaker 8: Older gentleman.

[00:07:04] Speaker 1: Um, he is fairly older, um, just like that. You may have eventually learned his name is Lynn. He, he sits there and talks to everyone and he's very personable. Um, he knows... He does have a nice staff just like yours, strangely enough. He's older and he seems like he has a lot of religious charms on him, but you may suspect that... I mean, if you're going to have a staff like that which is used for fighting, you, you suspect he may know how to use it, though he doesn't look like any of the monks that, you know, there were, there are Kung Fu monks you probably met on your journey. He definitely is not like them, though. So, kind of odd, but... Your journey also takes a few weeks. You can talk to them or if there's anything you wanna do.

[00:07:42] Speaker 7: I would occasionally make conversation if, if somebody else initiated it.

[00:07:49] Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

[00:07:49] Speaker 7: But otherwise not.

[00:07:51] Speaker 1: Oh, okay. Um, they'll... They talk and whatnot with you, but generally speaking a lot of the days is pretty much... When you're going through from one city to the next, everyone is like on high alert the entire way. And this is true for all of you guys as you travel throughout this world. Most of your caravans of what I call high alert, even on the high seas. It's still... There's a ton of sea monsters and other stuff that can get you, so it's still kind of a very tense thing. And there's... Really, when you're at night, when you're in a resting place, that's about the only time you have a chance to rest up and, um, recuperate. And that's when many of the social stuff happens. Um, the people will all look at you kind of odd. Um, some of them more so than others. Um, the gentleman here, you can notice, Lynn, at some point, just comes over and, you know, says, "Hi, how are you doing?" He offers you some tea and some other stuff and says, "We don't see many of your kind, uh, coming through here." But, uh-

[00:08:47] Speaker 7: I, I am called Kotal.

[00:08:50] Speaker 1: He says, "Well, well met. Um, I am Lynn. You are on this, uh, journey for sightseeing, I guess?"

[00:08:59] Speaker 7: Uh, hmm. No, we don't. You pick a fun name to pronounce. Uh, Zapotlatena.

[00:09:10] Speaker 1: (laughs) Sorry.

[00:09:11] Speaker 7: Breathe. Zapotlatena's breath ca- carried me here to trace a line carved in stone, a line that ends somewhere beyond. Until I reach it, my journey and yours align.

[00:09:22] Speaker 1: Ah. Well, that should be good. Um, he's a little... He's not entirely sure of your deity off the top of his head, because he's not used to her by that name. Of course, it-

[00:09:30] Speaker 7: Zapotlatena is known to, uh, you, I believe, as Gaia.

[00:09:34] Speaker 1: Oh, yes. Yes. Um, he is... Um, she is indeed one of the, the Buddha, um, maybe one of the higher ones of deities. Um, the, uh, Eastern religion is very much like, um... I think they're called Taoism in this game, but it's very much like, uh, Confucianism and, uh, or maybe it's Confucianism and Buddhism, so she would definitely be a re- uh, deity of the origin. Coincidentally, the names I gave you for those are actually real deities from Mesoamerican. I think that's... I think she was Incan.

[00:10:03] Speaker 7: Oughta figure.

[00:10:04] Speaker 1: She's Incan or Aztec.

[00:10:05] Speaker 7: ChatGPT helped me pronounce it and correctly recognized that it was Aztec sounding.

[00:10:09] Speaker 1: Oh, and by the way, if you wanna look at your particular miniature, that's yours there, and then this. I still haven't... Could you just be a little careful with these? I haven't sealed them yet, so if you have greasy hands or anything... That's not the best seal it looks like. Um, so you continue on your journey. Um, then we get to our next, uh, character who's waiting, um, patiently, impatiently. Um, looks like that. All right.

[00:10:37] Speaker 10: Pretty patiently.

[00:10:38] Speaker 1: (laughs) In the city of, um, the name I cannot... I basically Googled, uh, (laughs) uh, Duergar cities and that's what they came up with. It's actually from, uh, whatchamacallit?

[00:10:53] Speaker 10: Forgotten Realms?

[00:10:54] Speaker 1: Yeah. Menoth-Derith. Derith. Um, you've been waiting there, um, perhaps... Y- yes, it's a newer city, definitely. Now, your homelands are, um, Unek-Melzuen is just right over there. This is basically a small trading hub. Um, if you guys look at the bigger map... Well, we'll get to that in a moment, I suppose, but... But you've been waiting there for a few days since, um... Most of the people there... It's, it's a port, but it's a very, very new port. Probably within the last decade that it's been built. Still letting people move in. It has kind of that Wild West feel to it, where just new buildings are finally being set up. Um, it was fairly well built. It, it has a very nice defensible location. Um, I don't know if your character might... I think your character has some sea knowledge or seafaring background.

[00:11:43] Speaker 10: Yeah, so he would, 'cause he's from an island.

[00:11:45] Speaker 1: All right. So you probably would've... You, you would know that it's, uh, uh, was selected because of its defendability, both from the sea and from land. Though, that doesn't mean it's an easy city to be in. It's, you know, kind of built into the cliffs and whatnot. But it'll be a good port city once it gets, um, fully built. Um, but yeah, it's mostly... The people you have there are mostly traders, some of the families that run it. But you're, you know-You could probably find stuff to keep you busy.

[00:12:13] Speaker 11: Mm-hmm.

[00:12:13] Speaker 1: Um, before too many days, um, happen, uh, come, I don't know how long we're saying you're waiting there, but you do have some troops that, uh, start moving in. Um, eventually you start finding that they are forming a caravan that's gonna be heading east. Um, and, uh, a, a ship sails in, a Norn ship. Um, there is still a little enmity between the Norn-

[00:12:35] Speaker 11: Yeah, I was gonna say. (laughs)

[00:12:37] Speaker 1: Um, they, they do, there's a big grudging respect between the two. Um, they have, um... Now, dwarves are known to hold grudges more than Norn are, but, um, in the decades that followed, uh, basically the Norn and the, uh, the Norn from Solstheim and, um, the dwarves from Uknopan Du Nn, they were, um...

[00:12:59] Speaker 11: (clicks tongue)

[00:12:59] Speaker 1: There was a period known as the Norn Terror or the Norn Raids, which I know some of you guys have given some lore on, where they had, um... The Norn had been raiding everywhere. It was hu- actually cataclysmic wh- for some people. Um, they raided a lot into the Iron Kingdoms in particular, but they also, being a very heavily sea-faring people with the dwarves and the Jade Kingdoms, um, all throughout this entire... I don't have a full map here, but, um, I can pull up maybe. But they raid all throughout the place, that's known as the Norn Terror. Oh, eventually it ends, um, and, but because the Norn had discovered so much stuff and resources, minerals, they'd sailed far and wide, that really spurs a lot of the other races into start, now starting to branch out and explore. But yeah, there's still a little enmity. They're both sailors and they, they, both Norn and Duergar will serve on the same boats, um, 'cause they are both very skilled sailors. And they do trade with each other. But, you know, it's kinda like packers and bears, the... (laughs) And they never go away.

[00:14:01] Speaker 11: Mm-hmm.

[00:14:01] Speaker 1: But you do see, um, a Norn, uh, step off the boat, about so like that. And a human, uh, that looks like that.

[00:14:08] Speaker 11: Mm-hmm.

[00:14:08] Speaker 1: Before too long, you do hear that they also are inquiring about, um, heading east. Or west, yeah, you guys can't go east from where you're at.

[00:14:17] Speaker 11: Mm-hmm.

[00:14:17] Speaker 1: I mean, you could, but that'd be weird.

[00:14:20] Speaker 12: Go to my hometown, maybe? (laughs)

[00:14:22] Speaker 1: (laughs) Your character, by the way, looks like that. Uh, the hammer I didn't quite like and I may replace, but...

[00:14:28] Speaker 11: Yeah. Looks cool.

[00:14:29] Speaker 1: It's an, uh, it's more of a stone hammer, when you think about it.

[00:14:32] Speaker 12: Okay.

[00:14:32] Speaker 1: So, hammer, hammer, Dwarven hammer. But... Yeah, that was one other ones where... otherwise bad, so.

[00:14:43] Speaker 11: Mm-hmm.

[00:14:43] Speaker 1: Um, and then maybe another, after another day or two, a caravan arrives, um, with, uh, two more folks. Um, a Slann and then a gentleman from the, uh, uh, Iron Kingdoms. Or sorry, Jade Kingdoms. And they all, the two are also interested in joining the caravan. So, you guys do see each other and meet each other for the first time as the caravan leader, um, gets you there. Mostly, uh, the people who... Peatan comes and explains, you know, "Hello, welcome, I hear you're gonna be accompanying us. (instrumental music) I know little about you, but, um, you're welcome to join our-"

[00:15:20] Speaker 12: Who's talking? Sorry.

[00:15:20] Speaker 1: "... caravan." This is like the caravan leader.

[00:15:22] Speaker 12: Okay.

[00:15:22] Speaker 1: Doesn't really have a specific name, Red Shirt Number One if you want.

[00:15:26] Speaker 12: Uh-oh.

[00:15:26] Speaker 1: Reddy Sure. Um, but, uh, "We're heading, I understand you are wishing to join our caravan."

[00:15:34] Speaker 12: "Yes, uh, I hear there's good fighting out west. Should be, uh, good time out there."

[00:15:40] Speaker 1: "Ah, yes, well we could definitely use one of your type." You guys all recognize someone, or, well, you recognize him.

[00:15:50] Speaker 12: Mm-hmm.

[00:15:50] Speaker 1: Not personally, but you can see that he's, I'm guessing, by the way he's dressed-

[00:15:55] Speaker 12: He's got some holy symbols on him.

[00:15:56] Speaker 1: Holy symbols and I'm guessing not wearing a lot of clothes?

[00:15:59] Speaker 12: Nope.

[00:16:00] Speaker 1: So for you guys, and this is fairly widespread, um, are pretty fam- have probably seen Dwarven Slayers in your king- in your kingdoms. Probably fairly rarely down by the Slann, but then again, they, they are, they get around.

[00:16:12] Speaker 13: They displayed their scars probably?

[00:16:14] Speaker 1: Yep.

[00:16:15] Speaker 11: Mm-hmm.

[00:16:15] Speaker 1: Um, part of it's like their courage in battle. Um, but yeah, they, every scar tells a story, they show off their fitness, their, you know. Right, so you guys know you're going with a slayer and that's, you know, not, not something to sneeze at. And you can tell from the other dwarves around, they're giving him some deference too. Um, he says, "Yes, I'd be more than glad to have one of your kind join us. Um, indeed, you are quite well-known."

[00:16:43] Speaker 12: "Oh, should be a good time indeed, I bet."

[00:16:48] Speaker 1: He, you know, looks around at the rest of you guys.

[00:16:49] Speaker 13: Hey, they're talking about you?

[00:16:51] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[00:16:51] Speaker 13: Oh, right.

[00:16:53] Speaker 12: I know, it's shocking, right? (laughs)

[00:16:55] Speaker 11: (laughs)

[00:16:57] Speaker 1: Slayers are one of the few, uh, very we- you know, you guys have probably seen them when your cities were in trouble. Yeah, they might have come by. Um, we haven't got to your character yet except for yours because you wouldn't see any slayers where you're from, but we'll get there.

[00:17:11] Speaker 13: Darn.

[00:17:12] Speaker 1: Um, but the rest of you, um, he welcomes and says, "Well, you may, uh, join us. Um, we have a certain deal with, um, those of your kind. You are not a mercenary as such, but, uh, you are not paid by us. But, um, we will give you free passage with us, um, and if we get, um," depending on your, where your, uh, landing you wish to go to, um... He looks around and is really asking, "Where is that, if I might ask?"

[00:17:44] Speaker 12: Hmm.

[00:17:45] Speaker 1: Give him Tegrim's Crossing.

[00:17:48] Speaker 11: Yeah.

[00:17:48] Speaker 14: It's like, I travel to Tegrim's Crossing.

[00:17:51] Speaker 1: Mm, he says, "Is that the rest for you guys?"

[00:17:55] Speaker 12: What a coincidence, stranger.

[00:17:56] Speaker 11: (clears throat)

[00:17:56] Speaker 12: Me as well.

[00:17:59] Speaker 15: I, uh, also head to Tegrim's Crossing for now, and then to parts unknown after potentially, we'll see, wherever the wind blows me.

[00:18:07] Speaker 1: Ah. Well, he says, "Well, um, I will hopefully make it worth your while." Um-I can give you a nominal bit of gold for joining us, at least that far. Uh, everyone who joins us ca- at caravan and pretty much everyone in these lands, it's, um, you know, if you're with us, you're... Essentially it's all hands on deck. Um, if, uh, creatures that we pass along the way, they don't care, they'll slaughter everyone. So either you fight with us or you die. So if you're joining us, as I said, all hands on deck. Um, what I would ask that you do, as you're not my regular mercenary type, um, I would have you, uh, take part in the, uh, rear guard, some of the fi- the re- the ends carts of our caravan, um, protecting the rears as we make our way down the road. And if we get to Tiko's Crossing without any problem, I will try to make it worth your while a little bit. I can at least give you at least five, maybe ten gold for the endeavor. Um, it will take us a few weeks to get there. (dramatic music) Do you have anything further that you require? I would buy it now. Um, otherwise we shall commence here, you know, in the morning, unless the shipments are ready.

[00:19:23] Speaker 16: Let me just look one more time at my gear. I think I've got everything I need.

[00:19:29] Speaker 1: So while you guys are getting, um, ready, um, another character that we have not really talked about yet has arrived at a different spot. It kind of looks like that. Right there. Uh, miniature looks like that. Put that down too. Um-

[00:19:53] Speaker 17: (coughs).

[00:19:54] Speaker 1: By the way if you guys want, since I haven't done any of the sealing on those, if you have any updates or things you wanna change on the miniatures, colors whatnot, let me know because I can still do updates before I, um... We can seal after. You can do it after you seal too but I'm not fully done with the work on those, but-

[00:20:09] Speaker 16: This looks awesome.

[00:20:10] Speaker 1: Some of it is kind of a rush job, but I think they turned out okay, except for the flush on the two humans that I did. Um, it was only okay on that. So at any rate-

[00:20:19] Speaker 16: Look at that muscular back. (laughs)

[00:20:22] Speaker 1: You've probably spent... Um, did you read the stuff I sent you on your character introduction stuff? Or maybe not. Oh, Katie.

[00:20:33] Speaker 18: I-

[00:20:33] Speaker 1: Oh.

[00:20:34] Speaker 18: I did read the character stuff on my back.

[00:20:36] Speaker 1: Oh.

[00:20:37] Speaker 18: Yeah.

[00:20:37] Speaker 1: So you made your way through, now this isn't really on the map. Um, you've kind of come through the mountains, um, the tunnels under the mountains, which are not really tunnels at this point. There's like one cavern beneath the next and they're slowly being built into a general road. There are people who are working on it. Um, a few of the people are willing to escort you, uh, to your... Um, there's a little, uh, in about this area, a-

[00:21:07] Speaker 18: More people of my kind?

[00:21:09] Speaker 1: What's that?

[00:21:10] Speaker 18: More people of my kind?

[00:21:11] Speaker 1: Yep. Um, they'll escort you. There's a little, uh... There's the road there. Uh, basically the tunnels are gonna interconnect with this road. You know it as the, um... Name of the road that I cannot, that I will always forget. I gave it a nice Norn name and I always forget.

[00:21:26] Speaker 18: Neda- Nedavalor trade route.

[00:21:28] Speaker 1: Yeah. Nedavalor trade route is what it's called.

[00:21:32] Speaker 18: Yeah.

[00:21:32] Speaker 1: Nil- Nedavalor, um, as many of you guys know, especially our Norn, it is the Norn name for this little sliver of land from here, you can even sense it has a name right there, um, between, that connects here. There is another trade route to the south of the kingdom. It's an older one, but it's also fraught with a lot of danger. So this one was built as a trader out between these two, particularly between the two dwarves. Actually, here, I can pull up a full map. Um, ba-dum-bum-bum. 1.4, where's the full one? Nope, not 1.4. 1.3. There we go. Like this. There is a, to the south, there is a trade route that connects Shangu to Avonlore which is where the Iron Kingdoms are. And the other dwarves are in this little area right there. Um, and there is a route that passes through here where your character, Earth, had come in. Um, the, uh, Nagashi, the, uh, they were just kind of like a snake-like people with the other people who actually sneak- speak Parseltongue, et cetera. Um, they're in this little area right there. Um, and it kind of goes through there. So there is a southern route. You guys are potentially in the northern route though. So you know the road's being built, it's, you're, this is gonna eventually connect to it which could be a boon to your people, um. But they take you, you've gone out of the tunnels, a few people will take you into a little, uh, caravan serai. Serai? I don't know if I pronounced that right.

[00:22:53] Speaker 18: Mm-hmm.

[00:22:54] Speaker 1: Um, and it's a lovely little empty... It's a fortified area, kind of like a rest stop, um. To a certain degree it's where caravans can rest up overnight with some fairly safe walls and whatnot. Um, it is however inhabited. And as the, uh, you know, your kind, some of the engineers, they, they, you know, got you here in one piece, they don't want to stick around. Um, so you know what I'm saying? Just, just wait here, you'll be fine. Hide, et cetera. But there'll be a caravan coming along in a few days.

[00:23:28] Speaker 17: Sure.

[00:23:28] Speaker 1: I think, sure. They really think there will be. So they leave you there, you know, by yourself and, uh, you know. It's fairly well set up but it's, it's really kind of creepy. There's a lot of, um, like goblin totems and other religious icono- uh, i- iconography all around it. Basically stuff that would scare off goblins and orcs because they're superstitious and stuff. They want, you know, stuff to kind of keep them at bay while you're not here. So what, you can either set up however you want to. I don't know if you have any thoughts on what you would do, being stuck by an, uh, abandoned at this point caravan serai.

[00:24:06] Speaker 18: Um, um, probably not.

[00:24:08] Speaker 1: Find it then.

[00:24:09] Speaker 18: Just leave stuff as is.

[00:24:11] Speaker 1: Oh.

[00:24:12] Speaker 18: Leave all the goblin totems up. (laughs)

[00:24:15] Speaker 1: So you can, um-Yeah, you probably want those up 'cause they are to scare off the goblins locally, so... So, you rest up or you, uh, stay in there. Your guys' caravan sets out the next day. Some of you have gotten everything you wanted to get at this point. Um, and for a few days, you guys travel. Um, it is, um, f- y- no one really communicates much while you're traveling because it's, uh, fairly dangerous. Um, you're constantly on guard. (instrumental music plays) You're constantly watching out. Every time you hear rustling in the jungle, um, or in the forest, um, there you're going, l- most of the road that yous goes through is very, um, fairly jungle, or, h- s- very forest. Um, basically they are just next, the mountain are very forested. As you get closer to the water, you start getting into plains. Um, very grassy plains. Now, the area, the, all you guys would know this, Tigran's Crossing is built on a river. The area, uh, east of Tigran's Crossing is predominantly, um, Orc territory. Orc and I mean Goblins are always not far behind the others there. Um, they are on the other side, well you guys aren't really from there on the other side, so I won't get into that. Kind of a character maybe, but... Um, uh, so you guys travel for a day or two, um, and at one point, you guys are traveling along in their carts and all of a sudden, the carts become attacked. Um, the caravans push through a herd of auroch, which are basically giant, um, they're kind of like bison, wooly bison. Um, they start headbutting the carts as you guys are passing through and trying to knock them over, um, deal damage to them. Most of the caravan's gotten through, but, uh, you know, people are trying to scare them off no matter the cam. And now it's approaching your guys' carts. Um, so, I'll gave, give you guys, three of you guys each, uh, round and you can fill in two rounds. Um, you can pick something you wanna do to try to scare them off. You guys will be seeing these kind of skill checks all throughout the campaign. For these first few sessions, I may give you guys some ideas of things you can do, but then as time goes on it'll be more, you know. You don't have to take what I'm saying obviously, but... So, but you can do a lot of different things. You can look at what your character, you know, skills they have. You could try intimidation to scare them off. You could try strength or melee attacks, maybe poke them with a spear. Um, if you have magic spells you wanna try to do that would have some effect in scaring them. Um, uh, survival if you're trying to, you know, nature of trying to communicate with them. Survival if you're trying to set a trap or something or snare that might, uh, trip them up. So, you have a little bit of, um, latitude with what you wanna do, so... I'll let you think for a second while I grab something here. Never have I put it in the... Ah, here it's waiting. There's a way of traveling, um, and, oh God, yeah, it was over here. Ah. Sure I thought I had nothing over there tonight. No there's some more, oh. Fresh off the printer, mostly. I still have to get it. Maybe I'll get a little bit of a bigger one. So you guys are, in this one, there's a few, kind of a caravan going through. You guys are... I have some stuff I can put in there that you guys can stand on.

[00:27:52] Speaker 19: You saying I'm short?

[00:27:55] Speaker 1: Well, unfortunately, I was hoping that thing would be big enough that I could c- well, you know, draw lines on it and then stand you guys up, but it doesn't fit. Now it is, you guys are traveling in a cart, so bear in mind if you're gonna do any attacks in there. Um, so three of you guys are in there. So Sylvia's... You guys can also, either Sylvia or Lynn will join you in your cart 'cause there's only room for... Well, one will be in the front. So if you guys have any preference on where you want them to stand. I need more... Oh, I forgot money. I'll have to get to that. So one of the mentions, I think forgot the positions if someone is willing to be the treasurer. We will be playing with campaign coins for this, uh, game. We'll get to that here maybe in a little, we'll paused briefly, but... So all coins will be handed out through actual campaign coins. Um, so if someone wants to be the treasurer and take over, you know, trading in and out the gold, we'll get to that, how that works and what we want here. Um, bring this down. Okay, so you guys, for scaring off Orc, what are your guys' thoughts? You guys each have one or two actions. We'll give, we'll start with the first action.

[00:29:15] Speaker 20: Well, if these feisty little critters... And I'll just take a swing with my maul, see if I can get a charge in one to just reconsider attacking us.

[00:29:24] Speaker 1: Oh, yeah. Yep, you can take an attack. Now, any attacks in the carts, things to hit you and things you're hitting back at will all be at a negative one 'cause a cart's kind of bouncy.

[00:29:33] Speaker 20: Mm-hmm.

[00:29:33] Speaker 1: Um, it is hard for both of you to kind of target each other.

[00:29:36] Speaker 20: That makes sense.

[00:29:37] Speaker 1: Yep, if you wanna go ahead and, um, make an attack roll there.

[00:29:41] Speaker 20: I'll take the first one. Okay, that is a 16 with minus one, so.

[00:29:47] Speaker 1: Okay. Um, you cr- crack one on the head. It's, uh, it definitely thinks twice. Um, it wasn't the most solid crack on the head, but you do manage to-

[00:29:55] Speaker 20: Mm-hmm.

[00:29:55] Speaker 1: ... at least land a good blow. You guys?

[00:29:58] Speaker 21: How fast is this caravan moving?

[00:29:59] Speaker 1: I mean, these are wagons.

[00:30:02] Speaker 19: It's not fast.

[00:30:02] Speaker 1: It's, no, it's not super fast, but it's, you definitely would not wanna hop off. You could, um-

[00:30:08] Speaker 19: Why wouldn't I wanna hop off?

[00:30:09] Speaker 22: (laughs)

[00:30:10] Speaker 1: You probably would get trampled, you think if you did it-

[00:30:13] Speaker 19: These are, um, these bison things are surrounding us, or?

[00:30:18] Speaker 1: Yeah, they're all this, like, no, this is, these are, yeah, auroch.

[00:30:21] Speaker 19: Okay, auroch, not orc. Yeah. Like the things from the temple.

[00:30:26] Speaker 7: ... the, the underground temple in Baldur's Gate 3.

[00:30:29] Speaker 1: Oh.

[00:30:29] Speaker 7: And, and Underdark, since you probably never got there 'cause you still have played it.

[00:30:32] Speaker 23: Ah. Such an awesome game.

[00:30:36] Speaker 24: I went to playlist.

[00:30:41] Speaker 1: All right. So these are animals?

[00:30:44] Speaker 7: Yep.

[00:30:45] Speaker 1: Giant bison, wooly bison.

[00:30:47] Speaker 7: Generally not known to be intelligent.

[00:30:49] Speaker 23: Mm.

[00:30:49] Speaker 7: They're just animalistic.

[00:30:51] Speaker 1: Yeah, animalistic. They're-

[00:30:52] Speaker 23: Isaac?

[00:30:53] Speaker 1: ... they're tough. They can be pretty aggressive. Oh, hey friend. Is this your first time seeing an orruck? They're a feisty little bison. They tend to just cram into caravans, trying to get food. You gotta chase 'em away as best you can. You are probably very familiar because they are very common in Solstheim. Okay. So far, you guys have one success against them. I'll give you a chance to... Mm.

[00:31:31] Speaker 23: Uh, I'll make an intimidation check to see if I can, uh...

[00:31:40] Speaker 7: I don't... Oh, do you have the, um... What's that glare ability?

[00:31:47] Speaker 23: Intimidate glare.

[00:31:47] Speaker 1: Intimidating glare?

[00:31:48] Speaker 7: Yeah.

[00:31:48] Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

[00:31:49] Speaker 7: Um, if you don't have that and you can shout at them, I think you'd get a penalty since you don't speak a language with them.

[00:31:54] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[00:31:54] Speaker 7: Um, but you-

[00:31:55] Speaker 1: Uh, I was, I was figuring intimidation as in me shouting and like-

[00:31:57] Speaker 7: Yeah. You can give it a try.

[00:31:59] Speaker 1: ... like, maybe.

[00:31:59] Speaker 7: Um, it's probably there's... It's a little harder since you don't have that ability, but...

[00:32:03] Speaker 23: All right. Sorry. I'm gonna start by using one of my astrology abilities that can, depending on how I roll on this, uh, give me a bonus. And it is actually gonna give me a penalty.

[00:32:17] Speaker 1: Oh.

[00:32:17] Speaker 23: So I rolled a one, so I have a minus one.

[00:32:20] Speaker 7: (laughs) Okay.

[00:32:21] Speaker 23: That's great. And I rolled a two, so...

[00:32:25] Speaker 1: (laughs)

[00:32:26] Speaker 23: I am not particularly intimidating-

[00:32:28] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[00:32:28] Speaker 23: ... apparently.

[00:32:29] Speaker 1: Um, um, you must have started flashing red, which, uh, wasn't the best color to, uh, show them. So yeah, they're, um, starting to headbutt the cart at them, but what's your bonus? Because I might even get crit fail.

[00:32:40] Speaker 23: Uh, probably is.

[00:32:42] Speaker 1: Oh.

[00:32:42] Speaker 23: It's gonna come out to a one total.

[00:32:44] Speaker 1: Okay. Yeah, that would be. So-

[00:32:45] Speaker 23: With the, with the minus one penalty I was under and then rolling a one.

[00:32:49] Speaker 1: Yeah, you have a plus two as well as intimidation.

[00:32:51] Speaker 23: I come out to a two.

[00:32:51] Speaker 1: So...

[00:32:52] Speaker 23: Yeah. It's gonna come-

[00:32:53] Speaker 1: So, unfortunately, yeah, it kind of egged them on a little bit more. Um, apparently your, your horoscope, you know, was, you know, check back later or whatever it is.

[00:33:02] Speaker 25: Oh, snap. Friend, what did you say to them?

[00:33:05] Speaker 1: He spoke Ork and, uh, it, uh-

[00:33:08] Speaker 25: Encouraged them.

[00:33:11] Speaker 7: You must not-

[00:33:11] Speaker 1: He insulted their mother.

[00:33:12] Speaker 7: You must not begrudge nature from doing what is natural.

[00:33:20] Speaker 25: Is it natural to attack a caravan?

[00:33:22] Speaker 24: Just for fun, can I get-

[00:33:23] Speaker 7: Who is to say they aren't attacking?

[00:33:24] Speaker 24: ... a glass of water?

[00:33:24] Speaker 7: They are just acting in their own nature.

[00:33:26] Speaker 1: Um, yeah. Give me a moment here.

[00:33:28] Speaker 7: I will pull the lute off of my back and begin strumming.

[00:33:33] Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

[00:33:33] Speaker 7: A calming tune.

[00:33:36] Speaker 1: You can see how that would work. Yeah.

[00:33:37] Speaker 26: And music can soothe the soul.

[00:33:39] Speaker 7: Calming, calming tune, it is. Well, perhaps it will, um, calm my, my, my traveling partners as well.

[00:33:50] Speaker 1: Is it an actual ability or a-

[00:33:52] Speaker 7: Yes.

[00:33:52] Speaker 1: ... name of a... Is it like a bard-like type song or is it just a-

[00:33:57] Speaker 7: No, it's just a... It's a... It's, it's called the Ashes of Orchard Queen. And it is the story of an orchard keeper's daughter who was crowned after curing a blight only to learn her potion drew life. Or, her potion drew life from the soil itself. It is, um, me- perhaps distracting you because it is an entrancing song.

[00:34:16] Speaker 1: (laughs)

[00:34:17] Speaker 24: (laughs)

[00:34:17] Speaker 7: But hopefully it is also calming this orruck.

[00:34:21] Speaker 1: Go ahead and... That is a seven.

[00:34:28] Speaker 7: Okay. Well, not a crit fail but...

[00:34:32] Speaker 1: (laughs)

[00:34:32] Speaker 7: You guys feel more calm but that actually kind of works against you guys a little bit. So yeah, they do continue headbutting the cart. Eventually it pulls away. They do damage some of the wheels, um.

[00:34:40] Speaker 24: Ow.

[00:34:41] Speaker 7: Incidentally, see? The wheel, it's damaged.

[00:34:43] Speaker 24: Oh.

[00:34:45] Speaker 1: Bad print. I have to fix that.

[00:34:46] Speaker 7: (laughs)

[00:34:47] Speaker 1: Um, they do rough up the cart quite a bit before they, they head off. Um, and you guys pass by their territory. They are very territorial animals and you guys probably went in the middle of their, you know, herd and they just got pissed off at you. So while that's happening, you are, um... They're basically traveling. You're m- standing by yourself in an abandoned, uh, uh, caravan seraphim. And, um, late one of the evenings you start hearing some noises. Um, you look out and you see three little creatures, um, kind of crawled under, uh, into the, uh, into this caravan seraphim. Um, you probably easily recognize them, um, as a type of goblin. Because they're very small. They're maybe only about maybe that big. Um, you probably would initially recognize them as what's generally referred to as a snotling, which is a very, very young goblin. Um, sometimes referred to as a git. Um, and they're snooping around, um, poo- peeking into everything. You think that eventually they will discover you with where they're just wandering poking into things. They'll probably uncover you. So you may have to do something or you could just choose to do nothing. Um, you have a number of things you could do. If you wanted to fight them, wouldn't be too hard. They're minute, you know, like a hit point apiece. Um, but you can decide how you want to do that. You could try to avoid them, you could do things to scare them off, you could talk to them. There's a bunch of different things you could do, so. See what your thoughts are and what you wanna... Actions you want to take.

[00:36:38] Speaker 27: Oh, yeah.

[00:36:39] Speaker 1: Just whatever you wanna do.

[00:36:41] Speaker 28: Oh, I thought this caravan hadn't reached there yet.

[00:36:43] Speaker 1: Oh, no. They haven't yet. You're alone in the Kharan Sarai and you have three little goblins that are wandering around.

[00:36:50] Speaker 28: Oh, great.

[00:36:52] Speaker 1: And like I said, they will eventually discover you with the way they're poking into everything. But you can... You're seeing them but obviously they can't... Haven't seen you yet.

[00:36:58] Speaker 28: But are, are no B- bad ones... Like, they're just mean and will attack anything on sight?

[00:37:03] Speaker 1: You can do a knowledge check if you want. Um, and there's two different knowledge checks. Um, so the way we're gonna handle knowledge checks in this game, too, I'm gonna point out, um, I'm gonna make... Typically I wanna stick to as much of the rules as possible today. I am gonna make one small adjustment to how we do knowledge checks. Um, with knowledge checks, you guys can... I'll probably get it posted somewhere. But I think people didn't do them as often, because you only get like one piece of... And it's generally like one very specific piece of information. So this time if you guys do a knowledge check, if you succeed I'm gen- gonna give you their name and some fluff about them, um, some of their background. Um, then if you... Depending if you get one or two pieces of information, you can say, um, you know, their strengths, which will give you, um... Maybe I'll give you, say, weaknesses. I'm gonna give you all their weaknesses and immunities in one go so it's not just one thing. Um, same thing if you get strengths, I'll give you everything that they're, you know, uh, good against. If you want their special attacks, I'll give you all their special attacks. If you want their combat, uh, viewpoint of them, which is basically like, um, in video games how you would con. I don't know what it's used to... Used to be called. But how... Where they are in relation to you as far as level, you could also ask for that.

[00:38:14] Speaker 28: Okay.

[00:38:14] Speaker 1: I won't tell you exact, but it can give you a good idea.

[00:38:17] Speaker 28: Uh, okay. What kind of nu- roll would this be? I have underworld lore.

[00:38:22] Speaker 1: So there are two different kinds you could roll here. Um, and you can roll both if you want. Um, why don't we start with, um, society, interestingly enough. Society and nature would be the two that you'd need.

[00:38:34] Speaker 28: Well, I'm not trained in nature, so it's-

[00:38:37] Speaker 1: You can still try, I suppose. But-

[00:38:39] Speaker 28: Secret or not secret?

[00:38:41] Speaker 1: Uh, technically it's secret. I'm gonna go pick a card there.

[00:38:44] Speaker 29: (rolls dice) 16 plus 6.

[00:38:48] Speaker 28: Mm-hmm.

[00:38:49] Speaker 1: Okay. For society?

[00:38:51] Speaker 28: Mm-hmm.

[00:38:51] Speaker 1: Um, and then if you wanna go get me the one for nature too. Let's see what you know on that.

[00:38:56] Speaker 28: 15 plus 2.

[00:38:59] Speaker 1: Oh. Weirdly enough, those are both good numbers. Um, I probably shouldn't say that but... Um, one other thing. I'm also... There's not going to be as much secret checks as I think I normally do. Um, only... It's only going to be in cases where you wouldn't know how good you're doing. So with things like picking a lock, I think if you're trained in picking locks, you would know if you're doing good or not. Even things like trying to convince someone, I think you could read their face and tell if you're doing a good job lying to them, or if they're just totally not buying it. I think you'd know, so... Um, okay. So in your case, you know two different things. You know that there are two different types of goblins, basically domesticated and feral. Um, most goblins are feral. Um, there have been, in recent times, goblins that are, um, not quite as feral. They live, um... They've been kind of quasi-domesticated, uh, is the only way to describe them. They're like the classic piezo goblins. Whereas the normal goblins... If you've ever seen Lord of the Rings when the hobbits are kidnapped, that's what most goblins look like. Um, the ones that are domesticated look more like the cute little piezo goblins with the football heads. Um, um, but the, um... You've probably seen some of the domesticated ones in the lands you're from. Um, they are sometimes servants. They tend to just live near by other societies. Some would say leeching, others would say coexisting, offering to do miscellaneous jobs here and there. You don't see them much in your lands because, um, your kind live almost entirely up in the trees. Um, the ground is a very dangerous thing. And goblins, even the domesticated ones, are not good climbers. They're very good burrowers and diggers, and good at running for cover. Not so good in trees, so any time they offer to help your people, they generally just fall out of the tree eventually and die. But, um...

[00:40:41] Speaker 29: (laughs)

[00:40:42] Speaker 1: But, um, you know that, that's, that's one type of goblin. These ones would, uh... From looking at it, look to be feral. You're not... You haven't really seen much b-... I mean, you know they exist. There are goblins in, um, uh, Astoria, but they're typically very... The feral ones are very, um, shy. They keep to themselves. They're the bottom of the food chain and almost everything, um, will attack them. They're known for being very, very vicious. Um, but unfortunately in Astoria, being vicious doesn't matter much, because half the monsters are undead. They don't care if they're vicious, which is why they don't really thrive that much in Astoria.

[00:41:20] Speaker 28: Um, I guess I'm going to just stay there and hide. But if they look like they're gonna attack me, I'm going to... Ready to attack back.

[00:41:36] Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, but eventually they come around. Um, and yeah, they do discover you eventually because they're poking into everything. Once, once a little guy sees you, he starts yelping and raising and standing up. And the other three, other two come over and they start yelping at you. They draw their little bony... I mean, they're, they're daggers, but they're like, you know, that long.

[00:41:53] Speaker 28: Mm-hmm.

[00:41:54] Speaker 1: Um, and yeah, it looks like they're either gonna try to stab you or bite you. So how would you like to deal with them?

[00:42:02] Speaker 28: Uh, I'm gonna attack back first.

[00:42:06] Speaker 1: Okay. You can attack them. So yeah, if you wanna just do an attack roll, we'll just do one for the whole plot. Like I said, they're really easy to kill

[00:42:11] Speaker 30: (rolls dice) Mm. 14 plus... Well, like 19.

[00:42:18] Speaker 1: Well, yeah. 19's more than enough. Um, so yeah, you don't have to roll for the dice. You easily can dispatch them before they get to you.

[00:42:24] Speaker 28: (laughs)

[00:42:25] Speaker 1: Um, so yeah, you manage to kill them off. Um, what do you choose to do? I mean, right now you have three little dead goblins. Um, you also know that vampire, and even dhampir, do drink their blood. Um, it's considered like low quality wine, but, I mean, they will drink it.

[00:42:42] Speaker 28: Loot them. If I'm low on, like don't have all my blood tokens, I would probably drink their blood then.

[00:42:50] Speaker 1: Oh, okay. You can just fill up, yeah.

[00:42:51] Speaker 28: Yeah.

[00:42:52] Speaker 1: They're close enough to your level that-

[00:42:53] Speaker 28: Dispose of the bodies.

[00:42:55] Speaker 1: Oh.

[00:42:55] Speaker 28: And just not leave them in the middle of the camp.

[00:42:58] Speaker 1: (laughs)

[00:42:58] Speaker 28: That's my type of scenario.

[00:43:00] Speaker 1: Did you ever do that? Now you're feeling full. And given your level, yeah you're feeling pretty full up. You're thinking, you know, "Maybe I need to refill for a while." Um, yeah I ordered the blood tokens. I haven't got them yet 'cause they're coming from Europe, so apparently blood tokens are hard to find in the US. Go figure. Uh, or at least the ones I want. So, um, the next day comes, um, your... You know, sun comes up. It isn't too long. It's probably, I'd go with mid-afternoon. Um, in your caravan, right, you hear some noise again and you hear the gate opening and the sounds of horses.

[00:43:38] Speaker 28: Uh, okay. I could... I'm guessing would I know this would be a caravan?

[00:43:45] Speaker 1: Well, as you're... If you look out to take a peek at them, you see, um, humans I suppose mostly, riding horses. Logically, yes you would think it's probably part of a caravan.

[00:43:58] Speaker 28: (laughs)

[00:43:58] Speaker 1: But there could be other... Humans do patrol the road. Um, and this part of the, of the, uh, Theorems Crossing, uh, the Iron, the Jade Kingdoms does have knights and whatnot, as well as some dwarves who will, who do police the road as much as they can. Which isn't much, but...

[00:44:18] Speaker 28: Uh, okay. As... Watch them and if they're coming to camp

[00:44:24] Speaker 31: Um, are you gonna, you gonna try to hide then or...

[00:44:31] Speaker 28: Um, not hide but not like stand in the middle of the road announcing my presence.

[00:44:40] Speaker 31: Oh.

[00:44:40] Speaker 28: How did he do?

[00:44:41] Speaker 1: Um, I mean if you kind of just remain unseen but not hidden. Um, they come into the, into the encampment and they are basically just, they go through a one big circle. They're looking in and everything. (coughs) They would eventually discover you because they are (coughs) trying to make sure the place is empty. But yeah, they notice you. They sh- they... One guy shouts to the other as they come riding up. Well, they're probably just mounted at this point and they come over to see you. Um, um, and run with that, you know, they do kind of have their swords drawn a little bit. Um, they're defensive.

[00:45:14] Speaker 32: If they ask why, just tell them waiting for caravan. Was told caravan could be coming in a few days, so waiting.

[00:45:25] Speaker 1: Um, when would they will sheathe their, their swords once they arrive. Do try to put diplomacy if you want her to see how calming you are to them. Reassure them you're not a threat basically, is all it is.

[00:45:38] Speaker 33: How are the Vampyrs seen in this world?

[00:45:40] Speaker 34: (die rolling)

[00:45:41] Speaker 1: Um, (clears throat) in-

[00:45:43] Speaker 32: Five plus three.

[00:45:44] Speaker 1: Five plus three? Oh. This one you can just, for diplomacy you can just add them together, so eight.

[00:45:49] Speaker 32: Oh. Plus the eight.

[00:45:50] Speaker 1: Um, you're not the most convincing, but, um, they'll eventually, they... Luckily for you, other... This is how other of the Shadow Elves or Grails will join the caravan, so they're not unused... Th- th- it's not unusual to see them here waiting. So, they kind of see it, but, um, it doesn't leave a huge impression on them. Um, for a Vampyr, um, you wouldn't see them as much. There are very few Vampyr... Dwarves are pretty resilient to being bitten. Um, in the Jade Kingdoms there are. Um, also in the Iron Kingdoms there are. Um, a lot of times they tend to be as their own kind of like quasi-nobility. Um, and they do a lot with, uh, um, mercantile stuff. They build, kind of like the vampires, agents outside of the, of Astoria.

[00:46:45] Speaker 33: Mm-hmm.

[00:46:46] Speaker 1: Um, now in their case, most Vampyr don't live in Astoria because they're vampires and, and you know, competing for the same resources. But there is one group that does have some Vamp- Vampyr in Astoria and that is the Gray Elves, because they've been preyed on by the, uh, vampire for a long time. Okay.

[00:47:01] Speaker 33: They're not like the Orcs where we're just like borderline kill on sight or-

[00:47:06] Speaker 1: Oh.

[00:47:07] Speaker 33: ... expect to fight with them?

[00:47:08] Speaker 1: No. Um, Vampyr, um, typically they're almost more of a noble.

[00:47:12] Speaker 33: Okay.

[00:47:12] Speaker 1: And they're... Vampyr can be a different story, but, uh, Vampyr are not, um... See, they're still half alive and generally speaking they fit well into their own societies. They're just kind of the oddballs to a certain degree.

[00:47:25] Speaker 33: Mm-hmm. Cool.

[00:47:27] Speaker 1: So you stay there for a while in the caravan serai. The, uh, you find out that this is the vanguard for the, for the caravan that's coming. Um, basically they scout ahead of the, of the caravan and then they are securing this area. Were there monsters running around and other stuff, they would take care of it. Um, they kind of, I don't want to say ignore you. This is a very surly bunch. Um, all of you guys who've dealt with mercenaries, um, know that mercenaries are not, um, most, um... How do I put this? They're kind of uncouth-

[00:48:01] Speaker 28: (laughs)

[00:48:01] Speaker 1: ... to a certain degree. So yes, while you're there you're hearing a lot of crude talk. And these are mercenaries. This, uh, the Iron Kingdoms itself has kind of gone into this, uh...

[00:48:10] Speaker 28: Those are the same riders or a different group?

[00:48:12] Speaker 1: No, the same ones. They're, they're dressed in kind of almost a, um, renaissance type armor. Um, let me show you some examples here. But, you know, they have the renaissance kind. They are not in like full medieval plate. Um, they're a little bit beyond that period right now. But they're, um... So yes, they have some of the renaissance things like, um, the men have, um... You guys are used to Renaissance type mercenaries.

[00:48:37] Speaker 28: Mm-hmm.

[00:48:37] Speaker 1: They have cod pieces.

[00:48:39] Speaker 28: (coughs)

[00:48:39] Speaker 1: And they're over-exaggerated. Um, there are maybe some ladies with them who do have, um-You know, the, the armor that's like boob armor with exaggerated female parts on it. Um, it's like these are not, um, people you generally want to hang out with unless you like this kind of, um, very crude, like, look of people. So, while you're waiting for the caravan, depending upon how your character feels about it, it might be- you might fit in with them or it might be very uncomfortable having this, this, kind of, people surrounding you. See if I have one.

[00:49:13] Speaker 35: She'd probably just try to stay to herself, wouldn't partake.

[00:49:18] Speaker 1: Oh. Before too long, the rest of you guys arrive, um, your caravan pulls in. Um, the caravan leader would come up, greet you if- when he finds out that you're here to join the, the wagon heading, uh, west. Um, he introduces you to your group and says, "Well, you can join these people here." He makes you the same deal that he offered them. You can help if you help guard the, um, uh...

[00:49:44] Speaker 35: Caravan?

[00:49:45] Speaker 1: Yeah, the, the back part of it, um, he'll, uh, let you, uh, join and probably pay you a little bit when you guys-

[00:49:53] Speaker 35: There?

[00:49:53] Speaker 1: ... get to Teagarden's Crossing.

[00:49:54] Speaker 35: I hope guard your caravan.

[00:49:55] Speaker 1: You can say hello to the rest of the group.

[00:49:58] Speaker 35: Hello.

[00:49:59] Speaker 36: Well met.

[00:50:00] Speaker 7: Hey there.

[00:50:02] Speaker 1: The interesting thing about this is that you'll ask-

[00:50:04] Speaker 35: Okay, so what class, what race are you?

[00:50:05] Speaker 1: I'm a Duragar.

[00:50:06] Speaker 35: What race are you again?

[00:50:07] Speaker 37: Uh, Nord.

[00:50:09] Speaker 35: And you're a lizard. Lizard, dwarf. Okay, got it.

[00:50:14] Speaker 1: The last campaign we had all the really short people. This campaign we have... Well, I mean, it's a very diverse one but we also have two gray-skinned characters which I thought was interesting. Reid, you're lighter gray and you're a little bit darker gray, but I don't say anything to you. I just nod. You can speak Parseltongue and really blow their mind with this one. (laughs) Um, so you guys have a new meet. Um, the rest of the caravan comes in. You guys have had kind of a long hard day on the trail. Um, and just being on alert kind of really sucks. Um, so after a, a while, um, caravan settles in. Um, you're basically at another phase here where they ask you all to help secure... Some of the caravans are setting up their prison for the night, but the head guy comes to you guys and asks, um, if you guys can help secure the, uh, site, uh, for the evening. So once again we'll do skill checks, you guys can each pick something you wanna do. There's a lot of different things you could do here. As I mentioned there's goblin totems that are to help keep the orcs and goblins away. Using religion you could try to, you know, mess with those and enhance them. Um, you can try to use crafting and work on some of the, any of the walls that might have fallen apart or fixing any of the gates. Um, uh, s- uh, survival could be used to set little traps outside the perimeter. Um, nature, if you have an ability to speak to animals maybe through nature you can try to communicate with the animals and get basic thoughts from them on the area. Um, really you can do a lot of different things depending upon what your skills and what not are. So I'll let you think for a second, if you have something let me know.

[00:51:49] Speaker 38: Um, I'd like to use athletics to, like, drive stakes into the ground around the perimeter, just try and form some kind of defensive barrier.

[00:51:57] Speaker 1: Okay, kind of like the, uh, picket, are they pickets or what are they called? The old pikes they used to put out to protect from charges.

[00:52:04] Speaker 38: Yeah, like the wooden stuff that goes that way. I forget what they would do with it.

[00:52:06] Speaker 1: Yeah, you could do that.

[00:52:10] Speaker 7: Uh, 21.

[00:52:11] Speaker 1: Okay, yeah. You get a bunch and you're able to... Now you can't do the entire caravan's right, but you are able to get maybe the entrances where they're coming in and you can definitely get some to make it look, you know, if they're going to try to charge and anything that's right there he's going to try to charge you like those, um, orc, he might have to think twice because it would be a very painful entry for them.

[00:52:28] Speaker 38: Mm-hmm. While I'm doing that, I'm telling a story to, like, some of the other workers helping me. I just end it with, "The ale was flat, the gold was cursed, but damn it I'd do it again."

[00:52:37] Speaker 35: (laughs)

[00:52:38] Speaker 37: I will use religion to make more and... of the goblin totems that were already there in the camp and make more and, like, make them more effective.

[00:52:53] Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, you definitely do that.

[00:52:56] Speaker 35: Uh, wait you... Secret or not?

[00:52:58] Speaker 1: No, this one's going to be secret.

[00:53:01] Speaker 35: 22.

[00:53:01] Speaker 1: 22? Yep, that's good enough. Um, uh, yeah, you're able to do that and improve, even improve some of the stuff that's out there. It looks a little more creepy now as far as the orcs and goblins. You know they're very superstitious. Um, and so it's probably not too hard, you know like the Blair Witch Project with all the creepy stuff in the forest. You know you can do stuff like that that will probably, you know, scare them away a little bit. So you guys have two successes. Watch out.

[00:53:26] Speaker 37: Uh, I like the idea of, of setting up traps using survival so I'll move outside the ring of, um, sharp stakes that he set up, move closer to the edge of the forest. Uh, and start setting up some traps. And, uh, while I'm out there I'll secretly talk to my friend, uh, that nobody else has met yet.

[00:53:47] Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

[00:53:48] Speaker 37: So, uh, but I will roll for the, uh, um, the survival check.

[00:53:53] Speaker 35: Did you say the word familiar?

[00:53:55] Speaker 37: Didn't say anything.

[00:53:56] Speaker 35: Oh, nope.

[00:53:56] Speaker 1: Nope.

[00:53:56] Speaker 37: Didn't say a word. Uh, damn, my rolls are not great today.

[00:54:02] Speaker 1: (laughs)

[00:54:02] Speaker 37: Uh, eight total.

[00:54:04] Speaker 1: Um, up there but not a crit fail. Um, I mean you snap some but you're having a hard time, the wood is too, um, moist still. So you can't... You need it to be just right where it's not going to snap and it's not gonna... You know, whatever vines you're able to find and whatnot is just breaking every time you try to set it so you don't get a, you know, very many sets. But last but not least, uh, Irv, if you...

[00:54:26] Speaker 7: Uh, Kotal would like to, um, also set up snares although he doesn't want to go outside of this, this, the spikes. He's going to try and set up some snares just inside for anyone who makes it past them and design, and they're designed to, like, trip people up, not to maim or hurt them, but-

[00:54:46] Speaker 1: Oh, literally.

[00:54:46] Speaker 7: ... cause them to trip or get tangled to make it easier in case we need to fight them. With survival.

[00:54:52] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[00:54:54] Speaker 39: Uh, crit. Not funny.

[00:54:56] Speaker 1: Okay. Yeah. (laughs)

[00:54:57] Speaker 40: Woo!

[00:54:57] Speaker 1: You used to have some very wicked looking tripwire around the area and it's, it's disguised very well, so... Um, as far as, um, Lin and, uh, Sylvia-

[00:55:10] Speaker 41: (coughs)

[00:55:10] Speaker 1: ... uh, go, they have their own kind of ways about doing it. Um, Lin will eventually, um... He starts spreading incense with his, uh, gets out a, you know, some accouterments that, uh... And you guys have this really nice smelling, (sniffs) burning incense for, um, I suppose Asian incense or whatnot. I really should have put some incense or something on down here but... Um, as he kind of goes through, he says some prayers over the, uh, the area. Um, depending on how religious you are, you don't know if that's effective or not, but he kind of does that. Sylvia, um, also goes through. She spends some of her time, um, she goes with a few of the other workers and, and she kind of oversees them with some of her crafting skills and whatnot, and repairing any of the walls that looked like they were not quite so good but... Um, so time passes. Um, you guys are, um, kind of set up to a watch overnight, so I don't know if you guys have an order you wanna be in or whatnot.

[00:56:16] Speaker 42: I can take first watch.

[00:56:18] Speaker 1: First.

[00:56:19] Speaker 43: I'll go second.

[00:56:19] Speaker 42: Second.

[00:56:20] Speaker 40: How much lighting is in this caravan?

[00:56:22] Speaker 1: I mean, this is a fairly well lit.

[00:56:24] Speaker 40: Mm-hmm.

[00:56:24] Speaker 1: One thing you could have also chosen too is gather sticks instead of torches. But there are some, there is light, um, throughout the night. They're not, um... I mean, though most of these mercenaries and people n- they've done this route a lot. They know how dangerous and they do take... They're prepared with lights and stuff, so...

[00:56:39] Speaker 40: I'll take middle watch.

[00:56:41] Speaker 1: Middle? And that kind of puts you last. Um, so... Okay. Well, the night starts off, um, interestingly enough. Um, you guys are kind of settling in. Your character is, all of a sudden he starts hearing some ruckus coming up. Uh, coming from the back entrance, the area that kind of assigned you to come in.

[00:57:01] Speaker 42: Mm-hmm.

[00:57:02] Speaker 1: Um, you hear some weird little high squeaks. Um, uh, you hear a few trips or something, you know, a few things falling on the ground. Some cursing in this weird language. What languages?

[00:57:15] Speaker 42: Can I do like a recall knowledge to try and identify other languages?

[00:57:18] Speaker 1: Oh, yeah. What languages does everyone speak in it? I don't remember.

[00:57:21] Speaker 39: You told us not to say that out loud.

[00:57:23] Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, that's right. Um-

[00:57:23] Speaker 42: Trick question. (laughs)

[00:57:25] Speaker 1: (laughs) It's a good thing you remembered that. Um, just a second here, because I gotta remember... I can't remember off the top of my head.

[00:57:33] Speaker 39: Probably not the ones they're speaking, is my-

[00:57:35] Speaker 42: Yeah, I can almost guarantee they don't speak languages I know.

[00:57:38] Speaker 39: Common, except it's called something else.

[00:57:41] Speaker 1: I'd say if anyone speaks, I won't... Well-

[00:57:44] Speaker 40: What is this, Goblinish you say?

[00:57:46] Speaker 1: You would recognize it as Goblinish.

[00:57:48] Speaker 40: And...

[00:57:50] Speaker 42: I would probably recognize it then.

[00:57:51] Speaker 1: It's the same speaking that you heard when they were exploring.

[00:57:53] Speaker 40: Mm-hmm.

[00:57:53] Speaker 1: So that's a way, how you're able to put two and two together.

[00:57:55] Speaker 42: Since I fought to see goblins in like my youth, I could probably recognize Goblinish.

[00:57:59] Speaker 1: Yeah, you probably would understand them.

[00:58:00] Speaker 42: Yeah.

[00:58:00] Speaker 39: At the very least.

[00:58:01] Speaker 42: I don't know if I'd understand it, but at least hear it and know it.

[00:58:04] Speaker 39: I know what German sounds like, even though I don't speak or understand German.

[00:58:07] Speaker 1: So at least the very two of you-

[00:58:08] Speaker 39: It's the main language. Like, you recognize the language.

[00:58:11] Speaker 1: I know your character probably-

[00:58:12] Speaker 39: I definitely don't speak it, yeah.

[00:58:13] Speaker 1: By the way, goblins are very much... Especially all throughout this area here, goblins are a real threat. There's some of them in Solstheim and same thing in the areas over there. And d- definitely where they're from. But when you get more to like Hyboria, Aegyptus and Romanis, um, that's more kobolds, are kind of the same thing, the, the bottom feeders that, um...

[00:58:34] Speaker 41: They fill that ecological niche. (laughs)

[00:58:36] Speaker 1: Yeah. In the area you're from, they're not so much over there but there's what's known as skinks. They're small little lizard type creatures, um, that are also a huge, um, nuisance to you, t- in the areas you're from but... So yeah, you, you hear little goblins. You're not sure if they're cursing, um, a few of them you can hear them falling, and then some yelping.

[00:58:59] Speaker 42: Um, I will throw a javelin in their general direction just in terms of intimidating and be like, "Get out of here, you crazies. This ain't no camp for you."

[00:59:09] Speaker 1: Yep, go ahead and... I'll let you, um-

[00:59:12] Speaker 42: Yeah.

[00:59:12] Speaker 1: Yeah, just make a roll just for the hell of it, see how-

[00:59:13] Speaker 42: Yeah, I'm not totally sure if I'm adding intimidation or what.

[00:59:16] Speaker 1: You can do it if you want to, since it's part of that you can roll intimidation if you want.

[00:59:19] Speaker 42: Um, that's a 13.

[00:59:21] Speaker 1: 13. Um, they definitely hear you. You hear a thud, then you hear some yelping and then all of a sudden you hear this, "Oi, what's going on? Wha-" Uh-

[00:59:33] Speaker 42: Is that from back in my camp or-

[00:59:35] Speaker 1: No, it's coming from out there and it's, um-

[00:59:37] Speaker 40: Uh-oh.

[00:59:37] Speaker 1: ... yelping. This appears to be in, um, Common. "What do you thinks you're doing and sending that stuff our ways?"

[00:59:45] Speaker 39: "Well, what you're doing by our camp? We're trying to sleep out here."

[00:59:49] Speaker 1: "Well, no, that's why I was here. You guys, uh, I heard some... Sent me little guys out to explore this area and they come back missing." And it sounds like it's approaching you as-
