DURATION:3599.869
[01:59:59] Speaker 1: Sorry, it's in tiny print.

[02:00:00] Speaker 2: Oh. (laughs)

[02:00:08] Speaker 1: It just says 1d6.

[02:00:10] Speaker 2: Oh. What's your strength modifier? Is it-

[02:00:13] Speaker 3: Uh-

[02:00:13] Speaker 2: What do you have?

[02:00:14] Speaker 4: Or your dex?

[02:00:14] Speaker 1: Dex is plus three.

[02:00:16] Speaker 4: Should be plus three. This, she said it was a finesse weapon.

[02:00:19] Speaker 2: Oh, okay.

[02:00:20] Speaker 1: So eight points damage.

[02:00:21] Speaker 2: Okay, yep. Yeah, that's more than enough.

[02:00:23] Speaker 3: Yay.

[02:00:24] Speaker 4: Don't know why it doesn't say plus three.

[02:00:25] Speaker 1: I don't know why it doesn't say plus three either.

[02:00:27] Speaker 4: Is it a dagger or something?

[02:00:28] Speaker 1: No, it's a rapier. I think-

[02:00:29] Speaker 2: I thought, I thought they only added two, unless they changed things. Did they-

[02:00:32] Speaker 4: Oh, no. That is only a tack bonus. Sorry.

[02:00:33] Speaker 2: It's only a tack bonus, yeah. And if you, if you don't... Oh, it's that time. (game music plays)

[02:00:39] Speaker 4: There's two people. Three people? How many do we need? I have mine, so it's not me.

[02:00:42] Speaker 5: I have mine.

[02:00:43] Speaker 2: Uh, just me and Katie.

[02:00:46] Speaker 4: Uh, two of you.

[02:00:47] Speaker 1: 12.

[02:00:47] Speaker 5: 13.

[02:00:48] Speaker 2: Oh.

[02:00:49] Speaker 5: I'm gonna need this in a second.

[02:00:50] Speaker 3: (laughs)

[02:00:51] Speaker 4: Maybe. All you need to do is roll over 11.

[02:00:54] Speaker 5: Only one rolled an 11.

[02:00:55] Speaker 4: If you rolled an 11, you're stable. It's easier than 15.

[02:00:57] Speaker 2: So you hopped up there and you stabbed him right between the eyes.

[02:01:00] Speaker 1: Yep.

[02:01:01] Speaker 2: Um, let's see. That would've been three, so who's up next?

[02:01:04] Speaker 5: Gets six.

[02:01:05] Speaker 2: Get six. He sees you kill his boss. Um, he's probably not stupid enough to run away.

[02:01:11] Speaker 1: Safe.

[02:01:12] Speaker 2: Now, he's the big orc. He is the big man on campus.

[02:01:15] Speaker 4: He's two months old and he's in charge.

[02:01:17] Speaker 2: Yeah. He's just been promoted, field promotion. He attacks you with a 15.

[02:01:23] Speaker 1: That misses.

[02:01:24] Speaker 2: Yep. Um, he will triumphantly-

[02:01:28] Speaker 4: Go.

[02:01:29] Speaker 2: ... take a second attack as the general.

[02:01:30] Speaker 4: You got this. Keep going, buddy. You got it.

[02:01:32] Speaker 2: He miss. So while he's busy, uh-

[02:01:35] Speaker 4: Third attack, you got it. Oh, you had to step.

[02:01:37] Speaker 2: He had to step, so that's all he can do. Uh, next up.

[02:01:40] Speaker 5: Uh, that would be Irv, who I think is unconscious.

[02:01:43] Speaker 4: I was unconscious, or-

[02:01:43] Speaker 2: He's basically standing on top of you making the Napoleon pose.

[02:01:47] Speaker 6: (laughs)

[02:01:48] Speaker 1: Wow.

[02:01:48] Speaker 4: I'm undoing things until I become conscious again.

[02:01:51] Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.

[02:01:52] Speaker 5: Uh, next is me.

[02:01:52] Speaker 1: Did you make your save?

[02:01:54] Speaker 4: Yeah.

[02:01:54] Speaker 5: That is a six.

[02:01:56] Speaker 4: Two.

[02:01:56] Speaker 5: So I'm dying too.

[02:01:57] Speaker 4: Die two.

[02:01:59] Speaker 1: Yow.

[02:02:00] Speaker 5: And next is Matthew. Katie's on deck. Alrighty. Number six. Now, there is the wall in between you two, so you have to- The orc still around or did we finally kill him?

[02:02:12] Speaker 1: Oh, no. Now he's dead. I killed him.

[02:02:16] Speaker 2: Good.

[02:02:16] Speaker 5: All right then, I will move over here where I can see-

[02:02:22] Speaker 2: Yep, clear shot.

[02:02:23] Speaker 5: ... number six. And I will once again use my new favorite cantrip, needle arts.

[02:02:29] Speaker 2: Is this it? Is this how I go?

[02:02:31] Speaker 4: (laughs)

[02:02:33] Speaker 2: It's, has been a good life, I think.

[02:02:36] Speaker 5: Uh, 15.

[02:02:39] Speaker 2: I wouldn't... Uh, those guys? Actually, never looked at them. That would just, that would hit because of a certain little thing. No, it was the beginning or end of your next turn?

[02:02:48] Speaker 5: The minus one applied to the orc, not to the-

[02:02:51] Speaker 2: Oh, okay.

[02:02:52] Speaker 5: It's a single target situation.

[02:02:53] Speaker 2: Um, that wouldn't miss.

[02:02:55] Speaker 5: Okay.

[02:02:55] Speaker 2: It would have hit with that, though.

[02:02:58] Speaker 5: Oh, I didn't realize the Snotlings had a fif- had higher than 15 for their-

[02:03:03] Speaker 4: Yeah, I'm surprised.

[02:03:04] Speaker 2: Yeah.

[02:03:04] Speaker 5: AC. All right. Uh, well, that is my turn.

[02:03:07] Speaker 2: Katie. You could... Oh, the other guys are here. Um, we'll say they would've gone end of turn. Um, you're really stable. He's gonna... He's gonna walk around and at the very least stabilize you.

[02:03:24] Speaker 1: I'm gonna stab this-

[02:03:25] Speaker 4: Oh!

[02:03:25] Speaker 1: ... guy in front of me and use the flanking that the NPC just-

[02:03:29] Speaker 2: Yep.

[02:03:29] Speaker 1: ... gave me. Okay, thanks.

[02:03:32] Speaker 5: (sighs).

[02:03:38] Speaker 2: Yeah, I was forgetting. It's... You're right. It's, uh...

[02:03:44] Speaker 1: 14.

[02:03:45] Speaker 2: Uh, 14 with flank would hit.

[02:03:48] Speaker 1: Yeah, hit. (dice clattering) Uh, eight points death.

[02:04:01] Speaker 2: Eight points? That's enough.

[02:04:02] Speaker 1: And I will stab him through the throat. (dice clattering)

[02:04:11] Speaker 2: He dies saying something in Goblin to the effect of, "I'll be back." Um, but, uh-

[02:04:16] Speaker 5: "I'll be back."

[02:04:19] Speaker 6: Ouch.

[02:04:19] Speaker 2: "Viva la revolucion," he says, um, in his Napoleonic, and they're all dead.

[02:04:24] Speaker 4: It's, it's Thief that lets you add your dexterity. The Thief racket lets you-

[02:04:30] Speaker 2: Oh.

[02:04:31] Speaker 4: ... add your dexterity to your damage bonus instead of strength. But you're not Thief.

[02:04:35] Speaker 1: And I don't have a strength bonus. My strength is plus zero.

[02:04:38] Speaker 2: Ah.

[02:04:39] Speaker 1: So that explains why. Okay, this makes sense.

[02:04:42] Speaker 2: So they're all done. Um, there's enough people that this, you know, skirmish didn't take too long as f- time-wise, so... By the time everyone else gets out of their tents and comes over, they see you guys. There are some healers in the party, they'll get you guys that are down, up, bring you back by the fire when you can-

[02:04:58] Speaker 4: Once you're unconscious, you kind of wake up on your own after 10 minutes or so.

[02:05:01] Speaker 2: Yeah. But you guys need a full night's sleep in. They're, you know, appreciative that you guys took care of them.

[02:05:08] Speaker 4: Did they... Was there somebody who actually treated wounds for hit points or-

[02:05:12] Speaker 2: Yeah, they'll... There are enough people in the caravan, mercenaries and whatnot, that do that. Though if one of you guys has healing and wants to, uh, med someone who wants to-

[02:05:21] Speaker 4: All I have is, uh, I do have medicine for the old-fashioned crappy treat wounds.

[02:05:25] Speaker 2: I did not have enough gold to buy a healer's kit, so-

[02:05:28] Speaker 4: I did. (laughs) That's why I didn't buy everything in the original-

[02:05:32] Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.

[02:05:32] Speaker 4: ... like, cla- class kit.

[02:05:35] Speaker 5: Oh, just like one or two gold short I think.

[02:05:37] Speaker 4: Yeah.

[02:05:37] Speaker 5: Those kits are expensive.

[02:05:39] Speaker 4: Yes, they are.

[02:05:39] Speaker 2: Yeah. So you guys get a good night's rest in. Um-

[02:05:43] Speaker 5: So we're just at full health? Full b-

[02:05:44] Speaker 2: Yeah, you get, you get a rest. They'll heal you up. You guys are-

[02:05:46] Speaker 4: Do the, do the whatever. Re- rest and prepare to get your daily crap back.

[02:05:50] Speaker 2: Yeah.

[02:05:51] Speaker 5: Get all that experience.

[02:05:51] Speaker 4: Also makes wounded one go away. If you added that.

[02:05:56] Speaker 5: I did.

[02:05:57] Speaker 2: So, you guys rest up for the night.Camp ha-... The caravan packs up the next morning and starts to head out. You travel for another, you know, day or two, nice long days. I mean, it might be... It could be considered fun with the exception at any moment, you could be attacked and horribly stomped. A few times you'll see or hear the ground shake and even in wagons. And you'll see trees in the distance starts, starts to swaying, um, because yeah, there are giants and there are mammoths and there are any host of number of things that would happily stomp at you. Um, with a call-

[02:06:30] Speaker 7: You do know that at some point (laughs) I get the ability to trip things two sizes larger than me?

[02:06:35] Speaker 8: (laughs)

[02:06:36] Speaker 2: (laughs)

[02:06:36] Speaker 7: Hmm, perhaps-

[02:06:37] Speaker 2: Mammoth?

[02:06:37] Speaker 7: ... a mammoth? (laughs)

[02:06:40] Speaker 9: Yeah, maybe.

[02:06:40] Speaker 7: A throwback to an old campaign. (laughs)

[02:06:43] Speaker 2: My character's crowning achievement.

[02:06:45] Speaker 7: In the final battle-

[02:06:46] Speaker 9: You tripped him-

[02:06:46] Speaker 7: ... with the final boss, he tripped a mammoth.

[02:06:49] Speaker 9: (laughs)

[02:06:49] Speaker 2: And the boss was riding the mammoth, so the boss fell off.

[02:06:52] Speaker 7: It was very epic. (laughs)

[02:06:54] Speaker 2: Well, I had to spend everything to do it, but-

[02:06:56] Speaker 7: Yes.

[02:06:56] Speaker 2: This is in Pathfinder one where it's not as-

[02:06:59] Speaker 7: This is one, one E where, like, combat maneuvers were even harder.

[02:07:01] Speaker 2: Yeah.

[02:07:01] Speaker 7: What was that? I don't even remember. There was, like, a separate defense for combat-

[02:07:05] Speaker 2: Yeah.

[02:07:05] Speaker 7: ... maneuver defense.

[02:07:06] Speaker 2: I just spent a ton of feats to even get my insane bonus to do that. But anyway, um, so while you guys, you know, travel, um, it's... But beyond that it's very primeval type forest. This is dense. You... Beyond the road that's been cut through here, you can tell almost none of nature's been really touched, um, beyond any of the monsters or other stuff that comes running through.

[02:07:26] Speaker 8: Oh, we didn't say it, but I assume I would have picked up my javelin before we left camp.

[02:07:31] Speaker 2: Oh, yeah. You guys are able to-

[02:07:31] Speaker 9: Uh, yeah.

[02:07:32] Speaker 2: ... pick up whatever you needed to. Um, so you, um, here. You guys, uh, travel on. Um, after the second day you guys stop and we'll, um... Again, not much time to talk. It was some kinda tense nights. No one's really talking. You don't really get much of an opportunity because you're so focused on that. But you guys get your first chance to get everyone around, is next time you stop at another caravan safari. And you guys, um... It's a little... This one's a little bit more... It's fairly secure, um, and some of the guards are manning all the different outposts. Better doors. And you guys get your first, what we'll call, campfire, um, moment or... And what we do in these throughout the campaign, you get campfires. So basically what it is, is I'll send you guys... As much as we're doing it, I'm trying not to do things... There is gonna be a lot of, like, role placing, like, "What do you wanna do today?" "Well, I'll go talk to this guy or I'll do this or that." Um, since there's gonna be five people, I'm not always gonna have time to go to every one person one at a time, go through what everyone wants to do.

[02:08:27] Speaker 9: Yeah.

[02:08:27] Speaker 2: Um, since there's gonna be five people, I'm not always gonna have time to go to every one person one at a time, go through what everyone wants to do. So I may jot down what you wanna do and then I may email you or in Discord you, probably in PDF form, um, unless you guys prefer Word. Um, a little recap of your conversation. Now, out of... During the week, obviously I don't want you guys to feel like you have to do role playing stuff, you know, when you're not in session. But you can always read it if you want to. But when you come back, um, the main reason I'm sending this stuff is so that you can kind of present to the party as you want to. Like, I always hated during organized play, you know, you roll a dice and the GM says, "Okay, this is what you know," and they tell the entire party. Well, this is what you know. I'd like you to be able, the ability to have to tell, to tell the party. Now, you don't have to, but the intent is that you will find a way to in your own way to communicate that to the party. Um, so this is where you guys can talk, you know, you guys can chat. I'll give you guys a few moments if you want to, you know, read through your notes. I'll try again, I'll try to send them. I'll try to put a date in there so you can kinda go back and, you know, look through. I don't want there to be a ton of stuff, but the intent is, is that you can share your own stuff with the party in a way you would phrase it. It'll give you a little bit more buy-in as opposed to just, you know, I tell you what happened and then the party just hears it and then you just say, "Well, I tell the party what I heard." And that's not really my favorite role play, so. Hopefully there'll be a little bit more buy-in that way too, since you can present it in your own way. So you guys have a campfire moment where you're all sitting around a campfire, you're a little more free. There are, um...

[02:09:49] Speaker 7: When I had been... Kotal has been doing this each night and even when it was tense. He always, before he goes to bed, he finds some time by the campfire to quietly, you know, play a quiet song on his lute. So when this campfire starts, he will have already been sitting there tuning his lute and playing some song, mostly just for himself.

[02:10:10] Speaker 2: Um, Lin will come over. Um, he says, "That is quite lovely, my friend," he says. "Here, here." And he has some tea. He makes some tea by the fire, um, fine, um, flower tea from obviously the, uh, Jade Kingdoms. And, um, if you don't mind, maybe he'll kind of start humming and singing, you know, along to the tune if he can pick it up.

[02:10:32] Speaker 7: Yeah.

[02:10:32] Speaker 2: And then, you know, that kind of... Speaking in the-

[02:10:34] Speaker 7: All of the songs that Kotal sings are-

[02:10:39] Speaker 2: Like all-

[02:10:40] Speaker 7: ... songs with a plot. They're, they're like some, like, ly- lyrical story about, uh, you know, the miller who was a werewolf and because of the full moon and or the, you know, the courting of the maiden by the town, you know, whatever. So they're all, they're all plot-

[02:11:01] Speaker 2: Yeah.

[02:11:01] Speaker 7: There's all, a reason to listen, it's not just music.

[02:11:03] Speaker 2: Well, if you want to, you can always chat GPT a quick tune and we can, we can do that too.

[02:11:08] Speaker 8: (laughs)

[02:11:08] Speaker 2: That's one of the kinda clever things you can do. And it's perfectly fits if you ever want to. So yeah, you're, you, you start doing that thing. Lin usually comes over, he's listening and maybe-

[02:11:16] Speaker 7: I mean, I-

[02:11:17] Speaker 2: ... humming in the background.

[02:11:18] Speaker 7: Kotal is not a virtuoso. Like, if you've heard good musicians, Kotal is just okay.

[02:11:27] Speaker 10: Arnor will join you and from inside his cloak, he'll pull out a small flute and start playing along.

[02:11:35] Speaker 7: More the merrier.

[02:11:37] Speaker 10: He's also not-

[02:11:38] Speaker 7: Al- also because he's not, like, a virtuoso, the songs aren't, like, complex chord patterns.

[02:11:44] Speaker 8: (laughs)

[02:11:45] Speaker 7: They're very easy to join into-

[02:11:46] Speaker 2: It's pop chords. (laughs)

[02:11:48] Speaker 7: One, four, five, four, one. (laughs)

[02:11:50] Speaker 10: Yeah, and Arnor is not particularly great either, but, uh-

[02:11:53] Speaker 7: No. It's-

[02:11:55] Speaker 10: He joins in.

[02:11:59] Speaker 9: Yeah, I think Broldan would be around the campfire at some point to enjoy the songs and listen and maybe talk-

[02:12:06] Speaker 7: It's just a way for, it's a way for... He'll so- after a song is over, he'll say, "Thank you, my friends. I like to play to relax. Hopefully it provides some relaxation to others as well."

[02:12:21] Speaker 2: Um, Sylvia at some point has come over as well to join you guys at the campfire. You guys were there when Lynn's there. All right, there you are.

[02:12:32] Speaker 11: Oh.

[02:12:32] Speaker 2: There's you guys around the campfire. And she'll come and do um, you know, "You guys had fought well. So have you. I, um, had heard the prowess of, of the Duergar. I had, had never seen you in action, however."

[02:12:49] Speaker 12: Yes, it's, it's always fun to serve Grummel in my own way.

[02:12:56] Speaker 13: Grummel? Is that his name?

[02:12:57] Speaker 12: I can't remember the name off the top of my head.

[02:13:02] Speaker 13: Ah.

[02:13:04] Speaker 12: It's another slayer god.

[02:13:05] Speaker 13: Yeah. Something with a G. Uh, it's always good to serve Grummel and fight to the best of my ability.

[02:13:14] Speaker 2: And she'd say, "Have you... Your, your kind is well known. Um, we would have slayer cults come through our area when I was kid and they, they, uh, they killed some, uh, trolls." And she tells both of you a little story.

[02:13:30] Speaker 13: From here.

[02:13:31] Speaker 2: Oh, yep, that's right. Um, she says, "Yeah, they had killed some trolls, um, when I was a kid, so I've, uh, admittedly there's always been a great fascination among some of my cousins with, uh, slayer types."

[02:13:44] Speaker 13: Mm. "Yes, I once killed a troll myself. One of my arms was tied behind my back, but I had my hand in a beard and I wrapped it around its neck and strangled it as much as I could." (sighs) "My friends call me A Vicious Beard indeed."

[02:14:02] Speaker 2: (laughs) Well, she would, um, that could be your character's, you know, um, story, or of a vicious beer, perhaps.

[02:14:14] Speaker 13: Oh, please, my friends call me Broc.

[02:14:17] Speaker 2: Oh, that's right, obviously.

[02:14:18] Speaker 12: (laughs)

[02:14:18] Speaker 2: Um, I'm gonna... It's gonna go well for one of guys' characters named Tooby for myself, so, I'll probably get it wrong. Um, but yeah, you know, she kind of chitchats with some of you guys about that. Um, and if you guys would... No, you're good. Um, yeah, and all, the rest of you guys are free to talk. You guys haven't really introduced each other's names, so... Um, but she would introduce herself as Sylvia. Um, last name is Mournhold. Wouldn't probably mean anything to any of you guys, but... Um, he says, "I'm Lynn, Lynn Chong. Um, from..." He goes through a specific, uh, area that he's from in the Jade Kingdoms. You guys can-

[02:14:57] Speaker 14: Oh, Aurelia.

[02:14:58] Speaker 12: What was that?

[02:15:00] Speaker 14: Aurelia.

[02:15:01] Speaker 12: Aurelia. Okay.

[02:15:03] Speaker 2: You know, they'd say, "Well met." Uh, you've come from over the mountains. They, they will, they will... I think both of them would recognize you, um, as, uh... Um, Grails are, are well enough known, um, to both of the NPCs at least. Yeah.

[02:15:25] Speaker 13: You already know me. I've introduced myself. Uh, Ralden Grimstone. But my friends, and I do count you among my friends now, they call me Broc.

[02:15:36] Speaker 2: Oh, and they say, "Well met." Um, "And you our quiet friend?"

[02:15:41] Speaker 7: Uh-huh. I am called Kotal. I was, uh, born where the air tastes of copper and orchids in a monastery that teaches pupils to hear, you would call, or Gaia, to hear Gaia's every sigh. I, uh, there I swept courtyards and sparred with the reeves, and learned this, that a single true breath can steady both heart and hand. When my questions outnumbered the answers I was receiving, the elders pressed this staff into my palm and told me to walk until I understood why w- wind must wander.

[02:16:25] Speaker 2: Um, Lynn seems particularly receptive to that. And she says, "Ah, that is, um, very eloquently put. You speak with such a, a poetic tongue. I have, um, seen very few of your, your kind, and many of my people even less, but hopefully we shall learn more of you."

[02:16:44] Speaker 7: Perhaps we will travel together longer.

[02:16:48] Speaker 2: Yes, we are all luckily headed to, uh, Tigran's Crossing, so, um, maybe fortuitous for us to have met here. Just, like, one seat that's, you know... 'Cause yes, like, you see the, the, the several characters on a computer game and one character's missing that you know you're gonna meet someday, so... Sitting around the campfire, there's a conspicuously empty camp seat, but...

[02:17:11] Speaker 12: (laughs) What is the shape of the seat?

[02:17:14] Speaker 2: (laughs)

[02:17:14] Speaker 14: (laughs) Uh, I would've probably, like, pu- pulled out, you know, like, the origami paper. She would've probably, like, pulled out a stack of origami paper and just, like, started making, like, origami birds, origami, like, snakes, just, like, little animals. Just sitting there, breath fire.

[02:17:39] Speaker 2: Um, yeah, they would probably... I mean, these, these two NPCs would probably be pretty interested in that, um, your skill or how you got it. Just a hobby or pastime.

[02:17:48] Speaker 14: Yeah.

[02:17:50] Speaker 2: Yeah, I think that's quite interesting. And, yeah, you probably don't see a lot of people that can do that.

[02:17:55] Speaker 14: Yeah.

[02:17:59] Speaker 2: And then last but not least, they might look at you and say, "Well, our Norn friend."

[02:18:05] Speaker 15: Uh, our Norn, if he, if we're no longer playing, uh, music at this point, would actually be knitting.

[02:18:12] Speaker 2: Oh, that is quite-

[02:18:13] Speaker 14: What are you making?

[02:18:14] Speaker 15: A scarf. He's just knitting the net. Ah, yes.

[02:18:25] Speaker 16: I'm Arnor Josefsson (laughs) of Solstheim. Looking for my fortune, wandering the world. Looking for, forward to seeing Tegrim's Crossing at this point in my life.

[02:18:42] Speaker 2: Ah, well. It is perhaps fortuitous that we would have both a Norn and, um-

[02:18:49] Speaker 17: Durgar.

[02:18:50] Speaker 2: ... a Durgar, um, joining us here. Um, as well as another from over the mountain, um, and then one from across the sea.

[02:18:58] Speaker 16: "Fate can be a interesting thing," I say as I continue knitting. (laughs)

[02:19:06] Speaker 13: My Norn friend, I hold no grudges against the Norn raids. I hope you hold none against the Durgar.

[02:19:11] Speaker 16: "Never found a reason to hold grudges. Fate weaves as it wills."

[02:19:21] Speaker 2: So, you guys have a chance to sit there and chit chat with each other for a while, if there's anything you wanna, you know... Outside of that, the night will just pass along. Um, and you can sit there and play music and whatnot, it's always a welcome thing. Um, you know, in older times, yeah, people who could play an instrument, even if you weren't good at it, it was still highly appreciated 'cause generally speaking, you may only hear music once every few days, perhaps.

[02:19:45] Speaker 7: I have found in my travels that oftentimes the offer to play a bit of music in the tavern common room will pay for my meal and my room in small tavern, which as you say, has not been, has not heard music in sometime.

[02:20:03] Speaker 16: Skalds are always appreciated in Solstheim.

[02:20:10] Speaker 2: So appreciative of your language as skalds

[02:20:11] Speaker 18: (laughs)

[02:20:11] Speaker 2: ... come among. Um, so yeah. I mean, if you guys have anything you wanna say or whatnot, otherwise we're gonna pass the night.

[02:20:22] Speaker 7: Meaning, Kotal is, Kotal's personality appears to be the person who doesn't start conversations, so he would mostly stay. Listen carefully to what people are saying, but he will not... He's not a extrovert, as you might, as one might say. So-

[02:20:47] Speaker 19: I was kind of thinking the same.

[02:20:49] Speaker 7: But he would, uh, he would note that he has more information to share if only someone would ask, yeah (laughs)

[02:20:58] Speaker 16: (laughs) Arnor is quite e- extroverted.

[02:21:00] Speaker 2: Mm.

[02:21:01] Speaker 16: Well-

[02:21:02] Speaker 7: Perhaps Arnor would say, "What? So why the hell are you going to Tegrim's Crossing?" (laughs)

[02:21:07] Speaker 19: He really is kind of shy, but like, if people start talking to her, she'll, like, engage in conversation, but yeah, she doesn't really like to start-

[02:21:16] Speaker 7: Arnor.

[02:21:16] Speaker 19: ... conversations.

[02:21:17] Speaker 7: "Why are you going to Tegrim's Crossing?" (laughs)

[02:21:20] Speaker 16: Ah, wandering the world.

[02:21:23] Speaker 7: Ah.

[02:21:23] Speaker 16: Looking forward to seeing it. Seeing what business I can find there.

[02:21:30] Speaker 7: The wanderlust took you?

[02:21:32] Speaker 16: It affects many of us at some point in our lives.

[02:21:35] Speaker 7: Indeed.

[02:21:36] Speaker 16: Me a bit later than some, but hey.

[02:21:38] Speaker 7: I am 250 years old, but we still-

[02:21:41] Speaker 16: (laughs)

[02:21:41] Speaker 7: ... are very sprightly in our youths, aren't we?

[02:21:44] Speaker 16: Aye. Aye. So, my friends, we fought together in arms against the orc and the goblins. What did we do well? What can we improve next time?

[02:22:00] Speaker 13: Like to not miss my attacks.

[02:22:02] Speaker 16: (laughs)

[02:22:03] Speaker 17: (laughs)

[02:22:04] Speaker 19: Don't fall down.

[02:22:05] Speaker 13: Yes, that too.

[02:22:08] Speaker 7: Must be less rash.

[02:22:16] Speaker 19: Why are you going into-

[02:22:17] Speaker 7: More balance.

[02:22:18] Speaker 19: ... Tegrim's Crossing.

[02:22:19] Speaker 2: Mm.

[02:22:20] Speaker 13: Oh, the thrill of battle, adventure. I am a dwarven slayer. We seek battle that's a good depth-

[02:22:28] Speaker 17: (laughs)

[02:22:28] Speaker 13: ... to the end of our journeys. I hear there is much battle there. I look forward to fighting and someday dying in that battle.

[02:22:38] Speaker 16: A good death.

[02:22:39] Speaker 13: Indeed.

[02:22:40] Speaker 16: Worthy of, uh...

[02:22:44] Speaker 13: Durnir?

[02:22:45] Speaker 16: Yeah. I don't remember what we were calling it.

[02:22:52] Speaker 2: What about you? (laughs)

[02:22:55] Speaker 17: (laughs)

[02:22:56] Speaker 16: (laughs)

[02:22:57] Speaker 13: What are you doing at Tegrim's Crossing?

[02:23:00] Speaker 19: Uh, investigating.

[02:23:04] Speaker 16: Investigating?

[02:23:05] Speaker 19: Mm-hmm.

[02:23:06] Speaker 16: An investigator, are you?

[02:23:08] Speaker 19: Mm-hmm.

[02:23:10] Speaker 16: Mm. It's a noble profession.

[02:23:12] Speaker 19: Looking into something for a friend.

[02:23:17] Speaker 13: Well, perhaps if we continue journeying together, we may be able to uncover that. I'd be happy to assist you. (laughs)

[02:23:25] Speaker 19: Possibly.

[02:23:30] Speaker 16: And our scaly friend.

[02:23:32] Speaker 2: (laughs)

[02:23:32] Speaker 17: (laughs)

[02:23:32] Speaker 7: (laughs)

[02:23:32] Speaker 13: (laughs)

[02:23:32] Speaker 16: (laughs)

[02:23:36] Speaker 2: You know, he was always preparing it.

[02:23:37] Speaker 16: What is it that you are seeking in Tegrim's Crossing?

[02:23:39] Speaker 7: I have an answer.

[02:23:42] Speaker 2: (laughs)

[02:23:44] Speaker 7: A moss, a moss-eaten carving of a warrior clutching a broken blade lodged itself in my thoughts and has not been willing to let go. I am following its scattered echoes and I believe that the whispers hint that the broken sword's, uh, story ends somewhere beyond these hills. Whether it ends in ash or in blossom, I intend to see it firsthand.

[02:24:11] Speaker 16: Fascinating. Hm.

[02:24:14] Speaker 19: (laughs)

[02:24:16] Speaker 13: Is this a vision you had or an artifact you've stumbled across that's led you on this quest?

[02:24:21] Speaker 7: It was an ancient rune in my homeland. Of a dwarven warrior with a broken we- we- we- weapon. And some cryptic runes, which led me here.

[02:24:41] Speaker 20: I think, uh, Roldan gets a little quiet at that.

[02:24:51] Speaker 2: I'll have to now, see if I can find you a photo of the shit I'd seen. Um, yeah, I mean, and the rest are kind of interested. Um, he will, um... (clears throat) As far as like the NPCs, uh, Lin eventually says to us, "Well, I am very pleased to be in the, uh, p- party of such, uh, uh, companions. Uh, I am seeking, uh, Tigran's Crossing. Um, the, uh, Jade Kingdoms had helped build the road up until Tigran's Crossing and, uh, there were rumors of, um... They had been taking, uh..." Some of the different kingdoms have been out here, uh, for a while, taking little expeditions. The rumors fly that there is this, uh, shrine of, uh, um, great healing and, uh, divine power, um. Has to be a very oriental one, but y- you know, shrine, but... "Um, so I wish to go out and maybe, uh, see the land for myself, um, and set up... I am older in age, not really so much to adventure, but, um, I heard when Tigran's Crossing was built, there were... So my kind had been here and had set up an old, uh, shrine." This, uh, the shrine in this case would have been a very, uh, um, oriental, um, Buddhist type shrine, but... "Um, have any of you guys ever been to a Buddhist monastery?"

[02:26:13] Speaker 21: Yes.

[02:26:13] Speaker 2: Yeah. You get kind of, you'll get kind of the feel for what he's referring to when he talks about these kinds of places. "I've heard it has long been abandoned and disrepair, so, um, I'd perhaps get, fix this up myself." Sylvia will just kind of roll her eyes. Um, as far as she's sitting, she's sitting, you know, um, very, you know, like, uh, you assume like a noble would sit, very straight, incredibly good posture and whatnot. Uh, she just comments, um, "I'm just here on family business. Um, my, uh, eh, our family has, uh, ties, um, d- an interest in improving our trade. So I'm going to each crossing to see to that." Um, she s- sighs, and you guys kind of tell there's a little bit of unease. And she says, "Well, I should say, I was voluntold, uh, to go here and-"

[02:27:15] Speaker 22: Family drama.

[02:27:16] Speaker 2: "... see to our..." She says, "We are more or less, I'm not the eldest. My older brothers and sisters will inherit the family fortune. Um, it is my duty to, um, see to the family's duties, uh, perhaps our future, um, in these lands." So to Tigran's Crossing I go. (dramatic music) And with that, the night just continues with some general chit-chatting and, and whatnot. Um, you guys take off the next morning, um, the cold caravan lurches. You know you're still a good decent ways away at this point still. Getting from where you're going and crossing, you know, from the dwarven place to Tigran's Crossing, that's still gonna, it's like several weeks. These roads are nice. They're dwarven built roads, but still, um, it's a bumpy, fairly slow ride. You can't just charge your horses all the time. Um, you make your way, um, throughout the next few days. Um, and really it's uneventful, uh, not that it's peaceful. I mean, it's nothing in this world really is, but, um, you make your way a bit further. Um, you're on the road the next day, and all of a sudden you're in the caravan in your carts, and you hear some shouting coming, um, from down the line. And all of a sudden you notice that the caravan is picking up speed.

[02:28:43] Speaker 20: From ahead?

[02:28:44] Speaker 2: Yep. And then word gets passed along, kind of telephone style. Um, a lot of it's-

[02:28:51] Speaker 22: Hear it in the night time.

[02:28:51] Speaker 2: ... not accurate, you know, peop- purple monkey eating grapes. Um, you know what that means, but eventually you figure out that they're under attack. Um, and I'll let you go ahead and roll initiative while I get this set up.

[02:29:04] Speaker 20: Ancestors.

[02:29:10] Speaker 22: I'm not sneaking.

[02:29:15] Speaker 2: Yeah, you'd probably be able to in the carts 'cause you're riding in carts this time.

[02:29:19] Speaker 22: My perception is actually better than my stealth, so.

[02:29:23] Speaker 2: Yeah, later on once you start... I think rogues have a good perception. I think once you start taking like, if you specialize in stealth, then it becomes worth doing a little bit more. Arnor.

[02:29:44] Speaker 21: 24.

[02:29:47] Speaker 20: Hey. Trying to remember people's names as I do this. Arilla.

[02:29:54] Speaker 2: Aurelia.

[02:29:55] Speaker 22: Uh, 11.

[02:29:56] Speaker 20: 11.

[02:29:58] Speaker 2: Kotar.

[02:30:00] Speaker 23: Seven.

[02:30:01] Speaker 2: Now which cart do you guys wanna be in? I'll give you guys... There's basically two. You can spread yourselves out however you wish, and the NPCs will follow up with whatever...

[02:30:09] Speaker 20: Front cart for Kotal.

[02:30:15] Speaker 2: Aurelia?

[02:30:17] Speaker 22: Mm-hmm.

[02:30:18] Speaker 2: Aurelia, which cart did you wanna be in?

[02:30:22] Speaker 22: Hmm, the back one.

[02:30:23] Speaker 2: Back one.

[02:30:25] Speaker 22: To A, keep watch behind us, and B...

[02:30:29] Speaker 2: Okay, your guy.

[02:30:30] Speaker 21: Uh, I guess the front one.

[02:30:31] Speaker 2: Front one.

[02:30:33] Speaker 21: Well, so that we're split up two and two, I guess I'll take the back one.

[02:30:36] Speaker 2: Okay, and then the two NPCs will join you in the back. Yeah.

[02:30:39] Speaker 20: Seems more, more room back there.

[02:30:41] Speaker 2: Yeah, bigger cart just by...I gotta go through and print up a few more. Just, I mean it's, obviously caravans are gonna be playing a part in this campaign, so we need more wagons. Kent has one I painted up for him. Hold on.

[02:30:55] Speaker 24: Let's just say I'm sure you have more wagons, right?

[02:30:58] Speaker 2: Not now, but-

[02:30:59] Speaker 24: Oh.

[02:30:59] Speaker 2: ... they will.

[02:31:00] Speaker 25: But he's got a miniature factory over there.

[02:31:03] Speaker 24: Yeah, it's true. He does.

[02:31:05] Speaker 2: So yeah, print two of those, but I gotta, uh, adjust the STLs 'cause they

[02:31:08] Speaker 26: Yeah.

[02:31:08] Speaker 2: ... different. So it's not too long, and all of a sudden you guys start hearing yelping. And you realize this is goblins.

[02:31:15] Speaker 24: Wow. We out-piled them to the back here, didn't we?

[02:31:18] Speaker 27: No.

[02:31:18] Speaker 24: No.

[02:31:19] Speaker 28: There's two species out there.

[02:31:20] Speaker 24: Uh-

[02:31:20] Speaker 27: Two species? Oh.

[02:31:20] Speaker 2: Yeah. It's probably good 'cause the fighters are in the front, but... Now bear in mind, there's a series of carts in front of you also.

[02:31:28] Speaker 24: Where are we in? Like, where are our carts in the line?

[02:31:32] Speaker 2: You are at the back of the line.

[02:31:33] Speaker 24: We're the caboose. Got it.

[02:31:34] Speaker 2: Yep. You guys are prote- protecting the rear.

[02:31:37] Speaker 28: We were hired super defend the back.

[02:31:39] Speaker 24: Awesome.

[02:31:42] Speaker 2: And it doesn't take long before wagon goes through. Uh, they, uh, the wagons start picking up speed. And you start passing, and goblins start-

[02:31:50] Speaker 25: Trying to outrun them?

[02:31:52] Speaker 28: Popping out.

[02:31:52] Speaker 25: Is that what our assumption is?

[02:31:54] Speaker 2: Trying to move through fast.

[02:31:55] Speaker 25: Yeah.

[02:31:55] Speaker 2: 'Cause these are coming on the ground.

[02:31:57] Speaker 25: Yeah, getting out of the... Oh, this was an ambushy type scenario.

[02:31:59] Speaker 24: Uh-oh.

[02:31:59] Speaker 28: Are these gits or do they look a little more-

[02:32:01] Speaker 2: They're goblins. They're a little bit older. They're probably full goblins at this point. Um, so you guys are coming through, and they're starting to... Again, they're kinda lined up here. This is just for showing purposes, like, yeah, there's a little-

[02:32:17] Speaker 28: Is Qotalr with a Q or a K?

[02:32:20] Speaker 25: Q-O-T-A-L, Qotalr.

[02:32:22] Speaker 28: Qotalr. Okay.

[02:32:25] Speaker 2: Yeah. Yeah.

[02:32:26] Speaker 28: I got the Q right, though.

[02:32:27] Speaker 2: Okay. Okay. So you can just go into initiative here. Basically have a ton of guys attacking. Now you can do attacks if you want to. You guys are passing through these guys kinda quick, so you can do things to... This is more like, we'll do a few rounds here where you can take and choose to do something. You can attack with a ma- with, uh... They're gonna be hard. Unless you have, really have reach, you're probably gonna have a hard time meleeing them. And if you think if you fall off a cart or jump off a cart, probably not gonna be-

[02:32:55] Speaker 28: We're gonna be left behind.

[02:32:56] Speaker 2: You're gonna, yeah, you might be rolling a new character for next week. So-

[02:32:58] Speaker 28: (laughs)

[02:32:58] Speaker 2: ... probably don't wanna do that. Um, but these have picked up. They're moving pretty fast, so again, it's a negative one for them to hit you, but same thing for you guys shooting back. So you can take range attacks. If you have other things you can do that you can think of to... Basically it's a full round action, three actions. Do things to persuade, you know, um, make it harder for them to hit you. You know, if you wanna do a skill or something like that, be creative, something.

[02:33:25] Speaker 24: Okay.

[02:33:26] Speaker 2: So we'll do a few rounds here. Be kinda like skill checky type rounds. Things you're doing while you're-

[02:33:31] Speaker 24: Mm-hmm.

[02:33:31] Speaker 2: ... in here. You could be trying to repair the carts. Remember, your guy's wagon had taken a little bit of damage before. You could use crafting. You could-

[02:33:38] Speaker 24: Do I get penalties for traveling in the sun? Is that a thing in...

[02:33:43] Speaker 2: Uh, no not in this one, 'cause, um, one of the things, one of the reasons dhampir actually go outside is vampires would, yes, but dhampir are not bothered by the sun.

[02:33:52] Speaker 24: Ah-ha. Except for me. Okay.

[02:33:56] Speaker 2: Probably don't l- love it, but I mean, it's, I mean, you're probably not gonna go sunbathing. Most dhampir wouldn't do that.

[02:34:01] Speaker 24: No power.

[02:34:01] Speaker 25: No mechanical penalties.

[02:34:02] Speaker 2: Yeah, there's no mechanical penalties. Uh, lore-wise, um, the sun radiates positive energy, and that's how things grow and bloom.

[02:34:12] Speaker 24: Yay.

[02:34:12] Speaker 2: Um, where you're kinda bothered by positive energy. Um, but when things die their positive energy goes away and it, it morphs into negative energy, um, which is why, um... Like again, you're half living and half undead, so... So who's first up on initiative?

[02:34:30] Speaker 24: You guys don't know that yet, though.

[02:34:32] Speaker 28: Um, do the goblins have-

[02:34:33] Speaker 2: Depends if you haven't shown him. Yeah, right now you've only... You could've emphasized your things or not.

[02:34:39] Speaker 28: Yeah.

[02:34:39] Speaker 24: Okay. I've been trying to, yeah.

[02:34:40] Speaker 28: It's called multi-tasking, right?

[02:34:40] Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. As far as you guys know, I'll point out, lore-wise she's just a greathyl. You don't know she's a dhampir, because she doesn't show you-

[02:34:46] Speaker 24: You guys don't know that I'm a dhampir yet.

[02:34:48] Speaker 28: Do the goblins get initiative, or?

[02:34:50] Speaker 2: No, they're just gonna be doing things at the, in between rounds.

[02:34:53] Speaker 28: Okay. Uh, well, first would be Arnor, the 24.

[02:34:56] Speaker 29: Okay. Uh, then I will start by... Don't suppose... Yeah, I can't see you or you.

[02:35:06] Speaker 2: If you're in the cart in front you could s- technically see them.

[02:35:09] Speaker 29: Great. Good enough. Uh, then I'll cast nudge fate on you again.

[02:35:12] Speaker 28: Uh-huh.

[02:35:14] Speaker 29: Um, and then I'm gonna needle darts at one of the...

[02:35:21] Speaker 2: Oh, yep. You can unleash. Or hay darts if you wanna unleash the hay at them.

[02:35:27] Speaker 29: 19.

[02:35:29] Speaker 2: Yep, that would hit. And each goblin here only has like six points of health, so it won't do too much to kill some.

[02:35:35] Speaker 29: That's more than six.

[02:35:37] Speaker 2: Okay. So yep, you guys, you, um, you'll spray some darts as you're going and, um, you can choose to either do it against a single goblin or you can just spray them with it. Um, if you spray them with it, yeah, that, that forces them to kinda get their head down. It r- reduces any attacks coming against you guys.

[02:35:54] Speaker 28: Sure, I can do that at 10.

[02:35:56] Speaker 2: Um, next up.

[02:35:57] Speaker 28: Uh, next up is me. Put my character name there though.

[02:36:02] Speaker 2: (laughs)

[02:36:05] Speaker 28: Okay, um, I will try and intimidate one of the goblins. Hey, back off before we chop the livers outta you.

[02:36:13] Speaker 24: (laughs)

[02:36:14] Speaker 2: This is more of a skill type thing. Again, so this could be, you know, intimidating all of them-

[02:36:17] Speaker 24: Yeah.

[02:36:17] Speaker 2: ... on certain sides.

[02:36:19] Speaker 28: Um, dirty 20.

[02:36:20] Speaker 2: Dirty 20? Okay. Um, 10 plus there. This is Will. All right.

[02:36:30] Speaker 24: E.

[02:36:31] Speaker 2: That would succeed. You think you are, um... These may be young goblins but maybe they've heard the stories of the slayers and, yeah, they're... You can tell them, you know, if you're just standing up there shouting at them, that's pretty intimidating for goblins who have, uh, I don't know, fiber scales.

[02:36:48] Speaker 28: Um, Aurelia is on deck.

[02:36:50] Speaker 30: Do I get two more actions, or?

[02:36:51] Speaker 2: Yeah. I mean, generally you take three actions you want... Uh, basically, but this is more of a skill check.

[02:36:55] Speaker 31: Yeah, I think I-

[02:36:56] Speaker 2: I'd rather just save my actions, so. (laughs)

[02:36:59] Speaker 30: Yeah.

[02:36:59] Speaker 32: All right. Aurelia is up next. Kaltal is on deck. That's, hey, it's table order. (instrumental music)

[02:37:06] Speaker 2: So, again, this is like more of a skill check thing. What do you wanna do to try to... It could be an attack, it could be a skill, something to try to... (instrumental music) So far they've been sprayed pretty accurately with some needle darts.

[02:37:18] Speaker 33: Who's driving these carts?

[02:37:19] Speaker 2: There are people, there are caravan people who are driving it. You can also instruct the caravan people to do something if you wanna arrange, um... It's a fairly wide road, so if you want to have them go to a different arrangement, you can ask them to do that.

[02:37:33] Speaker 34: If we leap, hmm, I was gonna say if we leaped off the carts, we would be able to catch up to them?

[02:37:40] Speaker 2: Carts are moving pretty quick. And you think if you hop off the carts onto the ground...

[02:37:44] Speaker 34: You're not gonna catch up to it, got it.

[02:37:46] Speaker 2: And then you're gonna have like 15 goblins and probably die a, a pin cushiony death. You could try to jump from one cart to the other. I mean, that, you know, there's a coolness factor that's always...

[02:37:56] Speaker 34: Hmm, nope, I'll take potshots at the goblin.

[02:38:01] Speaker 2: Okay, yep. You can just, yeah, go ahead and roll. See how your... taking some potshots as you go, see how you're generally doing.

[02:38:08] Speaker 34: 15.

[02:38:10] Speaker 2: Um, yeah, you're pretty accurate. I do mean you don't kill any, but combined with his needle darts, you can take some potshots as you go when you're forcing the goblins to kind of duck for cover a little bit. Last but not least.

[02:38:26] Speaker 31: I don't really have anything that is helpful, so he's just gonna, like, crouch down so he's harder to hit and, you know, maybe keep an eye on the driver to make sure the driver doesn't need any assistance controlling the horses.

[02:38:39] Speaker 2: (laughs) Yeah, you could do that. Like I said, if you wanna do a different arrangement with the carts, you can always do that too.

[02:38:46] Speaker 31: That's... Which ha- uh, correct pa- path is... The correct path is clearly to get through this. So we just want the carts to not get distracted or the horses to spook or anything like that.

[02:38:58] Speaker 2: Hmm, um, so we'll do another round. The, to continue along this way, there's still, you know, a lot of goblins coming up taking off. No, actually in between rounds-

[02:39:05] Speaker 31: Yeah, the goblins get a turn before.

[02:39:07] Speaker 2: So, um, basically they're, they're just taking little slings and slinging at you guys. Probably minimal damage, but, uh, they're still taking some shots. And their heads are kind of down because you guys have effectively kind of intimidated them and got them hiding and whatnot. So we'll just kind of go from side to side. So you have to roll really high. They don't get you against any shots on you. One of them crits you.

[02:39:30] Speaker 31: Ah.

[02:39:31] Speaker 2: So they don't do a lot of damage here. These are just little slings. So one of them hits you, uh, Aurelia, for three points of damage.

[02:39:37] Speaker 31: Right.

[02:39:37] Speaker 2: Um, against your guy, they're just slinging at you.

[02:39:39] Speaker 32: Yeah, AC18.

[02:39:41] Speaker 2: Um, they both would hit an AC18, but just barely.

[02:39:44] Speaker 32: Boom.

[02:39:45] Speaker 2: If they did well 15 and 16, they wouldn't have, so. Um, two and three is five points of damage altogether.

[02:39:53] Speaker 31: Oh, no. My rage temptation-

[02:39:53] Speaker 2: And last but not least, there's just a bunch of... a hail of shots. One of them is going to be a 20 something to hit you.

[02:39:59] Speaker 34: That's great. That's cool.

[02:39:59] Speaker 2: And that's going to be...

[02:40:00] Speaker 32: Yeah, I mean, tomorrow ready to go.

[02:40:01] Speaker 2: Two points of damage from the rocks they're slinging at you. Okay, we go to the next round. Again, you can do skill checks, basically things to get them to... Different things you can think of.

[02:40:11] Speaker 32: Starting with Matthew.

[02:40:14] Speaker 2: And actually, I'll give you a second to think because I'm gonna get some more water. Do you need something as well or anyone else need a drink? Okay, I'll be right back. (instrumental music)

[02:40:32] Speaker 32: Yeah, this is a tough position for the melee characters.

[02:40:39] Speaker 34: Which everyone's your own... Well, no, I don't know that. Never mind.

[02:40:43] Speaker 32: Well, I threw one at the orc yesterday, a couple of days ago, whenever it was. But yeah, it is.

[02:40:57] Speaker 34: Do we have to tell the NPCs to do something or do they just do stuff on their own?

[02:41:03] Speaker 2: I mean, they're driving the carts on their own. If you want them to do anything special, you could ask them to do that.

[02:41:07] Speaker 34: Hmm, got it. Okay.

[02:41:09] Speaker 2: You could use diplomacy to try to, um, you know, encourage them or to request they do something different than just drive the wagon. Um...

[02:41:19] Speaker 34: Yeah, if they're driving, no, that's important.

[02:41:21] Speaker 31: I only have 20 feet of speed. Oh my God, I had no idea.

[02:41:24] Speaker 34: Short legs.

[02:41:25] Speaker 33: Welcome to being a dwarf, my friend.

[02:41:27] Speaker 32: Yeah.

[02:41:28] Speaker 34: (laughs)

[02:41:28] Speaker 33: The greatest race of all time.

[02:41:30] Speaker 30: Like a little corgi, just wee.

[02:41:32] Speaker 34: (laughs)

[02:41:33] Speaker 2: They can eventually take fleet.

[02:41:34] Speaker 33: We are excellent sprinters. We do not do well on these long distances.

[02:41:39] Speaker 30: Apparently, you're not a great sprinter either. (laughs)

[02:41:43] Speaker 33: I am lying up my ass.

[02:41:44] Speaker 34: (laughs)

[02:41:46] Speaker 30: Um-

[02:41:46] Speaker 2: I don't know what they... I... In the old edition, I know there's a feat you can take, the barbarian feat that when you're raging, you get bonus speed. I don't know how that works in the remaster.

[02:41:55] Speaker 32: We'll see if it comes up or not.

[02:41:57] Speaker 2: It should, 'cause I know they do get something tied to that.

[02:42:00] Speaker 31: Um, these are goblins, and you said that they're superstitious?

[02:42:04] Speaker 2: Yep.

[02:42:05] Speaker 31: Then I would like to make an occultism check to make like the symbol of the evil eye at them to intimidate them into, uh, leaving us alone.

[02:42:15] Speaker 2: Yep, you can do that. Yeah, they're definitely-

[02:42:16] Speaker 34: You picked another occultism character, of course.

[02:42:19] Speaker 31: Well, I didn't intend to.

[02:42:22] Speaker 34: (laughs)

[02:42:22] Speaker 2: (laughs)

[02:42:22] Speaker 32: (laughs)

[02:42:22] Speaker 31: But it was the, it was the option for my particular class that I was interested in, and it just-

[02:42:28] Speaker 2: Sorcerer.

[02:42:28] Speaker 34: (laughs)

[02:42:29] Speaker 31: Yes. I'm totally a sorcerer.

[02:42:32] Speaker 34: That's a 2.0.

[02:42:33] Speaker 31: (laughs) Sorcerer is what he would call himself if anyone sees him doing magic. All right, uh-

[02:42:42] Speaker 34: That's a lot. 20.

[02:42:43] Speaker 31: Total of 20.

[02:42:45] Speaker 2: Okay, yeah, that's more than good enough. So, yeah, as some of the goblins who are watching you see that, you see they start... Some of them actually start panicking and running away.

[02:42:53] Speaker 34: (laughs) Cowards.

[02:42:54] Speaker 2: Um, and some of the other ones are kind of reconsidering their life decisions at this moment.

[02:42:58] Speaker 34: (laughs)

[02:43:00] Speaker 2: So you guys have one good success against him.

[02:43:01] Speaker 35: Oh, that's great.

[02:43:02] Speaker 2: Next up.

[02:43:02] Speaker 36: Um, I will try and rally the driver. My friend, I remember the time that I once got locked in a goblin stew. It was not a good experience. You must move on. And diplomacy, uh, that's a 14.

[02:43:22] Speaker 2: Um, given the circumstance, um, he would probably do that. He whips the horse a little bit harder. He doesn't get a lot of speed, so it's not a full success, but I mean, it was enough that maybe he'll... You know, you guys notice he's starting to gain on you guys. Maybe, uh-

[02:43:36] Speaker 36: Oh, I'm in the front car.

[02:43:37] Speaker 2: Oh, you're the front one? Yeah, so you're actually-

[02:43:39] Speaker 36: So you leave him behind.

[02:43:40] Speaker 2: He goes, you guys, behind.

[02:43:41] Speaker 36: See ya, guys.

[02:43:41] Speaker 2: Little bit further away.

[02:43:44] Speaker 35: Okay.

[02:43:45] Speaker 2: Next up.

[02:43:47] Speaker 35: Seeing that, I would probably inspire and encourage our driver to be like, w- uh, "We can't l- can't l- can't lose them."

[02:44:03] Speaker 2: So you could probably do, um, well obviously diplomacy or you could do intimidation, just tell him to move his ass, or you could do bluff to say, "They're gaining on us, move it."

[02:44:13] Speaker 35: Um, 14.

[02:44:15] Speaker 2: Okay, which one are you using?

[02:44:16] Speaker 35: Uh...

[02:44:22] Speaker 2: Ideally before you roll but, uh-

[02:44:24] Speaker 35: Yeah. Intimidation.

[02:44:27] Speaker 2: Intimidation? Um, I mean he's not particularly intimidated. He's more like frustrated right now. I mean, a 14's good. You'll pick up a little bit of speed but, um, he's like, you know, um, "I heard you the first time. Don't, uh... I'm doing my, just doing my job. Laugh at back, mom." Um, so next up.

[02:44:49] Speaker 7: Having seen what my warlock friend has done.

[02:44:54] Speaker 37: (laughs)

[02:44:54] Speaker 35: (laughs)

[02:44:55] Speaker 7: Not a witch.

[02:44:58] Speaker 37: (laughs)

[02:44:59] Speaker 7: He's, he's a man. He's a warlock. I will stand and begin and I will also... I rec- I recognized it because of my knowledge, um, and I will begin...

[02:45:13] Speaker 35: (laughs)

[02:45:14] Speaker 7: I will make up some kind of like, chant that calls upon whatever the evil god-

[02:45:20] Speaker 35: (laughs)

[02:45:20] Speaker 7: ... is that they are paranoid about and, and call, and call down his wrath, you know, upon them to further frighten them with occultism. That is 13.

[02:45:36] Speaker 2: Probably not a n- I mean, the only thing is also language gap. Like, yours was visual right? They saw the...

[02:45:41] Speaker 38: Yeah, um-

[02:45:42] Speaker 2: Um-

[02:45:42] Speaker 38: I was making a specific hand gesture.

[02:45:44] Speaker 2: No, I mean if you were saying things you might have said something that maybe of caused it to glow a little bit harder but the thing is not particularly high though, so it doesn't... But it get, he'll pour into her anyway. So now we go to the next round, the goblins are still shouting. Um, both Sylvia and uh, um, Lynn have, you know, various things they'll do to help out with the guardsmen. Um, you notice that some of the goblins, um, on the side start yelping and chanting and you hear this really weird growl sound as things are moving and as you look behind you-

[02:46:18] Speaker 35: Uh-oh.

[02:46:18] Speaker 2: ... first you see some goblins chasing you.

[02:46:24] Speaker 35: Let me guess, they brought a bag of wargs.

[02:46:26] Speaker 7: Brought in spiders. And I'm going to move you guys forward a little bit.

[02:46:30] Speaker 35: Bringing spiders?

[02:46:31] Speaker 36: Spiders.

[02:46:33] Speaker 2: So yes, you still have some goblins.

[02:46:35] Speaker 36: Don't let them gunk up the wheels.

[02:46:37] Speaker 2: 'Cause that's not the only thing you see, and move a little bit further.

[02:46:41] Speaker 35: Uh-oh.

[02:46:42] Speaker 2: You have... They're skittering, yelping things at you and alongside them, you have some bouncing things.

[02:46:58] Speaker 38: Mm.

[02:47:01] Speaker 35: Here my brain is imagining like classic goblins riding wargs. Uh, nope.

[02:47:07] Speaker 36: Yeah, I- my brain also went there.

[02:47:08] Speaker 35: (laughs) I was just like, "Oh, okay, we got warg riders." I was like, "Wait a minute."

[02:47:12] Speaker 7: Mm-hmm. This isn't Lord of The Rings, it's Pathfinder.

[02:47:17] Speaker 2: So yep, they're skittering at you. Um, so, um, we'll do the two riders on one initiative and then we'll do the, uh, spider riders. And then the squigs we'll do as, uh, red and blue why not? We'll do 'em in two groups. One and two. Yeah, these have to sit on top.

[02:47:52] Speaker 35: Ne- they need, uh, square number things like that for square platforms.

[02:47:57] Speaker 2: Yeah. I think, uh, if I can... These are the only ones with circles. Well, I can make them bigger and then it would work but those guys weren't... So, um... Oh yeah, initiative's on.

[02:48:09] Speaker 36: So it's the reds paired together or the ones paired together?

[02:48:11] Speaker 2: Uh, the reds.

[02:48:12] Speaker 36: Okay.

[02:48:12] Speaker 2: Reds and blues.

[02:48:13] Speaker 36: Gotcha.

[02:48:14] Speaker 2: Um, so, uh, the riders... I think it's a... There we go. Um, we have a 16 here. And in their cases, they're, the spiders or their amount is one thing, so can only tag them independently. And I got to mark those as one and two also. Um, group red is 19. Red, one eye. And blue is 11.... same. So we're gonna do skull and stripes. Skull having a skull and stripes having the stripes. Okay. So who, uh, top of the order? Who's up?

[02:49:21] Speaker 39: Uh, that would be Arnor still. Do the goblins not get a turn or was summoning the people their turn?

[02:49:28] Speaker 2: Um, they didn't summon 'em. These have been chasing you.

[02:49:30] Speaker 39: Right.

[02:49:30] Speaker 2: They kinda jump outta the bush. These guys, es- especially because of like the religious and other stuff you guys are doing, the, the imposing... dwarf and whatnot, um, they've, they're kinda head on. Yes, you do have missiles and whatnot shooting at you guys, but I'm actually, well, you'll probably take a rock or two to the head here and there. But not enough to really...

[02:49:50] Speaker 39: Okay. Well, on Arnor then. Uh, Squig, Aara and the goblins are gone, the riders are in back.

[02:49:56] Speaker 40: Yeah. Uh, I'm gonna cast the spell biting words. I entwine my magic with my voice causing your taunts and jaw- jibes to physically harm your enemies. Um, and then I can make an attack roll, uh, as, as I finish casting it and then I can use it again up to three more times.

[02:50:20] Speaker 2: Is there a range?

[02:50:21] Speaker 40: Unless-

[02:50:21] Speaker 2: Oh, is there a range on it I'm curiosing about?

[02:50:22] Speaker 40: Oh, you're right. Oh, what's the range? 30 feet. 30-

[02:50:28] Speaker 2: What you might be able to do, 'cause you're right there, they're pretty far.

[02:50:31] Speaker 40: You could-

[02:50:32] Speaker 2: 10, 15, 20, 25. Ah, they're just outside 30. You could ready it. If you spend one more action you could ready it. And when they move into range, which they probably will-

[02:50:41] Speaker 40: Yeah.

[02:50:41] Speaker 2: ... you cast it at that point.

[02:50:42] Speaker 40: All right. So, I will cast it and ready the use of it and when they come in range, I will insult them. (laughs)

[02:50:51] Speaker 2: (laughs) Okay. And who is, so then who is next? It was-

[02:50:53] Speaker 39: Squig, Aara.

[02:50:54] Speaker 2: Okay, the reds.

[02:50:56] Speaker 40: Um-

[02:50:56] Speaker 39: Goblin riders are after that.

[02:51:00] Speaker 40: I'm gonna ready it for one of the spider, spider riders. (laughs)

[02:51:02] Speaker 2: So your coins are bounciers.

[02:51:04] Speaker 40: I don't want it.

[02:51:05] Speaker 2: So they bounce?

[02:51:07] Speaker 40: They always throw in a little ones. Yeah. It is a level 12 spell.

[02:51:12] Speaker 2: Bounce. There. That was one action. Do a balance again.

[02:51:22] Speaker 39: I'm in the wrong cart.

[02:51:23] Speaker 40: (laughs)

[02:51:24] Speaker 39: Yeah.

[02:51:25] Speaker 2: Bounce.

[02:51:26] Speaker 41: I contemplated leaping to the front cart, but I don't know if I'm gonna-

[02:51:29] Speaker 2: There.

[02:51:30] Speaker 41: Do that.

[02:51:30] Speaker 2: He was gonna go there.

[02:51:31] Speaker 39: There's a spot at the back.

[02:51:31] Speaker 2: He'll go up to one of you two. This one would bounce, he is a 35, he's gonna bounce to there and he's gonna take a chomp at one of the ones on that side of the two NPCs, luckily. Um, so the one attack on the two on that side. Let's see. Um, even/odd. Even. So it's attacking Aurelia with its one attack. Um-

[02:51:55] Speaker 40: Great.

[02:51:58] Speaker 2: (coughs) Excuse me. (laughs) Here we go.

[02:52:05] Speaker 41: What are... These are like-

[02:52:07] Speaker 2: These are-

[02:52:07] Speaker 41: ... bouncing reptiles?

[02:52:10] Speaker 2: You can always do a, uh, recall knowledge to find out what they are. Which is a good thing for your character to have, by the way. Um, they attack you for a 19, actually be an 18 because remember there is a negative one to all attacks here.

[02:52:21] Speaker 41: That hits.

[02:52:22] Speaker 2: Hits for, uh, eight points of damage. Okay. Uh, that's it for him. The other guy will attack one of the two NPCs. Uh, he'll hit for three. Five actually. And that would be, so... Okay. Uh, next up was the riders.

[02:52:54] Speaker 40: Yep.

[02:52:54] Speaker 2: They're scurrying, so one goes two or three squares forward. I think two, we'll say three and then your ability will go off.

[02:53:01] Speaker 40: Yep. All right. So, (dice rolling) yeah. 12.

[02:53:13] Speaker 2: Uh, 12. And you're attacking the... And this is the roll to hit?

[02:53:18] Speaker 40: Mm-hmm.

[02:53:19] Speaker 2: Uh, would miss.

[02:53:20] Speaker 40: All right. One use down. Just have to keep track. Right. That's it.

[02:53:30] Speaker 2: Okay. Good, then continue scurrying up. It's probably only going to take two actions to get up to you guys here. Probably attack, since you're the closest one, he'd attack Aurelia.

[02:53:39] Speaker 40: Good.

[02:53:40] Speaker 2: Um-

[02:53:42] Speaker 39: I think gray.

[02:53:43] Speaker 2: (laughs) 24.

[02:53:47] Speaker 40: That's a hit.

[02:53:49] Speaker 2: Uh, for a grand total of four points of damage.

[02:53:53] Speaker 40: I know.

[02:53:56] Speaker 39: Already?

[02:53:57] Speaker 41: I, the last attack had took out like seven of my hit points.

[02:54:03] Speaker 39: Oh, no.

[02:54:06] Speaker 2: Okay. Well, I'm not gonna knock you down though, there it was.

[02:54:08] Speaker 39: No, you aren't. Too crowded.

[02:54:10] Speaker 2: And next up. Oh, the other guy.

[02:54:12] Speaker 39: The goblin rider.

[02:54:13] Speaker 40: (coughs)

[02:54:14] Speaker 2: Only get to attack is Lynn. Um, he crits.

[02:54:20] Speaker 39: Lynn. No.

[02:54:22] Speaker 2: Okay. Um, next up.

[02:54:25] Speaker 39: Next is me. Um, Aurelia is not on deck 'cause things moved around.

[02:54:29] Speaker 2: And you guys, as part of your action, you can tell the driver to do things so he could, you can tell him to slow down and blitz which would allow you guys to... effectively, I guess you can move the cart backwards if you wanted to.

[02:54:41] Speaker 39: Yeah, by slowing down.

[02:54:43] Speaker 2: Yeah.

[02:54:43] Speaker 39: Not by actually moving backwards.

[02:54:44] Speaker 40: Yeah. My worry is just th- that cart is so crowded and like how am I gonna jump on it?

[02:54:49] Speaker 2: You necessarily have to 'cause you can stall your car to-

[02:54:52] Speaker 40: Make the cart side-by-side.

[02:54:53] Speaker 2: Yeah. You can do the-

[02:54:54] Speaker 41: Is this path, is the wide path wide enough for side-by-side?

[02:54:58] Speaker 2: Yeah. I- like this one here, it is wide enough you guys could do that. If you're slightly off the road, it's not gonna impact it too much.

[02:55:04] Speaker 39: Uh, blue is on deck.

[02:55:05] Speaker 2: Oh.

[02:55:06] Speaker 39: But question, like would it be an action to convey that to them?

[02:55:09] Speaker 2: Yeah. It'd be an action and it'd allow you guys to move it backwards. Because otherwise yeah, you're outta the fight and it's kinda important for you guys.

[02:55:16] Speaker 39: "Driver, pull up to the side with the other cart." (laughs)

[02:55:19] Speaker 2: So he'll do that, which I'll give it, like, 35. But it could move at least this turn, like, to right there if you want.

[02:55:24] Speaker 39: Okay. I'll take that.

[02:55:25] Speaker 2: And then, yeah, then you can be-

[02:55:26] Speaker 39: Yeah, I'll back away for that. I thought maybe I'd have to wait until the turn after that-

[02:55:30] Speaker 2: Uh-huh.

[02:55:30] Speaker 39: ... so I'm really happy it happened this turn. Um, yeah. Walked away.

[02:55:34] Speaker 42: Did you use... You guys are on level one each time around.

[02:55:35] Speaker 43: Did he use his reaction? The driver used his reaction to do it on you.

[02:55:38] Speaker 39: Oh, yeah. He was ready to action.

[02:55:39] Speaker 42: (laughs)

[02:55:40] Speaker 43: He had a reaction.

[02:55:41] Speaker 2: He's not gonna argue with the dwarven slayer.

[02:55:44] Speaker 39: Um, does a 12 hit?

[02:55:45] Speaker 44: Good plan.

[02:55:46] Speaker 2: Um, let's see. These guys will not... No, there's... They have a decently-

[02:55:52] Speaker 39: Yeah.

[02:55:52] Speaker 2: ... thick hide.

[02:55:54] Speaker 39: You know what? I really wanna hit.

[02:55:57] Speaker 2: And we're getting close to the next one.

[02:55:59] Speaker 39: Okay, does the 13 hit?

[02:56:01] Speaker 2: (laughs) No, unfortunately.

[02:56:03] Speaker 39: Ah. Oh, actually it would have been 12 with the penalty. Um, second attack. Not 20. Okay. (laughs) Uh, that's, uh, three plus one, so... Uh, 14 bludgeoning and six spirit.

[02:56:22] Speaker 2: (laughs) That is weird enough, just enough. These are tough little buggers.

[02:56:28] Speaker 39: Well, not that tough.

[02:56:29] Speaker 2: Yeah.

[02:56:30] Speaker 39: Wha-ch. Swing. Ba-da-ba-da-ba.

[02:56:33] Speaker 2: You don't know what you killed. Basically, uh, a mouth with legs. But, uh, (laughs) yeah, you pretty much-

[02:56:39] Speaker 39: This place is gonna be so much fun.

[02:56:41] Speaker 2: ... battered him right up.

[02:56:42] Speaker 39: And that is my turn. Next up is Blue.

[02:56:45] Speaker 2: Yeah, you notice the dwarf's enjoying himself a little too much right now.

[02:56:47] Speaker 39: Mm-hmm.

[02:56:49] Speaker 2: Um, so Blue is next. Um, I just gotta take, um, two actions to get... It's probably taking him all three actions to balance. Here, I'm probably gonna say it's taking him all three actions to balance up to there. Um...

[02:57:03] Speaker 39: Getting run over by the cart?

[02:57:04] Speaker 2: No, they're jumping. They're kinda just balancing right beside it.

[02:57:09] Speaker 39: KotalH is up. Um, then we're at the end of the round if the goblins are going to do anything.

[02:57:14] Speaker 2: Oh. Uh, no, I'll let you...

[02:57:16] Speaker 42: I like... I yell, "Move us back further." (laughs)

[02:57:20] Speaker 2: (laughs) Um, yeah, he could still move us back.

[02:57:21] Speaker 39: He has another reaction.

[02:57:24] Speaker 42: Can he run over the one?

[02:57:26] Speaker 45: That's enough. Don't care.

[02:57:28] Speaker 42: Uh-uh.

[02:57:29] Speaker 45: And then I will use my-

[02:57:30] Speaker 39: 'Cause he's not moving back.

[02:57:30] Speaker 45: I have reach. I will, uh, flurry the mouth.

[02:57:34] Speaker 2: What you should do is hop on the carts and just, you know, doing the splits over the-

[02:57:38] Speaker 44: (laughs)

[02:57:39] Speaker 45: My god.

[02:57:40] Speaker 2: The rule of cool is always in effect, so...

[02:57:43] Speaker 42: Um, 18.

[02:57:46] Speaker 2: 18. Oh, let's see. Guess that guy would hit.

[02:57:49] Speaker 44: Yay.

[02:57:50] Speaker 42: That was nine bludgeoning.

[02:57:53] Speaker 2: And that is rue, uh... Let's see, that's...

[02:57:54] Speaker 42: Blue two.

[02:57:56] Speaker 2: Blue two. The second attack missed. Final action as Parry.

[02:58:04] Speaker 42: Blue two. And then blue one was dead. No, blue one's over there.

[02:58:06] Speaker 39: Blue one's on the other side.

[02:58:07] Speaker 2: The other guy's dead. Okay. Um, so how much did you do to him? To Blue two?

[02:58:11] Speaker 42: Uh, five plus four, nine.

[02:58:13] Speaker 2: Nine? Okay, that's a good solid blow.

[02:58:14] Speaker 39: Think you oughta use one of your actions to pull us back, so... Another one for the-

[02:58:19] Speaker 2: Well, it'd be a flurry.

[02:58:20] Speaker 42: It's flurry blows, so... One to move now.

[02:58:23] Speaker 2: It's one action.

[02:58:24] Speaker 39: Oh, flurry's one?

[02:58:25] Speaker 42: Yeah.

[02:58:25] Speaker 2: Yeah, flurry's not as good as the... Well, 'cause a ranger one is just two action. Flurry's one action, but you have the multiple attack penalty.

[02:58:30] Speaker 39: Mm.

[02:58:31] Speaker 42: It's just action efficiency, not-

[02:58:33] Speaker 2: Yeah.

[02:58:34] Speaker 39: It's been a while since I've played more. I forgot.

[02:58:36] Speaker 45: Hey, everyone.

[02:58:36] Speaker 2: The ranger one is nice, though. Two... It's two actions, but two attacks with no map, you know, no penalty-

[02:58:41] Speaker 39: That's good.

[02:58:41] Speaker 2: ... is really nice.

[02:58:42] Speaker 39: Yeah. Okay, um, let's do these goblins.

[02:58:45] Speaker 42: This means I have leftover action for Perry.

[02:58:47] Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.

[02:58:47] Speaker 44: Oh, wait. Do I go before the, the viking guys?

[02:58:48] Speaker 39: Or do another funky stuff.

[02:58:49] Speaker 42: Yeah. Or eventually I'll have to-

[02:58:50] Speaker 45: You, you're mission of goblin move, you're gonna go before the goblin army.

[02:58:53] Speaker 39: You're gonna go before the goblins.

[02:58:53] Speaker 42: Oh, shit.

[02:58:54] Speaker 39: The goblin riders were the ones that took you down, right?

[02:58:56] Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.

[02:58:57] Speaker 39: Yeah.

[02:58:57] Speaker 44: Yeah, the one on the spider did.

[02:58:59] Speaker 39: Yeah. Uh, so-

[02:59:00] Speaker 42: So you get moved right before the thing that killed you so that the rest of the party has the maximum amount of time to get you stable before the guy killed you goes again.

[02:59:08] Speaker 44: Hey.

[02:59:08] Speaker 39: Sucks that I got no healing.

[02:59:10] Speaker 2: (laughs) Yeah, probably the one, the, the missing party member at the, uh, (laughs) camp also happens to be the one with some pretty good, uh, healing. Well, I don't know how much.

[02:59:18] Speaker 42: I s- haven't noticed any cli- Gee, it'd be nice if there was a cleric in the party.

[02:59:23] Speaker 44: (laughs)

[02:59:23] Speaker 2: (laughs)

[02:59:24] Speaker 42: I think in last week's session, there was an announcement that we might have a cleric.

[02:59:28] Speaker 2: (laughs)

[02:59:29] Speaker 44: Maybe.

[02:59:31] Speaker 39: Uh, goblins, if they're doing anything, otherwise I'm out.

[02:59:33] Speaker 42: I think it was cleric, monk, uh, barbarian, sorcerer-

[02:59:36] Speaker 2: Who is next? I'm sorry.

[02:59:37] Speaker 39: And goblins, if they're doing anything.

[02:59:38] Speaker 42: ... and rogue.

[02:59:39] Speaker 2: Um, no. They'll basically just keep chucking rocks at you guys, but they're pretty im- intimidated at this point.

[02:59:44] Speaker 39: All right. R&R is next, uh, followed by Red.

[02:59:48] Speaker 42: (gurgles)

[02:59:49] Speaker 43: All right. We're gonna start with, uh, my biting words. So I will target the goblin rider that's closest to-
