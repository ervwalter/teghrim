DURATION:6899.967
[00:00:00] Speaker 1: Um, I was planning out, the bridge is not exactly to scale. (instrumental music) I did have a map of the area but I'm revisiting some stuff on that so ￼￼￼ I'm gonna fill more here in my time.

[00:00:08] Speaker 2: Did you add boats?

[00:00:09] Speaker 1: Yeah, I added boats and a raft.

[00:00:12] Speaker 3: I like the staircase leading down to the dock on this side.

[00:00:16] Speaker 1: So, um, this isn't obviously to scale. Um, I guess the river's kinda like maybe the size of Missouri at parts. Um, it's... This is more of a narrow part of the river where the, the only part where they could actually get a bridge built across. But this is, uh, the buildings are actually much taller. Um, you can actually fit wagons underneath it whereas by the train here you actually couldn't. It's too small. But, so this is a little bit bigger than it looks like. Um, (coughs) as you guys had wrote in the night before, um, or when you just arrived, where we ended up last session you two were at, you guys had just arrived and you had saw, you'd seen the bridge. Um, that night you guys were just rushed up, you were moved into one of the, um, um, places. So there's a few buildings on the bridge. Um, so this center one right here, um, the bottom level or this first level is kind of a cooking/dining area. The area above it is, uh, kind of, uh, there's a few rooms there for some of the staff and whatnot. Um, we had a guy over there, he, uh, caravan sleeps there. At the very top part is just, um, it's an attic kind of where there's sleeping bags set up on the floor where people can sleep. Um, you guys were initially rushed into one of the two other buildings. Um, this first building over here, the first level is kind of a general store more dedicated to, um-

[00:01:37] Speaker 3: (laughs)

[00:01:37] Speaker 1: ... wagoneering, um-

[00:01:39] Speaker 3: That's the first tower?

[00:01:40] Speaker 1: This one here, yeah.

[00:01:42] Speaker 3: Okay.

[00:01:42] Speaker 1: So this very first level is kind of a general store but it's mostly for, like, fixing wagons, repair, hammers, tools, stuff like that. The second level is, um, a place for people to stay but it's more, like, fancier people who are like the caravan leaders, that's kinda where they would stay.

[00:01:57] Speaker 3: Okay.

[00:01:58] Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.

[00:01:58] Speaker 1: Very top level is kinda like a hostel. It's just bed rolls and bunk beds. Um, same thing with this one. The, the first part is more of a general store but it's more of a general store towards, uh, consumables, produce, um, things you might eat. Stuff like that. Um, second level and, and third level are kind of the same. It's housing for rich people followed by, um-

[00:02:19] Speaker 3: Is there figure hanging?

[00:02:21] Speaker 1: Or a-

[00:02:21] Speaker 2: Or they get up there and buy into it as time goes on.

[00:02:24] Speaker 1: And then the very top one. Um, more just fluff right now. I don't have that much time to go into it. Don't wanna set this up every week here. Um, but there will be some ￼sessions that definitely take place on it. And the very top part once again is just places to rest. Um-

[00:02:36] Speaker 2: Well, if we don't have a major combat on this bridge at least once, I'm gonna be very disappointed in you Craig.

[00:02:40] Speaker 3: I was about to say yeah, that's... Yeah.

[00:02:42] Speaker 2: (laughs)

[00:02:42] Speaker 1: Yeah, if I'm putting all time and effort into it, it has to be used more than once.

[00:02:45] Speaker 2: Yeah.

[00:02:46] Speaker 1: But when you guys were first rushed in, you were rushed in with the caravan. They, the night you guys got here you were moved into one of the top bunks. Um, you know, crowded, stuffy. You're also on a bridge kind of in the summertime. Um, so it was humid, um, and whatnot. You got a kind of a basic rest. You were mostly just caravaning for the night.

[00:03:05] Speaker 4: We stopped right when we got back so probably not.

[00:03:08] Speaker 1: Um, so the following day each of you guys had your own little adventure that you, um, led into. Um, you got up earlier in the morning. You guys had met, you guys weren't here for this but your characters were. You met with a, um, dwarf by the name of Urca. Um, as a matter of fact if you look over at the poster board over there, Urca is the third one in.

[00:03:26] Speaker 2: Oh, I know the ￼third one in.

[00:03:27] Speaker 5: I haven't noticed the poster board yet.

[00:03:28] Speaker 1: Eventually it's gonna hang-

[00:03:29] Speaker 3: This one?

[00:03:30] Speaker 1: Yeah. Yeah, the dwarf. Eventually it's gonna hang right there. Um, I'll get to that poster board here in a little bit. But you guys met Urca. He's like the head commander, commandant, however you're gonna call him, over this bridge. Um, he kinda runs it, manages the caravans or anything the hell goes on. Um, and he had set you guys off on, um, two different tasks. Um, you guys went off, completed those tasks. Um, by the time you guys got back, it was probably late at night. You headed back in, um, crashed again in one of the top levels of one of the hostels. Um-

[00:04:02] Speaker 5: Those doors are different.

[00:04:03] Speaker 1: What's that?

[00:04:04] Speaker 5: You have a first time... I switched them.

[00:04:06] Speaker 6: So east and west is the opposite of last time?

[00:04:08] Speaker 2: Yeah, but there's no like, uh... I was just noticing they're, like, they're different.

[00:04:11] Speaker 5: Oh.

[00:04:12] Speaker 2: The towers themselves are different.

[00:04:13] Speaker 1: Yeah. They have, um... They're actually multi-part in terms of even a few different ones I did in print that you can interchange.

[00:04:19] Speaker 3: Am I supposed to be at zero health?

[00:04:22] Speaker 1: Um, we didn't do anything with your characters so you might have those wrong.

[00:04:25] Speaker 2: (laughs) Okay.

[00:04:26] Speaker 3: Rest and prepare, got it.

[00:04:28] Speaker 2: Now I'm gonna need to use them.

[00:04:29] Speaker 1: So... Oh, and I think by next time we play I will have a tablet. Basically I'm just gonna replace my iPad. The one I have now works perfectly so you can just use that one when you're here.

[00:04:39] Speaker 3: Okay.

[00:04:39] Speaker 1: Um, which works really good for your lab.

[00:04:41] Speaker 3: I've never really played on a tablet so-

[00:04:44] Speaker 1: It's, yeah.

[00:04:44] Speaker 3: ... I can't guarantee it'll go well but I'll try it.

[00:04:46] Speaker 1: No it goes, it's pretty easy. You just point and touch for the most part. Um, but yeah, there's gonna be a lot of terrain where a lot of times even like tonight where there's not gonna be much board space or table space. Um, but next, but next time that's-

[00:05:00] Speaker 6: I forgot again, I was gonna bring a dice tray.

[00:05:02] Speaker 1: Oh.

[00:05:02] Speaker 5: You're gonna eventually have like a-

[00:05:04] Speaker 2: Yeah, that's what I'm-

[00:05:05] Speaker 6: ... lip or something where I could put a dice tray? How big so I can bring the right size dice tray?

[00:05:10] Speaker 1: Um, it's gonna be about this wide and yours will probably go the length of the... So if you look at this-

[00:05:18] Speaker 6: Okay, yeah. I think I've got like a little rect-

[00:05:20] Speaker 1: You can put dice-

[00:05:21] Speaker 6: A little rectangular one.

[00:05:22] Speaker 1: You can put dice and stuff on the table. It's just, um-

[00:05:25] Speaker 6: I mean this slides around so I kinda just want to have something on the table.

[00:05:29] Speaker 1: Um, yeah, I mean like dice trays and stuff like that are fine, it's just that once we get into it there's just not gonna be like a lot of space left on the top of the board, especially like laptop space.

[00:05:37] Speaker 3: I mean I have a smaller dice tray at home but I just don't use it often.

[00:05:41] Speaker 1: I think that'll probably be all right. It's more, by the time we leave these like laptops off the table then it'll free up a lot more space and then we'll, we'll, uh... Dice trays are easy to move around too. They're usually not that big. Um, but, so that should be set up hopefully by next time because I'm on vacation. Not next week, but the week after vacation. That's probably the main thing I'm gonna get done is getting those things built somehow. I have a few designs in my head and I have to figure out the right one. But anyway, that's neither here nor there. Um-So, uh, you guys had come. You'd rested up for the, um, night. The next morning comes. You guys basically come down. You meet in, uh, one of the, uh-

[00:06:18] Speaker 7: Oh, we did rest up there?

[00:06:19] Speaker 8: We did rest after we, uh-

[00:06:19] Speaker 1: Yeah, you guys got a rest. Okay. (coughs)

[00:06:22] Speaker 8: Sweet.

[00:06:23] Speaker 1: This is now the following day, so you guys are now... Do one of those pencils... Oh. And the ones you don't need, just go ahead and pass those back to me there. Uh, get those out of the way. If you have a pencil and, uh-

[00:06:36] Speaker 7: Just a pen. A pencil

[00:06:38] Speaker 9: Yeah.

[00:06:38] Speaker 1: Right, right. That's fine. I just have two. So, you guys had originally began your journey in the month of Astra Helios, um, on the 24th is when you began. It took you guys quite a while, just being on the wagon and traveling out here. A few weeks, you arrived on the 6th of Astra Stendar, um, which is the equivalent of June or no, wait... No, that's not right. Of August. Went backwards. Astra Orpheus. Orpheus is the deity, um, generally he's... There, there's three patron deities that are kind of more over the arts. And Orpheus is a lot of, um, actors, stage play, poetry. Stuff like that. Um, so it's the 6th, is when you guys arrived. Here we go. Bunching again. Um.

[00:07:49] Speaker 10: Roll for weather.

[00:07:49] Speaker 1: (laughs)

[00:07:51] Speaker 11: Yeah.

[00:07:51] Speaker 1: Okay. So you guys had a- (coughs)

[00:07:53] Speaker 11: I'm gonna assume Craig has a weather dice just like you have.

[00:07:56] Speaker 8: Sorry.

[00:07:56] Speaker 9: (coughs)

[00:07:56] Speaker 7: Oh, yeah.

[00:07:57] Speaker 10: So he did give me the weather dice. (laughs)

[00:07:59] Speaker 1: I think I bought two of them. I got a, I got a... I should show you a dice I got here. Oh, can't. But, um, so it is now the 8th, which is a Saturday. Um, the 8th of Astra Orpheus. And you guys have woken up in the morning, and you've met in kind of in the mess hall of this central building, uh, to get a meal. (coughs) So, you guys are meeting. This is kind of a campfire time where you can kind of, you know, catch up with each other and anything, you know, while you're eating. Stuff like that.

[00:08:28] Speaker 12: Good morning.

[00:08:30] Speaker 7: Good morrow.

[00:08:31] Speaker 12: This is Ulric, formerly of Swan. He has a sea cart recipe.

[00:08:37] Speaker 10: Yes. The fairies are after my recipes, the bastards.

[00:08:41] Speaker 11: Wait.

[00:08:41] Speaker 10: But what is this place? This place wasn't here when I was here last.

[00:08:44] Speaker 1: I picked it up.

[00:08:45] Speaker 11: That was your character. I wasn't he-ent.

[00:08:48] Speaker 1: (laughs) Nice.

[00:08:48] Speaker 12: You, you must ask in character.

[00:08:50] Speaker 7: Seven Deadly Sins?

[00:08:52] Speaker 11: Oh.

[00:08:52] Speaker 10: Yep. I can't answer unless it's in character.

[00:08:54] Speaker 11: Well, I can't do accents, so...

[00:08:56] Speaker 10: (laughs)

[00:08:57] Speaker 8: It really is not a morning person. She will, like, get up in the morning if need be, but she is ra- more nocturnal than-

[00:09:04] Speaker 10: This is Ulric.

[00:09:05] Speaker 8: We found him.

[00:09:06] Speaker 11: Ulric.

[00:09:06] Speaker 8: We found him and bring him back to him.

[00:09:09] Speaker 11: So, you're, uh, the-

[00:09:10] Speaker 8: He was stone.

[00:09:11] Speaker 11: The um, just blanked on the name. The white-haired old dude from, uh, um-

[00:09:19] Speaker 8: Doc Brown.

[00:09:20] Speaker 11: Yeah.

[00:09:20] Speaker 8: Yep.

[00:09:20] Speaker 11: Yeah.

[00:09:21] Speaker 10: So, is this that Brown you speak of?

[00:09:22] Speaker 12: He is.

[00:09:23] Speaker 10: (laughs)

[00:09:24] Speaker 12: No. He is renowned chef of stone.

[00:09:32] Speaker 7: It's always good to have-

[00:09:34] Speaker 10: Extraordinaire.

[00:09:36] Speaker 7: It's always good to have a chef along.

[00:09:38] Speaker 10: Mm. Just wait 'til you taste my food.

[00:09:41] Speaker 11: What do you like to-

[00:09:41] Speaker 7: Look forward to it, my friend.

[00:09:42] Speaker 11: What kind of food do you make?

[00:09:44] Speaker 10: I can't tell you. It's a secret. Although the fairies will find out. (laughs)

[00:09:48] Speaker 11: Why... Wait, why can't you tell us?

[00:09:51] Speaker 7: Because the fairies will find out.

[00:09:52] Speaker 10: Yes.

[00:09:52] Speaker 7: You can never be too safe from the Fey folk.

[00:09:54] Speaker 8: I do not-

[00:09:55] Speaker 10: That's right, it's top secret. I do not-

[00:09:56] Speaker 11: What do you do to piss off the Fey folk?

[00:09:59] Speaker 10: Nothing, they just tasted my food and it was so good. They've been chasing me for... Ever since.

[00:10:04] Speaker 7: You don't have to do anything to piss off the Fey folk.

[00:10:08] Speaker 10: Mm.

[00:10:08] Speaker 7: They are tricksy. They can be your friends but-

[00:10:11] Speaker 10: Mm.

[00:10:11] Speaker 7: ... you must be very careful.

[00:10:13] Speaker 10: Very true.

[00:10:14] Speaker 12: Is, uh, um, Vidia with us?

[00:10:21] Speaker 1: What's that?

[00:10:22] Speaker 12: Was Vidia with us?

[00:10:23] Speaker 1: So, yes, you guys noticed something-

[00:10:26] Speaker 10: You'll find out.

[00:10:27] Speaker 1: ... hovering around, (clears throat) looking kind of sheepish.

[00:10:35] Speaker 12: She's hovering around Ulric?

[00:10:36] Speaker 1: Yeah, kind of hovering on Ulric at the moment.

[00:10:38] Speaker 11: Oh.

[00:10:39] Speaker 12: Maybe she's not badmouthed the Fey.

[00:10:43] Speaker 11: Nixie?

[00:10:43] Speaker 1: Um, they are common enough. This doesn't have wings, so I don't know if you guys remember which, which, um, she was.

[00:10:51] Speaker 10: I don't think I ever told us exactly what she was.

[00:10:54] Speaker 1: Uh, she-

[00:10:54] Speaker 12: The AI says she is a sprite.

[00:10:56] Speaker 1: She is a sprite. Um, fairies have-

[00:10:58] Speaker 12: I have my database so I can cheat. (laughs)

[00:11:02] Speaker 10: That's not right.

[00:11:03] Speaker 1: Um, basically, fairies have butterfly wings, uh, pixies-

[00:11:06] Speaker 12: The whole point was for you not to have to take notes.

[00:11:08] Speaker 10: Oh. (laughs)

[00:11:08] Speaker 12: (laughs)

[00:11:10] Speaker 1: Pixie, this is just general stuff, but pixies, um, have dr- dragonfly like wings.

[00:11:14] Speaker 11: Ooh.

[00:11:14] Speaker 1: And then sprites don't have wings. Um, nixies are very aquatic like. They have more like gills and fin than like grigs have, um, grasshopper type legs. Brownies look like little tiny humans, but they can't fly. They have to remain on the ground.

[00:11:29] Speaker 12: This is Vidia. She does not speak.

[00:11:33] Speaker 1: Yeah, she's just kind of doing that thing hovering around him. So Vidia, in game, is gonna be, um, she'll follow you guys. She'll get off, give off light.

[00:11:40] Speaker 11: So she's a, she is that color?

[00:11:42] Speaker 1: Oh, yeah. She looks pretty much just like this, yeah.

[00:11:44] Speaker 10: Hmm.

[00:11:45] Speaker 1: Um, she is gonna hover around the party. You guys can just indicate who you want her to hover around. She'll give off light like a fanter, like a lantern, so about 20 feet. Uh, 40, whatever that, however that exactly measures out. Um, and she also... Anytime you guys find a new item, if no one wants to hold that item, you can give it to her. She kind of has like her own little bag of holding, in a way. And she'll hold onto it. So basically-

[00:12:06] Speaker 10: A tiny little bag of holding.

[00:12:07] Speaker 1: So-

[00:12:07] Speaker 11: Does she communicate in sign language?

[00:12:09] Speaker 1: Um, she communicates in very over-exaggerated pantomime from what you can see.Um-

[00:12:16] Speaker 13: She doesn't mind.

[00:12:17] Speaker 1: You're not, probably not seeing her talk too much. She-

[00:12:19] Speaker 13: Not very well.

[00:12:21] Speaker 1: Um-

[00:12:21] Speaker 14: Yeah. Okay.

[00:12:23] Speaker 1: She's also a Fey and they don't make sense sometimes.

[00:12:24] Speaker 13: Trying to get a hold of precision times.

[00:12:27] Speaker 14: Okay.

[00:12:28] Speaker 10: She's not like, like, uh, a NPC that's gonna like, help us. Like anything like that but she's like-

[00:12:35] Speaker 13: Like there is an Orc around the corner. Nah, that ain't gonna be Yeah.

[00:12:37] Speaker 10: ... convenient.

[00:12:37] Speaker 1: She might offer hints and suggestions in her own little way but Muck it right up.

[00:12:41] Speaker 10: Warlock's up.

[00:12:43] Speaker 13: She sees danger but she's not gonna be able to communicate it well.

[00:12:46] Speaker 10: Mm.

[00:12:47] Speaker 14: Got it.

[00:12:47] Speaker 10: Or go scout for us. She's like gonna carry our crap. (laughs)

[00:12:51] Speaker 1: Basically what you do is as you guys find things-

[00:12:53] Speaker 13: Flodin's lamp might hold it.

[00:12:55] Speaker 10: (laughs)

[00:12:56] Speaker 14: Okay.

[00:12:56] Speaker 1: As you guys find things, I'll give you guys c- um, item cards. And like I said, it'll go into hers if you guys don't wanna claim it right away. If you do wanna claim it, then you have to add it to your hero lab. Um, basically how that works.

[00:13:06] Speaker 10: (coughs) Like the ring we found.

[00:13:08] Speaker 1: Yeah. Yeah, she'd be holding onto that. I don't think we have room or whatever for that.

[00:13:11] Speaker 10: No.

[00:13:12] Speaker 14: No.

[00:13:12] Speaker 1: I didn't have a card for it so I don't know.

[00:13:13] Speaker 14: Did you... What did... You guys fight goblins last week or what did you fight?

[00:13:17] Speaker 10: Well, you can ask him.

[00:13:18] Speaker 14: Oh.

[00:13:19] Speaker 10: Yes!

[00:13:20] Speaker 14: Yeah, I, I'm asking all these things in character.

[00:13:24] Speaker 10: I don't know if I can trust you. Not after what happened to me last time I trusted people. Who are you and why should I trust you? How do I know you're not a Fey in disguise?

[00:13:34] Speaker 14: Um, I'm Orillia and-

[00:13:36] Speaker 15: I pull out a chunk of cold iron and I start petting it. I am no Fey.

[00:13:41] Speaker 14: I go up and touch it.

[00:13:42] Speaker 10: How do I know that's really f- cold iron? Trust it.

[00:13:44] Speaker 14: (laughs) I go up and touch the cold iron.

[00:13:46] Speaker 10: Is it cold?

[00:13:46] Speaker 14: And nothing happens.

[00:13:47] Speaker 1: It is.

[00:13:47] Speaker 10: Mm. I don't know it's really hot or maybe it's just painted.

[00:13:52] Speaker 15: Give it a lick.

[00:13:53] Speaker 14: (laughs)

[00:13:54] Speaker 10: Okay. (laughs)

[00:13:56] Speaker 14: (laughs)

[00:13:56] Speaker 10: I like it. Mm. Tastes like iron. Okay, maybe I'll, I'll f- I might believe that. (laughs)

[00:14:02] Speaker 15: I put my chunk of cold iron back in my pouch.

[00:14:05] Speaker 10: Mm, I should get one of those.

[00:14:07] Speaker 15: You should.

[00:14:09] Speaker 14: Where did you get a chunk of cold iron?

[00:14:11] Speaker 15: I bought it as part of my starting equipment.

[00:14:13] Speaker 10: What's a chunk of cold iron even cost?

[00:14:15] Speaker 15: According to where I saw it was five gold.

[00:14:19] Speaker 10: I knew it was somewhere out there. I bought it in the past. I just don't remember what it cost. Okay.

[00:14:24] Speaker 15: I use it for my, um, my main attack.

[00:14:26] Speaker 14: Why should I trust you?

[00:14:30] Speaker 10: I didn't say you should.

[00:14:33] Speaker 15: Oh, no.

[00:14:33] Speaker 10: But I am such a good, helpful, friendly, good-looking fellow and wise, wise beyond my years.

[00:14:40] Speaker 14: For your humanity.

[00:14:41] Speaker 15: We should always respect our elders.

[00:14:43] Speaker 10: Maybe. Who's this elder as you speak of?

[00:14:46] Speaker 15: You!

[00:14:47] Speaker 10: Hm. Just a wise man, that's all.

[00:14:50] Speaker 15: (laughs)

[00:14:54] Speaker 10: Don't, kids call me old.

[00:14:56] Speaker 15: How did your day go? We unsuccessfully tried to hunt some goblins but they all ran away as soon as they saw us.

[00:15:04] Speaker 10: Ah.

[00:15:05] Speaker 15: Cowards that they were.

[00:15:08] Speaker 10: That's 'cause you didn't have mighty old Alric with you.

[00:15:13] Speaker 14: Alric, Alric spelled with a U or a A?

[00:15:16] Speaker 10: A. Alric Grimelstan Grimel.

[00:15:24] Speaker 14: Okay.

[00:15:25] Speaker 10: He's a old cranky looking dude with really like outdated, funky looking armor.

[00:15:32] Speaker 14: Okay.

[00:15:33] Speaker 10: Doesn't really fit him very well with odds and ends like attached to him. (instrumental music plays)

[00:15:39] Speaker 14: An eccentric character.

[00:15:40] Speaker 10: Mm-hmm.

[00:15:44] Speaker 15: (coughs)

[00:15:45] Speaker 14: I, uh, make an origami bird.

[00:15:47] Speaker 15: Well, how did your hunt go?

[00:15:50] Speaker 13: Complex.

[00:15:51] Speaker 10: We slew the beast!

[00:15:52] Speaker 14: I make a little origami bird cat.

[00:15:53] Speaker 10: We killed the dragon! Returned with the treasure hoard.

[00:15:57] Speaker 13: There was no dragon.

[00:15:59] Speaker 10: Sure there was.

[00:16:02] Speaker 14: (laughs)

[00:16:03] Speaker 10: Maybe you don't wanna tell them.

[00:16:04] Speaker 13: (laughs)

[00:16:06] Speaker 10: I understand. We'll keep the hoard between us.

[00:16:10] Speaker 15: The dragon makes for a good story.

[00:16:11] Speaker 10: (laughs) Better that way. That way the queen doesn't find out either.

[00:16:17] Speaker 13: Evil spiders.

[00:16:19] Speaker 10: Disguised dragons disguised as, as spiders.

[00:16:23] Speaker 15: Mm, captured them.

[00:16:24] Speaker 13: Yes.

[00:16:24] Speaker 15: Captured dryad, we freed.

[00:16:27] Speaker 14: Make a... Or did I make long-limbed spider kinda like this?

[00:16:37] Speaker 13: Mm, make a...

[00:16:39] Speaker 1: (clears throat) So you guys are able to chitchat for a little while and start talking, look around there and n-

[00:16:46] Speaker 13: And then, uh, uh, what's his name? Uh, Broldak?

[00:16:52] Speaker 1: He's-

[00:16:53] Speaker 13: Is he around to convey details or is he like sleeping it off?

[00:16:56] Speaker 1: He's kind of sleeping it off. He got back instead of going to bed early. Um, he stayed in, down talking to some of the caravan people and-

[00:17:03] Speaker 13: Yeah, he is a dwarf.

[00:17:04] Speaker 1: ... regaling them with stories of his, of the-

[00:17:06] Speaker 13: Regaling him while drinking.

[00:17:08] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[00:17:08] Speaker 10: So you never told me, how long has this bridge been here?

[00:17:12] Speaker 13: I arrived yesterday.

[00:17:14] Speaker 14: (laughs)

[00:17:14] Speaker 10: Hm.

[00:17:16] Speaker 1: You guys had probably heard-

[00:17:17] Speaker 13: Ask the captain.

[00:17:17] Speaker 1: I think, um-

[00:17:18] Speaker 10: Who?

[00:17:19] Speaker 13: Captain.

[00:17:20] Speaker 1: Yeah. See if the captain has mentioned, you'll have a chance to ask him here in advance.

[00:17:24] Speaker 13: Urka.

[00:17:26] Speaker 15: Oh, excuse me.

[00:17:27] Speaker 10: Mm.

[00:17:27] Speaker 15: (slurping) Perhaps I will.

[00:17:34] Speaker 1: So it's not too long as you guys kind of chat. It's a little while before y- a Fey comes over to see you, a little goblin. Looks like that.

[00:17:42] Speaker 10: (laughs)

[00:17:43] Speaker 1: Says, "Hiya, guys. What do you want? I can try to get anything for yous." She starts, you know, where you can get kind of hero food thing that you want.

[00:17:54] Speaker 13: I seek information.

[00:17:56] Speaker 1: Oh, Dad, I don't know if I can help you with that. Maybe. But you tell me what it is and I'll see what I can do. I knows a guy.

[00:18:04] Speaker 13: I seek information about the giant great stone statue of dwarf. Broken weapon.

[00:18:12] Speaker 14: Very nice.

[00:18:16] Speaker 10: Hmm.

[00:18:18] Speaker 16: Do you have a menu?

[00:18:18] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[00:18:19] Speaker 16: What are your prices?

[00:18:20] Speaker 1: (clears throat) She points over, there's a board and there's the basic, you know, food, um, menu up there. It's- most of it's dirt cheap. I won't mention any of the prices.

[00:18:28] Speaker 17: Tea and bacon.

[00:18:29] Speaker 1: You do notice one thing. There is what looks to be a crude drawing. Uh, it looks like a teacup with a... we assume to be a fairy sitting in it. And there's a big circle and a cross covering that.

[00:18:44] Speaker 16: Well, uh, what's in it?

[00:18:45] Speaker 17: They don't serve fairies in cups.

[00:18:46] Speaker 16: Oh, a fairy.

[00:18:47] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[00:18:49] Speaker 16: Hmm. I'll take a ham and cheese omelet-

[00:18:53] Speaker 1: To get to recreate this scene, it perhaps-

[00:18:55] Speaker 16: ... with peppers and onions.

[00:18:57] Speaker 1: Isn't what it looks like, but-

[00:18:58] Speaker 16: Hold the eggs. I had-

[00:18:59] Speaker 1: Kinda looks like that over the back. There's no fairies allowed under there.

[00:19:04] Speaker 16: Oh, okay.

[00:19:07] Speaker 1: So you can kinda guess what's happened in here in the past. So she visible? Hmm?

[00:19:15] Speaker 16: (clears throat) Is she visible? What's her name?

[00:19:17] Speaker 1: No, she's sitting on here. You mean Vidya?

[00:19:19] Speaker 16: Vidya, I'm always... Yeah, I'm gonna forget her name.

[00:19:22] Speaker 1: It's like Nvidia.

[00:19:23] Speaker 16: Yeah.

[00:19:23] Speaker 1: The GPU maker but without the "N".

[00:19:25] Speaker 16: Yes. That wasn't me.

[00:19:27] Speaker 1: She was totally visible, um, that was the fairy queen.

[00:19:31] Speaker 16: What? (laughs) That wasn't me that made that joke last week.

[00:19:33] Speaker 1: No, I'm saying that's how I remember it.

[00:19:35] Speaker 16: Oh, yeah.

[00:19:36] Speaker 1: Fair enough. (laughs) She looks like that. So that is another one of the Dramatis Persona. She'll be added to that board after tonight. Um, she introduces herself, "My name's Gaz." Um...

[00:19:50] Speaker 18: I am called Kotal.

[00:19:51] Speaker 1: "Oh, well, uh, pleased to meet ya. (dramatic music) I haven't seen your kind here before."

[00:19:54] Speaker 18: We do not come this far usually.

[00:19:58] Speaker 1: "Ah, well, you're more than welcome here. Let me know if you have any special foods you wanna eat. I think I can get it. As I said, I know the guy."

[00:20:07] Speaker 16: Does me eating an omelet offend you?

[00:20:10] Speaker 1: No.

[00:20:10] Speaker 16: Okay. Then you can give me the egg with the omelet.

[00:20:14] Speaker 1: Yeah, she'll take your order. Um, she starts, you know, running back and, um, you know, after a while brings back your guys' food. Um, she'll even say, you know, "So you guys is not with the caravan, huh? Well, I tell you what, if- if you, uh... in a few days I've gotta go deliver some supplies.

[00:20:32] Speaker 17: (laughs)

[00:20:32] Speaker 1: "Uh, you know, to the other, uh, um..." Goddamn it. They don't call themselves goblins, hobbes. Um, so basically goblin-

[00:20:44] Speaker 16: That's the civilized goblins?

[00:20:45] Speaker 1: Yeah. So basically, there's g- goblins are generally evil, sicky- um, sadistic, mean little things. Um, there are goblins that are more civilized. They've learned to kind of co-exist with civilizations. They're almost a separate species, but not quite. Um, so the more domesticated ones are known as hobbes, H-O-B-S.

[00:21:02] Speaker 16: So are there hobgoblins?

[00:21:04] Speaker 1: Yeah, there are hobgoblins, but they're different.

[00:21:06] Speaker 16: Okay. Just wondering if they're different.

[00:21:07] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[00:21:08] Speaker 16: Okay.

[00:21:08] Speaker 1: This is more like Calvin and Hobbes. I know I just had to come up with names, so...

[00:21:11] Speaker 16: That's fine.

[00:21:12] Speaker 1: I don't have to say domesticated goblin every time, because that just has the wrong connotation.

[00:21:15] Speaker 16: Yeah.

[00:21:16] Speaker 1: Um, (coughs) "But I gotta go deliver a bunch of supplies here in a few days, once the other caravan comes. I mean, I can get up to where the other hobbes lives but, uh, you know, with a bunch of supplies, I tend to get, uh, draw some unwanted attention. So maybe if yous wants to help, you can help me with that. We gotta stop at two different camps."

[00:21:34] Speaker 16: Where do they live?

[00:21:35] Speaker 1: "Oh, they're just up the river. Um, we got, uh, you know, the- the Goblin King and then, um," uh, uh, Liv? Make sure I get it right. (dramatic music)

[00:21:52] Speaker 17: Take a picture of this awesome bridge.

[00:21:53] Speaker 19: (laughs)

[00:21:54] Speaker 16: There's some on Discord.

[00:21:55] Speaker 1: Oh, Zel.

[00:21:55] Speaker 16: There's a bunch in Discord.

[00:21:56] Speaker 17: I know, but it's not the same.

[00:21:58] Speaker 16: Yeah.

[00:21:59] Speaker 17: Now I have some-

[00:22:00] Speaker 1: "Yeah, you guys would really like to meet them. They're, they're really good folks. You don't like each other none, but, uh, they're really good." (dramatic music)

[00:22:07] Speaker 16: So, if they don't like each other, why are they gonna like us?

[00:22:11] Speaker 1: "Well, because of me. I, I help both of them." "What does-"

[00:22:17] Speaker 17: And, uh-

[00:22:17] Speaker 16: "Why don't they like each other?"

[00:22:18] Speaker 1: "Well, they don't like each other on account of the fact they hate each other."

[00:22:22] Speaker 16: (laughs) Can't argue with logic like that. (laughs)

[00:22:26] Speaker 1: "But they is perfectly fine people. They just don't like each others. But they both have little goblin camps, they, they see over. There's the Goblin King. He is so... um, he's a very regal kinda guy. Um, he has royal blood in him, so people always trust what he's gots to say. And he's a really good singing and dancing type of guy. And then there's Zel. Um, we, we calls her Zel behind her back when she's not paying attention. Her actual name, um..."

[00:22:56] Speaker 16: (laughs) Zel.

[00:22:56] Speaker 17: Zel?

[00:22:56] Speaker 1: She has to pull out a little piece of paper at some point.

[00:22:59] Speaker 16: Okay.

[00:22:59] Speaker 1: "Oh, yeah, yeah, Zel. It's her-"

[00:23:01] Speaker 16: Zel, or Zell.

[00:23:02] Speaker 17: Or Booker.

[00:23:02] Speaker 16: "... her royal, her majesty, her..." She pulls out a notebook, looks at it. Um, "She is Royal Eminence and, and Imperator Zelinda, Queen of the Esseni, um, Scion of the Eldrazi, uh, Quizzurstez Haterach, um, Sixth Hokage of the, uh, Leafy Village, Duchess of Shale, Lord of the Northland, and leader of his peoples."

[00:23:25] Speaker 18: Did I hear that she is Queezatch Haterach?

[00:23:27] Speaker 19: (laughs)

[00:23:27] Speaker 1: Ah, yes. Apparently that is a title she is, um, apparently quite fond of.

[00:23:31] Speaker 16: Wow.

[00:23:31] Speaker 18: I do not believe that title can be given to a woman.

[00:23:34] Speaker 19: (laughs)

[00:23:34] Speaker 1: (coughs)

[00:23:36] Speaker 16: Has she been a Jeserit? (laughs)

[00:23:40] Speaker 1: I'll point out, all those are references. I'll be surprised if anyone can guess all of those, but...

[00:23:44] Speaker 17: I know the Eldrazi one.

[00:23:46] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[00:23:46] Speaker 16: That was from Gathering.

[00:23:48] Speaker 17: Yeah.

[00:23:49] Speaker 16: I recognize names even if I don't know all of them, like that one I did know. 'Cause I never really had that one.

[00:23:54] Speaker 1: Army of Darkness is in part of one of those.

[00:23:58] Speaker 17: Yeah.

[00:23:59] Speaker 16: Queen of Shale. What's that from?

[00:24:02] Speaker 1: It's Henry the Red, Duke of Shale, Leader of the Northland-

[00:24:06] Speaker 16: Okay. (laughs)

[00:24:07] Speaker 1: ... and ruler of his peoples. So that's Army of Darkness.

[00:24:09] Speaker 16: Yeah.

[00:24:10] Speaker 1: Queen of the Esseni, that's, um, a real life person named Boudica.

[00:24:13] Speaker 17: Oh, yeah.

[00:24:14] Speaker 16: Movie was great.

[00:24:14] Speaker 1: Um, Boudica was of the Celtish war and she's actually... there's a demigod of Celtos people, um, named Morvana. And that's, she's based off of Boudica.So, she has a lot of titles. But yeah, um, she's a real sweetheart and I'm sure you guys will love her. Um, but yeah, I gotta go deliver some supplies in a few days and, uh, you know, I'll see what I can do to make it worth your while. But, you know-

[00:24:41] Speaker 20: Hmm.

[00:24:41] Speaker 1: ... you wanna know anything, you just come see me. I'm sure I can help find stuff out for you.

[00:24:45] Speaker 21: Otongue will silently nod.

[00:24:47] Speaker 22: When you have details, let us know.

[00:24:50] Speaker 23: Happy to do it, small friend.

[00:24:52] Speaker 1: Um, she turns back and goes away to her, uh, uh, well, food and whatnot. Um, before too long, um, you guys can chat and eat. It's probably about time your food is, uh, done sir. Someone, um, steps in that you two recognize, you guys don't. A rather weird looking, well, not weird, but, um, unusual person. An elf lady dressed mostly in leaves and bark and whatnot. Her photo is actually in the top corner up there.

[00:25:20] Speaker 21: Hm.

[00:25:21] Speaker 1: She comes, recognizes you-

[00:25:22] Speaker 20: I met her.

[00:25:22] Speaker 1: ... two and sits down. And says, "Ah, it is good to see you again. I may, um... I've been having a little bit of an issue here, trying to get something for the caravan. I need some money. Um, the, uh, commander, the captain says he might have a proposition for us. Um, a matter that needs taking care of."

[00:25:41] Speaker 21: Is this Alish?

[00:25:42] Speaker 1: Alish.

[00:25:43] Speaker 21: Alish.

[00:25:43] Speaker 1: "Um, and perhaps you might be able to assist me with that."

[00:25:48] Speaker 22: Hmm. What is this task?

[00:25:49] Speaker 1: "I don't know. We'll have to ask him. He said I would have to, uh... Apparently, he didn't trust my instincts to handle this by myself. So, um, he recommended I find some folks and, um, that might be a good chance to make some money, which I desperately need."

[00:26:08] Speaker 22: Hmm.

[00:26:09] Speaker 20: (coughs)

[00:26:09] Speaker 1: (laughs)

[00:26:09] Speaker 20: I could use some money.

[00:26:10] Speaker 1: "Um, I seem to have ordered a large supply of seeds and, uh, uh, seeds mostly. Um, seeds of plant or plants. And, uh, it is quite more than I have, um, funds for."

[00:26:28] Speaker 20: Shh.

[00:26:28] Speaker 1: Being a Grove Warden is a very prestigious line of work, but it doesn't pay anything, unfortunately.

[00:26:33] Speaker 21: (laughs)

[00:26:36] Speaker 22: We, uh... Did we actually see her grove? I don't remember.

[00:26:39] Speaker 1: Yeah, you guys were in there-

[00:26:40] Speaker 22: Because we wouldn't... Okay, then.

[00:26:41] Speaker 1: ... when you guys first, um... (coughs)

[00:26:43] Speaker 22: I thought so.

[00:26:44] Speaker 1: They took you there but that's where your first time is.

[00:26:47] Speaker 21: At the tree house.

[00:26:49] Speaker 22: Oh, yeah. So the tree house is where-

[00:26:50] Speaker 1: So there's a little tree house in the-

[00:26:51] Speaker 22: Yeah, okay.

[00:26:52] Speaker 1: ... ground area is just nice, very pristine kind of, uh, um, um, glade, basically. (laughs)

[00:27:00] Speaker 20: Oh, did you tell them about we're not tracking money in the here or there but then-

[00:27:04] Speaker 1: Yeah, I haven't given you guys your coins yet. Oh, plus if someone wants to do the treasurer stuff, I can give you the coins for that. We'll get to that here in a moment. Um, but if you ask me, she goes, "Hey, to us, it looks like, uh, your ranks have grown overnight."

[00:27:18] Speaker 22: Hmm.

[00:27:19] Speaker 20: Oh, I'm still the same size.

[00:27:20] Speaker 1: I see.

[00:27:22] Speaker 20: (laughs)

[00:27:24] Speaker 1: Um-

[00:27:24] Speaker 20: Perhaps, maybe I should check. Pull out a tape measure and start measuring. Hmm, well...

[00:27:31] Speaker 21: They were on another task before you arrived.

[00:27:34] Speaker 1: Ah. "Well, perhaps you would like to join me in this as well. My name is Alish."

[00:27:38] Speaker 20: Arnor Josephson. Pleased to meet you.

[00:27:43] Speaker 1: Ah. "Um, I don't know what it is, but let me go speak to the, uh-"

[00:27:48] Speaker 20: Our scarcity is a good call.

[00:27:49] Speaker 1: Oh. (laughs) "Let me speak to the commander here, Charlie. Um, I may have a private matter, if you guys come across it. Um, old William, uh, Willy lives around here. Um, he, uh... I'm not quite sure how he, uh... There's something I would wish from him but, uh, I don't really care to talk to him. Um, I can't talk to him because I don't want to. Um, I have once and that was quite frankly more than I would want, than I should want to. Um, that old lecherous geezer is, uh, not someone I'd deal with if I didn't have to. But he has, um, apparently, grown the, or, uh, gained the ability to grow elderberries. Quite rare and not found in this area for real."

[00:28:34] Speaker 20: Mm-hmm.

[00:28:35] Speaker 1: Not sure where he got them from and I'm even more surprised that he's, has the capability of growing them. Um, I had wished to grow some in my, uh, grove, which I had originally procured from Willy. Um, sadly, the elderberries disappeared. I can only surmise that three flying little shits, uh, ran off with them. So, if you meet Willy, um, perhaps if you could discreetly procure me some elderberries, um, I'll see if I can perhaps pay you after a while. Um, obviously not with money or else I wouldn't be here asking for money to buy basic seeds myself. But I'll see if I can make it up to you somehow."

[00:29:14] Speaker 24: So she wants us to find these good berries for her?

[00:29:18] Speaker 1: Procure them discreetly.

[00:29:19] Speaker 24: Yeah.

[00:29:21] Speaker 1: From Willy, which you guys haven't met yet. But you, you guys had heard that he lives kind of in the area?

[00:29:26] Speaker 22: Um, wasn't he on that island?

[00:29:28] Speaker 1: He wasn't. Um-

[00:29:30] Speaker 21: No, that was the other guy.

[00:29:31] Speaker 22: That was the other... Oh, yeah.

[00:29:32] Speaker 21: Gribnar.

[00:29:33] Speaker 1: Gribnar. He's the...

[00:29:35] Speaker 20: That's right.

[00:29:36] Speaker 1: I didn't fully explain it but Gribnar is like one of the guys on the board up there, too. He has a fight with you guys.

[00:29:40] Speaker 21: Willy was-

[00:29:40] Speaker 22: He's the viking looking guy.

[00:29:41] Speaker 21: ... Fawn went to get Willy and failed to get him to come.

[00:29:44] Speaker 1: Yeah. Fawn came back with some fruits, though.

[00:29:47] Speaker 21: Yeah.

[00:29:47] Speaker 1: That he was happy.

[00:29:48] Speaker 22: Did you see............................ Potions.

[00:29:50] Speaker 21: Yeah.

[00:29:50] Speaker 22: Equivalent of potions. Um, how many do you need? And do they need to be fresh or do they just need the seeds?

[00:29:58] Speaker 1: Uh, as fresh as you can get. They'll probably survive the planting process. As many as you can and I'll see what I can do. I might be able to whip up a potion or two for you.

[00:30:09] Speaker 22: Hmm. We should find these. I know a good recipe for elderberry pie.

[00:30:12] Speaker 21: What's the recipe?

[00:30:14] Speaker 1: You can try, um-

[00:30:15] Speaker 22: It's secret.

[00:30:17] Speaker 1: You guys have nature, you can try it, uh, recall knowledge on. Um, I have... There's enough for each of you.

[00:30:25] Speaker 24: Yay.

[00:30:25] Speaker 1: If you don't want it.

[00:30:27] Speaker 25: Uh, I think that's all, uh, but most of it.

[00:30:30] Speaker 26: I do, I do not know.

[00:30:31] Speaker 27: 16 plus two.

[00:30:32] Speaker 25: Oh, nice.

[00:30:33] Speaker 27: Five.

[00:30:34] Speaker 1: Surprising you know-

[00:30:35] Speaker 25: Oh, 14 then.

[00:30:36] Speaker 1: ... a little bit considering that... What's that?

[00:30:37] Speaker 25: 14.

[00:30:38] Speaker 1: 14? Um, (coughs) you probably know enough that they're a pretty rare one. Um, you've probably heard of them more in legend that they're, um, they have a lot of very, um, alchemical properties. Um, they're k- kind of fairly sought after. Um, but they're very hard to grow and they only grow in certain places.

[00:31:01] Speaker 27: Okay.

[00:31:02] Speaker 1: So I'll do that for much whatever you guys can get from Old Billy. (instrumental music plays) But, um, so is there anything that you guys want to, um, more than we'll need to go down and talk to the captain and see what he has to offer?

[00:31:16] Speaker 25: After dinner so, or after le- breakfast sounds like a plan.

[00:31:18] Speaker 28: I will come. I have-

[00:31:20] Speaker 1: He will join you guys as you-

[00:31:20] Speaker 28: ... I have words for him also.

[00:31:23] Speaker 1: So he'll join you guys as you finish up eating. Um, when you're done with that, um, basically you're in the, um, central area now eating. You go up top and you see, um, uh, Irka. Irka is, again, the dwarf at the top center there. He is talking to a gentleman who looks like one of these two photos or a different one once I figure out what it looks like. Possibly this one, though I don't... He's probably a little skinnier than that. Um, he's a human. He kind of has, um... An older gentleman, white hair, actually somewhat skinny. He has kind of a very Spanish kind of look to it. If you're familiar with Man of La Mancha, imagine kind of like that. Um, um, and he's talking to, uh, Irka. Irka kind of goes, "Ah, fu- folks, uh, good to see you. Um, have you met, uh, um, Rosenkrantz here since you've come?"

[00:32:25] Speaker 25: (laughs) Rosenkran- seriously, there's a Rosenkranz who speaks for us.

[00:32:29] Speaker 28: Are you any relation to Guildenstern?

[00:32:32] Speaker 25: (laughs)

[00:32:33] Speaker 28: No, I have, we have not met.

[00:32:35] Speaker 1: He says, "Um, yes, my name is Rosenkranz. Um, my last name's, call me Rosenkranz. Uh, first name's Miguel. Um, I, uh-"

[00:32:46] Speaker 25: First name Rosen.

[00:32:47] Speaker 1: "Um, I don't know if you guys remember where he came from."

[00:32:52] Speaker 28: The ac- the, the reference-

[00:32:53] Speaker 25: Yeah.

[00:32:53] Speaker 28: ... is like the beginning of, uh, Hamlet, the guys who were digging up the grave.............................

[00:32:59] Speaker 27: Not quite in this case.

[00:33:00] Speaker 28: Not quite like that.

[00:33:00] Speaker 25: Well, there's been a number of times he's appeared.

[00:33:03] Speaker 1: You've been in two campaigns as a pattern.

[00:33:04] Speaker 28: Well, I mean-

[00:33:06] Speaker 1: He was the-

[00:33:06] Speaker 28: ... Shakespeare invented him before you guys did.

[00:33:08] Speaker 1: He was the character-

[00:33:09] Speaker 25: (laughs)

[00:33:09] Speaker 1: Well, this one is more specifically based off of the character-

[00:33:12] Speaker 27: Dude, I thought I read Hamlet in so long.

[00:33:13] Speaker 1: Um, in the first campaign, one of, one of the first ones we did. Yeah, the very first one we did where you guys were in the... This is when we did the Arcanum.

[00:33:21] Speaker 25: Yeah.

[00:33:22] Speaker 1: There was the, the-

[00:33:23] Speaker 25: The school, yep.

[00:33:23] Speaker 1: You guys were kind of kept in. There was a guy that kept you and kind of raised you and trained you. Well, didn't raise you, but he helped train you. That was Rosenkranz. And then when we did the, uh, Realm of the Frostmaiden, he was a guy you met in some of the first sessions, so he didn't do too much for the rest of the campaign.

[00:33:38] Speaker 25: Wasn't the island too? I thought he was an island one as well.

[00:33:40] Speaker 1: I can't remember if he was in that one or not. Okay, nevermind.

[00:33:43] Speaker 25: He was in the island because he was the one that sent us to the island.

[00:33:45] Speaker 1: Oh, okay, yeah.

[00:33:46] Speaker 28: In the original Shakespeare, he was a grave robber.

[00:33:48] Speaker 25: (laughs)

[00:33:49] Speaker 1: This guy might not be from the island.

[00:33:50] Speaker 25: I know-

[00:33:50] Speaker 1: Though he is, um, fairly well dressed. He's in nicer clothes. Again, it's kind of the kind of Spanish flair to him. Um-

[00:33:56] Speaker 27: Kind of a Spanish flair.

[00:33:57] Speaker 1: And yeah, he, um, has what looks like, which would be kind of a rare thing to have, like, glasses, but... And he has a lot of, like, tools, you know, like crafting tools or tinkering tools. You know, kind of like a tool belt with that kind of stuff. He says, "Yes, I have a laboratory, um, that I've recently bought. Um, if you guys, when you guys, um, arrived here, there's the bridge spanning the river, but there's a few islands nearby. Um, to the south," which is that direction.

[00:34:24] Speaker 25: (laughs)

[00:34:25] Speaker 1: Um, I'm keeping this by me by just for that reason. Um-

[00:34:29] Speaker 25: (laughs)

[00:34:30] Speaker 1: You guys can actually see, not too far away. It's a good rowboat's distance away, but there's an, a long island down there. There's a small, like, fishing hut. There's what looks to be a barracks of some sort. And then there's kind of a tall tower. Not, hmm, maybe not a wizard's tower, but a lookout tower that maybe has been converted into one. Um, and he says, "Yeah, that's my laboratory down there. Um, yeah, I came here just to get away from some things. Um, but you guys need anything, you come let me know." Um, he turns to the captain, "Yes, sorry, though, I'm not able to, uh, uh, help you out. I've got my own messes in my own place to clean up, half the messes I created. So I'll go take care of that."

[00:35:10] Speaker 25: What exactly do you research?

[00:35:11] Speaker 1: "Uh, I am, um, (clears throat) what I would probably call a mecha magician. Hmm. Means probably nothing to any of you guys."

[00:35:21] Speaker 25: Well, if you want any lessons, let me know.

[00:35:22] Speaker 27: A mech magician?

[00:35:23] Speaker 1: Mechamagician.

[00:35:24] Speaker 25: For a few coins, I'm always willing to share my knowledge.

[00:35:28] Speaker 1: Um, a brief descri-... You guys, your characters, I don't know if you really... Machinery doesn't really exist in this world at this time. Um, so when they say mecha magician, it's someone that, that creates contraptions, very da Vinci-esque, basic, you know-

[00:35:42] Speaker 28: Like a magician artificer.

[00:35:43] Speaker 1: Kind of, but maybe none of them are as advanced as they are.

[00:35:46] Speaker 28: Yeah.

[00:35:47] Speaker 1: Um, because this is still very much

[00:35:48] Speaker 29: Yeah.

[00:35:50] Speaker 1: Um, he's an old guy who found a hobby late in life you're guessing, so.

[00:35:54] Speaker 27: Okay.

[00:35:55] Speaker 1: Um, but he does appear to be of some wealth. Um, but he excuses himself. Um, he'll also be joining the board over there of your guy's Humanis Personae. Um, um, when, uh, Aelish comes in here and she says, "Um, well, Commander, I seem to have found a party who may be willing to help. Um, please, if you, uh, feel that's what you need to know, perhaps we can help you. Um, my seeds won't grow on their own, so I would like to just, you know, take care of it."Um, (coughs) Erka looks at you guys and says, "Well," as if she talked you into it. "Um, I've got a bit of a, a issue. It doesn't have to be taken care of today, but, uh, you know that old mansion upstream from here?" So I mentioned to the south, there's an island with some, um, structures on it. If you look north, it's a little ways further upstream. Um, let me see if I had a... There it is. Let me just draw it out. Maybe I... Oh, oh, no.

[00:37:02] Speaker 30: Oh, is that permanent marker?

[00:37:04] Speaker 1: No, it's been on here so long.

[00:37:05] Speaker 31: Old dry-

[00:37:06] Speaker 32: Caked on dry erase marker.

[00:37:08] Speaker 30: Yeah.

[00:37:09] Speaker 1: Write over it with the dry erase marker. Don't use the... Uh, that ruins it.

[00:37:13] Speaker 30: Oh, no?

[00:37:14] Speaker 1: The secret is to write over it with the dry erase marker and then it's written and you can wipe it off easy. Here, do you want me to-

[00:37:20] Speaker 32: Demonstrate?

[00:37:21] Speaker 1: ... while you're explaining, I can clean it up?

[00:37:23] Speaker 30: Oh, we should all just

[00:37:24] Speaker 33: (laughs).

[00:37:25] Speaker 30: Wow.

[00:37:27] Speaker 1: It kind of doesn't matter.

[00:37:28] Speaker 34: I may not use that that often.

[00:37:30] Speaker 1: Doesn't matter what the color is. It just, it magically makes it... I need a rag. Oh. Fail. Um, but if you look up this way, it's a little further up, um, upstream. You can see there's an island and there's kind of a nicer mansion that's built on.

[00:37:43] Speaker 35: (laughs) Is that an AI made picture?

[00:37:44] Speaker 1: What's that?

[00:37:45] Speaker 30: It's, uh, Erv's family portrait-

[00:37:48] Speaker 35: Oh.

[00:37:48] Speaker 30: ... on his phone.

[00:37:49] Speaker 35: (laughs)

[00:37:49] Speaker 30: (laughs)

[00:37:50] Speaker 1: It's a AI cartoonification of my wife and I.

[00:37:53] Speaker 30: Yep.

[00:37:55] Speaker 1: But, uh, that, uh, house, uh, the commander who preceded me, um, he was, uh, around when these structures were built. Uh, he must've been a fair amount of wealth himself and-

[00:38:07] Speaker 30: And when was that anyway?

[00:38:09] Speaker 1: Oh, the, the houses? Oh, they were built around-

[00:38:12] Speaker 30: Yeah, there's new development around here.

[00:38:14] Speaker 1: They were built over the course of the last 20 years. Mostly they were finished off in about, um, about seven, eight years ago they were finished.

[00:38:23] Speaker 35: Who are the builders?

[00:38:24] Speaker 1: And this was... What's that?

[00:38:25] Speaker 35: Who are the builders?

[00:38:27] Speaker 1: Oh, the, the consortium. Consortium. Um, which is a collection of people from the Iron Kingdoms, the dwarves on both sides and the Jade Kingdoms. Basically, they kind of bankrolled getting the road built and then they also, they kind of get together and, uh, fund some of the guards. And basically what they're, the hope of this consortium is, is that this will become a viable trade route. So for now, they're investing money in trying to get it up, running and, you know, get safe caravans going back and forth. Um, but it's a loose collection. It's not really a ominous organization. But yeah, I mean, the, the bridge itself was probably built about 40 years ago and about 20 years ago they started building new structures. Got finished about the last seven or eight years ago. But the commander had been here around the time. He helped oversee them being built, um, but, uh, the mansion was built here at the same time. He, uh, uh, about two, three years ago got sick. Uh, headed back west, uh, to, um, uh, the Iron Kingdoms.

[00:39:29] Speaker 30: West.

[00:39:30] Speaker 1: Yeah. I switched where it is.

[00:39:32] Speaker 30: Yeah.

[00:39:32] Speaker 1: So, yeah. By the way, this also gets that way is now west. Um, he headed back west to the Iron Kingdoms and he's, uh... I heard he passed away, uh, by word of mouth. But, uh... Oh, I just can't do my dwarven accent today. But, um, I, we've had word that, uh, new people have bought, uh, have bought the, uh, house. The house kind of went back into the... Was controlled by the consortium. Um, we've just kept, you know, it up and in shape for the last few years. Um, but, uh, and this caravan is coming to us. So there's a caravan here that's heading west. There's another caravan coming east which will be here in a few days. And I've heard the people that have bought the, uh, house are here. They have sent forward a request to make sure that the house has been cleared of any, uh, things, uh, that may have entered in. Uh, monsters, uh, and other stuff. Whatever else. We've seen some activity in the island that was recent. Now this is the, um... It's a little ways away.

[00:40:38] Speaker 30: What exactly are they planning to do with this house?

[00:40:41] Speaker 1: Live there. Um, so it's a-

[00:40:44] Speaker 30: Perhaps it's finders, keepers. Possession is 10/11ths of the law.

[00:40:53] Speaker 1: So you can see. So where you guys are at here, you have a bridge. Um, a little ways upriver is where this other island is located. One that's a little bit closer to you is down... And there's actually, this actually opens up. There's kind of a lake area here. This house is in kind of a area here and there's a big waterfall not too far upstream from where the house is. But it's a little bit more of a-

[00:41:24] Speaker 34: (coughs)

[00:41:24] Speaker 1: It is a road war-

[00:41:25] Speaker 34: (laughs)

[00:41:25] Speaker 1: A road wide, but it's, uh, a little further upstream.

[00:41:29] Speaker 32: This is how far away?

[00:41:30] Speaker 1: I mean, you have to hop in a rowboat and it's, um, I mean, probably a good maybe quarter mile, half mile. I don't think that may be quite half, but it's gonna be a little bit of a road to get there, but you can get there without too much trouble.

[00:41:42] Speaker 34: (coughs)

[00:41:43] Speaker 1: And you can see it. From the bridge, you can actually see it pretty fairly well. There's a lot of mist and stuff on the river at certain times of day that makes it obscure sometimes.

[00:41:52] Speaker 30: Oh, I see. Especially 'cause of the waterfall next to it.

[00:41:55] Speaker 1: Yeah. It's a little ways behind it, but it's fairly nearby. Once I get the actual world map up and figured out, you'll get a better look at it.

[00:42:02] Speaker 30: (laughs)

[00:42:04] Speaker 1: But they've asked that someone come clear it out before they come. But no, the guards are all too busy with everything else, so, um, they have offered, uh, some money if you guys could go and just make sure it's clean and emptied out. Um, you don't necessarily have to do it today, but definitely before they arrive in, um... Uh, today's the, as I said, the 8th of Astra Orpheus. He figures they may be here around the, um, anywhere from the 13th... Well, I'd say 12th to the 14th is what he's kind of expecting them.So-

[00:42:35] Speaker 36: Well-

[00:42:35] Speaker 1: ... if you guys can, they'll... And they said if there's any junk left over by the prior people, you're more than welcome to have it. Uh, they want the house in good shape, but, uh, they don't seem to care about anything that got left behind.

[00:42:44] Speaker 36: What kind of shape is the house in now?

[00:42:46] Speaker 1: Uh, pretty good, I'd say. Um, some of the, uh, guards here have... In the last year or two, we've sent them up there.

[00:42:54] Speaker 37: My guess is it's a haunted and they don't want it haunted.

[00:42:57] Speaker 38: I've heard tales that this house is, uh, not in very good shape anymore and that there's scorch marks all over it. (laughs)

[00:43:05] Speaker 1: But the, the downside is we don't let the, uh, guards live up there.

[00:43:08] Speaker 37: I- would I have heard about this house?

[00:43:10] Speaker 1: Nope. You guys have seen it. You guys... I mean, almost none of you guys would know anything about this area, but... Um, we would... Used to let the guards up there a little bit, but, uh, you give the guards some free space and some beer and... Well, it becomes something of a little... A wee bit of a frat house, so we don't allow them up there unless they are, uh-

[00:43:30] Speaker 38: Hmm.

[00:43:31] Speaker 1: ... on kind of a tight leash.

[00:43:32] Speaker 39: Well, I'm willing to go inspect the scorch from... Burn marks on the house, see, uh, what kind of condition it's in for ya.

[00:43:39] Speaker 1: But yeah, he says you guys want to do that.

[00:43:41] Speaker 37: Just making sure.

[00:43:41] Speaker 39: Check the rubble out.

[00:43:44] Speaker 1: Uh-

[00:43:44] Speaker 39: Sounds like a fun jolt.

[00:43:47] Speaker 1: So yes, um, do that when they come up here. You can meet them and, uh, yeah, I'm sure they'll be willing to pay you, um, at least for getting that much done. It could be a good introduction tool. If there's someone wealthy enough who had bought that house, um, that might be a boon. Um, it can be hard enough keeping this place funded and whatnot, so having some folks with some money nearby, um, in our good graces-

[00:44:09] Speaker 37: (coughs)

[00:44:09] Speaker 1: ... could definitely help out here at the Crossing.

[00:44:12] Speaker 39: (coughs)

[00:44:14] Speaker 1: But, uh, he says that's, you know, all I have for you. Uh, one other wee note, a few other. Um, since you're here, um, you're... We'll move you guys' resting accommodations to the roof of this particular inn and save the other inns for, uh, uh... The other inns and hostels for the caravans. Can't say you'll sleep much better, but, uh, perhaps a little bit. It's, um, still quite cramped up there, but much better than nothing.

[00:44:44] Speaker 40: Our thanks.

[00:44:45] Speaker 39: A fine thought, my lady, um, or my man.

[00:44:48] Speaker 1: This is, uh, the dwarf.

[00:44:49] Speaker 39: Yeah, sorry.

[00:44:50] Speaker 36: (laughs)

[00:44:50] Speaker 39: I get confused for a minute.

[00:44:52] Speaker 1: He does say, um-

[00:44:53] Speaker 39: You know dwarves, you never can tell. (laughs)

[00:44:54] Speaker 1: Well, you ha- you have a lady with you, um, 'cause Alish is still there, so... Um, the only thing I think I might have forgotten to mention the other day... Um, we are, as you guys have seen, in a very dangerous and, uh, hostile environment here. Even though we have some relative safety here on the bridge, doesn't mean that, uh, it doesn't find us from time to time. Um, so in the event that there is any, uh, trouble or danger, um, it does go to all hands on deck, um, whether you're paid to be a guard, caravan worker or waiter or cook or anything else like that. Um, so if danger arises, um, everyone has to help out in the defense of this place. That's just an assumption, but I thought I should let you know.

[00:45:39] Speaker 38: Fair enough.

[00:45:42] Speaker 1: But, uh, it was nicely seeing you guys here. It's been a... Last few years have been sort of thin. We just had the, uh, town's, uh, the guards trying to keep us, uh, safe, not really having what else we could do. We had miscellaneous tasks for us, so be happy to hear to see what you can do. But I'll leave you be. I've got more than enough stuff for meself to take care of.

[00:46:04] Speaker 40: Commander.

[00:46:05] Speaker 1: What? Hi.

[00:46:06] Speaker 40: May we speak privately?

[00:46:08] Speaker 1: Oh, definitely.

[00:46:10] Speaker 36: Can you? Can you speak privately?

[00:46:17] Speaker 38: I don't understand.

[00:46:17] Speaker 40: He said may.

[00:46:18] Speaker 36: Oh, okay.

[00:46:19] Speaker 1: (laughs)

[00:46:19] Speaker 40: (laughs)

[00:46:20] Speaker 1: So-

[00:46:21] Speaker 36: I didn't hear this.

[00:46:21] Speaker 1: And depending on what you want to do, if you want either, um... If it's specific questions you can... If you want them more private, too, I can... You can... Okay.

[00:46:27] Speaker 40: Oh, I just... In-

[00:46:27] Speaker 36: Well, let's go talk to him then.

[00:46:28] Speaker 40: In character care. Um, the players can hear, but I...

[00:46:32] Speaker 36: Mm-hmm. Yes, let's go talk to him privately then.

[00:46:34] Speaker 40: I need... I need, I need to ask him questions privately.

[00:46:37] Speaker 36: Right, let's go.

[00:46:38] Speaker 40: You-

[00:46:39] Speaker 37: Not you.

[00:46:39] Speaker 40: You may not come.

[00:46:40] Speaker 37: You're not included in the conversation he wants to have.

[00:46:44] Speaker 36: Damn kids. Fine, be that way.

[00:46:47] Speaker 1: (laughs)

[00:46:49] Speaker 40: Uh, Commander, I, uh, I seek information. I have come here because in my homeland I have found... Discovered a large statue of a dwarf, perhaps six or seven stories tall. Inside, there were ruins that had led me here. I am curious if you have heard of anything such as this and would know where I could find more information.

[00:47:14] Speaker 1: Uh, he says, I... Where are you again from?

[00:47:16] Speaker 39: (coughs)

[00:47:17] Speaker 1: Um-

[00:47:18] Speaker 40: I will..........................

[00:47:19] Speaker 1: Yeah. Um, he says, I, I can't say I know much about there. Um, there, I... There's, there's dwarven, uh, ruins. Um, I don't know of many around this area, but I've never heard of one that tall. Six or seven stories, you say? That's, uh, quite large.

[00:47:35] Speaker 40: It had, it had a broken weapon.

[00:47:37] Speaker 1: Oh.

[00:47:37] Speaker 40: Very strange.

[00:47:39] Speaker 1: Um-

[00:47:39] Speaker 40: You find it intrigues me and I seek more information.

[00:47:43] Speaker 1: Well, uh, could be something here, but yeah, nothing that I'm aware of. Um, you can ask around to some of the other folks, um...

[00:47:49] Speaker 40: Have you heard of any dwarven craftsmen in the general area? Not necessarily at the Crossing, but-

[00:47:56] Speaker 1: Uh, pretty much everyone here that, uh... We have some folks that live nearby, but, uh, none of them have really survived. Pretty much everyone either lives on the Crossing or right by it. Um, there's, um, you know, a few who live outside. Um, there was a farm, uh, stead nearby that tried to get a farm, but I think they're all dead now. Um, there's an old crazy coot that, uh... Kook who lives, uh, in the forest relatively close. I'm surprised he's still alive. Um, yeah, the only one I know of that, uh, doesn't live on the bridge is, uh, Alish. But, uh-

[00:48:35] Speaker 41: She lives in some sort of enchanted glade. Uh, she'll probably be dead soon too.

[00:48:39] Speaker 42: (coughs) Well, if you think of anything or you hear of anything, I would be grateful if you would relay that to me.

[00:48:46] Speaker 1: Hmm. Obviously, we Dwarves are interested in reclaiming a bit of our own legacy. If you find anything, let me know. I should be more than, um, (clears throat) interested to see if you find anything, especially something like that.

[00:48:56] Speaker 42: Of course.

[00:48:56] Speaker 1: Granted, um, uh, not saying there couldn't be something, nothing that I know of, but, uh, the bridge was built but the only exploration went right here along the road, immediately in the area of the road and the bridge. They didn't explore any further. So, most of the areas you're seeing hasn't been explored by, um, at least an intelligent person for as long as I can remember. I don't think in recorded history.

[00:49:20] Speaker 42: Well-

[00:49:20] Speaker 1: Well, you could ask the, uh, the Jade Kingdoms used to send expeditions up here.

[00:49:25] Speaker 42: Well, I have taken it as a personal quest. I will be happy to share what I find.

[00:49:30] Speaker 1: All right. You know, if I hear anything, I'll let you know as well.

[00:49:33] Speaker 42: Right. Thank you for your time.

[00:49:36] Speaker 1: So, basically, um, now I mentioned this. This is in the house rule. I don't know if you guys caught that or remember it. Every week, you guys do have to spend at least two downtime days, um, where basically your characters will go nuts at some, some point. So to put it in perspective-

[00:49:51] Speaker 42: Hmm.

[00:49:51] Speaker 1: ... you guys, um-

[00:49:54] Speaker 43: Everybody needs a weekend.

[00:49:55] Speaker 1: Yeah. Now, you don't have to do the-

[00:49:57] Speaker 43: Can't work seven days a week.

[00:49:58] Speaker 44: Nope.

[00:49:59] Speaker 1: Whether or not-

[00:50:00] Speaker 43: Sorry, man.

[00:50:00] Speaker 1: ... you guys will start facing exhaustion, but basically it's, um, every week, uh, that's why I have a calendar so we can track which days you guys are taking off. But if you look at it, you guys were on the road for almost two weeks. Now you're here, then you fought some goblins. So-

[00:50:12] Speaker 43: Conveniently.

[00:50:12] Speaker 1: ... we're, uh-

[00:50:13] Speaker 43: Ready for some downtime.

[00:50:14] Speaker 1: Yeah, ready for some downtime. So if you guys want to take a day or two, he doesn't need, um, you to do anything.

[00:50:20] Speaker 42: (coughs)

[00:50:21] Speaker 1: Um, he does need this house taken care of for another few days, so. And you guys, again, you've been on the road, you've been, been in combat, out on patrol for a whole day. You're probably at that point of just being exhausted and just wanting to get away. So you do have the rest of today, and you could take another day or two if you want to also. So you say basically what you'll do is you can just say one thing that you wanna do. Um, it's a little bit of exploration, or explanation here. You're gonna go around talking to people. I'll introduce some of the people that you'll meet here in a second. Um, but you can also name one specific activity you wanted to. Um, so the Doranis Personae are gonna be the more important characters. You could choose to, uh, to spend some time with them and hang out and do whatnot. Um, depending upon what activity you choose you want to do with them, um, there's kind of a skill check involved. If you pass, um, you might learn something about them. So there's room on there under each of them. Um, they're each gonna have like a, I'll, I'll get their names up in, uh, one of... But they each have about 18 different things, um, well, technically 19. Um, so once you've spent some time with them, if you pass your check, then you have a chance of learning one of those, uh, things, or you will learn one of those 19 things about them. Um, that sounds like kind of a lie. So there's two things you're gonna get the first few times. You talk to them, they're gonna get those automatically. They definitely ask you something random. It could be something they like, something they dislike. It could be languages they could teach you, it could be skills they could teach you. Um, as I mentioned, in the future you're gonna have the ability where you can be taught a language or you can learn, um, uh, they can technically teach you a, uh, um, a feat, the, uh, what are those called? The second level ones. Archetype feat. So it's a way you can earn one for your archetype feats, um, which we'll get to a little bit... That won't be until like, what, like around third level, but that is coming up. So, with each of the NPCs there, of the major Doratis Personae, um, right now you're indifferent, your statuses with them. But, um, starting around third level, you can try to, um, upgrade the status with one of them to, um, a friend. And then after that to, like, um, friend, ally, and then, like, um, battle brother or something like that. You know what I mean?

[00:52:27] Speaker 43: BFF.

[00:52:28] Speaker 1: Three tiers BFF, if you want.

[00:52:30] Speaker 43: (laughs)

[00:52:30] Speaker 1: Um, something kind of like that. Um, and doing so will have certain benefits. Um, at first level, they, they'll be willing to teach you stuff when they're a friend. They might be willing to train stuff. Um, as you get to higher levels, they might be willing to do more stuff, uh, for you or, um, whatnot. So, um, so you guys do have some time now. Today you can spend some time exploring. If you do want to hang out with one of the NPCs or each other, or just go fishing. You can pick whatever you want to do. Um, we'll be taking downtime days quite a bit, so, and there, there really isn't a timer on this campaign so much. Um, maybe towards the end a little bit. But I want you guys to feel free... You don't have to take two days a week if you want to take four days a week and just spend something... But the one thing about downtime days, though, is you can't be doing class related things. So if y- you guys did want to, um, switch your runes over, you wouldn't be able to do that on a downtime day, 'cause a downtime day is supposed to be that day where you're not doing anything and you're just relaxing and not doing chores or working something. It's like repairing shields, switching runes, stuff like that. But if you want to, you can pay someone to do it, um, or if you want to take an extra day to do that, you could also. And this is the beginning of this week, so you still have seven days to pick two days you want to do something on. So kind of go around, see if you have any things you want to n- initially do, or people you want to talk to and listen in. So we'll start over.

[00:53:50] Speaker 43: My miscellaneous activities, I will spend... I mean, I would like to, like, generally meet people, talk to people, and we'll probably spend some time... Oh, whichever is the more active tavern. They have a common room, you said, in one of the buildings, um, where the drinking occurs.

[00:54:07] Speaker 1: And this one is kind of the closest thing there is to a tavern.

[00:54:09] Speaker 43: I would probably approach the-

[00:54:11] Speaker 1: That'd be more like a cafe.

[00:54:12] Speaker 43: ... proprietor and ask if they would mind if I occasionally played my lute, 'cause I enjoy it. But my main thing is I would like to find Linn and get to know him more.

[00:54:23] Speaker 1: Okay. Um-

[00:54:25] Speaker 43: Share stories.

[00:54:25] Speaker 1: Yeah, so we can do that and then if you want to spend your first day with Linn, um-

[00:54:29] Speaker 43: Yeah.

[00:54:29] Speaker 1: ... we can do that. So-

[00:54:30] Speaker 43: I just probably won't spend 12 full hours with Linn, so-

[00:54:33] Speaker 1: Oh, no.

[00:54:33] Speaker 43: The rest of the time, we'll be talking to people and, you know, spending some time playing the lute.

[00:54:38] Speaker 1: What friends Linn with?So Lyn is the second guy up top there.

[00:54:42] Speaker 45: Oh.

[00:54:42] Speaker 1: He's the old gentleman.

[00:54:43] Speaker 45: Oh, okay.

[00:54:43] Speaker 46: Young guy.

[00:54:44] Speaker 1: Um, I think it's Lyn Chong, but, uh, he just goes by Lyn a lot.

[00:54:47] Speaker 45: Oh, okay. I thought you meant like Lynn, like the woman Lynn.

[00:54:49] Speaker 1: (laughs)

[00:54:50] Speaker 46: Okay.

[00:54:51] Speaker 1: Um, he's, he's named after something. Uh, I don't think anyone will get it, but um... Um, so yeah. Um, so what just kinda do of his real quick. Um, so yeah, I mean they say in here, they say it's your, you know, if you want to. You meet the guy who, uh, runs the place. He's... Kinda looks a lot like this. I haven't got a good photo for him yet.

[00:55:10] Speaker 47: Hm.

[00:55:11] Speaker 48: (laughs) Oh, let me check. The, the-

[00:55:11] Speaker 1: He, he's a bit of a big guy who has a really high-pitched voice. Like, "Oh, hi. Um, yeah, if, if you wanna play, uh, music here you're more than welcome to."

[00:55:21] Speaker 47: Like, "Don't want to offend your patrons."

[00:55:23] Speaker 1: "Ah, I think, uh, music is rare. Um, yeah, you're more than welcome to." Beyond that, he doesn't seem to say much. You didn't seem very... His charisma score is probably in the negatives, so he doesn't really... He says it's okay. Um, then you're able to spend some time with Lyn, um, throughout the day. You do see that Lyn, um... You learn that he's, um, got at least a sleeping place in here. You could afford a sleeping place, uh, in the, uh, main thing over there. He's on the east side of the, uh, cavern. Not too far away. Um, if you go with him, you notice he started to build a, uh, um... There was an old shrine that looked to be here. Um, very, um, eastern. Almost kind of like a Buddhist house type shrine, um, that had been built here once before. Um, just a little ways in- inland from here. You know, it did have a wall. Um, it's been abandoned. No one, no one's been paying attention to it for apparently quite some time. But if you go out there with him, you, you see it's kind of his purpose. He's just been slowly breaking and trying to clean it up and whatnot. Um, if there's a specific, um, thing or you'd like to... What is it with a shrine?

[00:56:33] Speaker 47: Now I just want to like, establish a basic relationship.

[00:56:38] Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

[00:56:38] Speaker 47: Tell stories. I'm curious about his history, his past, why he's here.

[00:56:42] Speaker 1: clears throat]

[00:56:43] Speaker 47: I will share stories of my, um, of my journey.

[00:56:48] Speaker 1: Oh. Yeah, he'll go over things a little bit with you. Um, what'll appear on his thing since you've spent some time with him is, um... So one of the first two things you're gonna learn is that they have an area of expertise, and then they have something that they're, uh, service, uh, something they're able to offer if you're level as a friend, friend or hiker with them. Right now, um, you would learn that his areas of expertise, um, is particularly like, um, anything tied to the Jade Kingdoms. Um, and you know, pretty, like, societal things tied to the Jade Kingdoms, um. As well that. Um, so, uh, for, um, Aldric, anything he'd wanna do throughout the day?

[00:57:22] Speaker 45: Uh, well first I would try to figure out how long I was petrified. So I would probably search out to the captain since he seems to know the most about the bridge and how long it's been.

[00:57:36] Speaker 1: Um, yeah, you do go, um... If you go and talk to him and question him for a little while, you probably would find out that, um... I mean, by my estimation, probably somewhere around 150.

[00:57:47] Speaker 45: Okay.

[00:57:47] Speaker 1: 130 to 150 years, depending upon... So quite a while.

[00:57:52] Speaker 45: I'm assuming there's a standard calendar year, so maybe-

[00:57:53] Speaker 1: Yeah. For the most part. Um, you'd probably guess it's close to 150.

[00:57:57] Speaker 45: Okay. Uh, after that, I would go wandering around and start taking random measurements of the bridge.

[00:58:03] Speaker 1: (laughs)

[00:58:04] Speaker 45: And then go seek out Rosencrantz and, and impart some of my, uh, knowledge on him.

[00:58:09] Speaker 1: Yeah, you can... I mean, you go around, you do meet a few people as you're exploring the bridge. Um... Oh, you know, I didn't print them off. What do you know? Um... There is a captain of the guard, um, who is, uh, this per- this model here, um, and his daughter, um, who are both living up here. He's kind of the, he's kind of like the number two over the, uh, bridge, and his, his daughters just come up with him. Um, he oversees like, the directly, the soldiers that are here too.

[00:58:39] Speaker 45: Mm-hmm.

[00:58:40] Speaker 1: Um, but yeah, then if you go to talk to Rosencrantz, you can also just spend the rest of the day with him if you want to.

[00:58:45] Speaker 45: Yeah.

[00:58:45] Speaker 1: You get to know him a little bit. Um, you find his area, kind of area of interest... You would kind of pick up that, um, Rosencrantz, it doesn't sound immediately familiar to you, but you get that he's probably of a noble family. Um, he, yeah, he kind of is, um... His laboratory as much been called, is full of very da Vinci-esque, um, type little creations. Um, where he's just almost a phenomenally basic understanding of gears and whatnot, and he kind of just tinkers away with that.

[00:59:15] Speaker 45: I'll impart some w- uh, wisdom on him.

[00:59:18] Speaker 1: (laughs)

[00:59:19] Speaker 45: 'Cause, uh, of course he doesn't know nearly as much as I do.

[00:59:22] Speaker 1: All right.

[00:59:23] Speaker 45: On mechanics and whatnot.

[00:59:25] Speaker 1: Uh, so right after you spend the day with him, you kind of pick up like, his first thing, his areas of expertise. Um, he does know a lot about arcane, um, wizardry, as well as he also has society, um... In the, uh, Iron Kingdoms he'd be pro- uh, fairly... He'd be decent at. He doesn't seem to have much of an interest in that. Um, really, I actually, no, I'd go as far as say his would be arcane knowledge. Um, wizardry, um, any there down to alchemy, potions, all that fun stuff is kind of in his domain.

[00:59:54] Speaker 45: Okay.

[00:59:54] Speaker 1: Um, so Aurelia, anything you wanna do for the day?

[00:59:58] Speaker 49: Uh, well, depending on how-

[01:00:00] Speaker 46: Are those the pictures from the first game?

[01:00:01] Speaker 49: ... what I know how, like, how many blood tokens I have.

[01:00:04] Speaker 1: Oh, yeah. I ain't got those in. Um, go ahead and roll like, um... I'm gonna do 3D6.

[01:00:12] Speaker 45: I don't know something, right?

[01:00:15] Speaker 50: (dice shaking)

[01:00:17] Speaker 46: We should try and find out what it is first.

[01:00:19] Speaker 48: Twelves.

[01:00:19] Speaker 46: I mean, we know out of character.

[01:00:20] Speaker 45: I thought we knew our characters.

[01:00:21] Speaker 46: I thought you found it out.

[01:00:22] Speaker 1: Yeah. What's that?

[01:00:24] Speaker 48: 12.

[01:00:25] Speaker 1: Oh, oh. That's when you figured it out.

[01:00:26] Speaker 46: We should set it. (dice shaking) Just go to have a maximum there.

[01:00:32] Speaker 49: I mean, if I would be needing any, I would probably go try to replenish it somehow.

[01:00:38] Speaker 1: I mean, you can get like, for um, depending on what you're looking at doing, um... There you go. Um, kind of depends, um-Like, you know you could probably talk to the cook and whatnot, and they butcher stuff all the time.

[01:00:55] Speaker 51: Mm-hmm.

[01:00:55] Speaker 1: They could probably save some blood for you. But that's like lesser, minor creatures. You don't get much of a boost from that. And it c- like, from them, it won't raise it past five, I think I said.

[01:01:05] Speaker 51: Yeah.

[01:01:05] Speaker 1: But if you are loo- you could look for other creatures, um, or you think there may be other opportunities as you-

[01:01:10] Speaker 51: If I add 12, is that, like, what I rolled, would be what I would be at?

[01:01:13] Speaker 1: Currently, yeah. So that's how much you have. Each night there, or each, beginning of each morning, you just turn it over. So you're sitting on quite a few right now.

[01:01:19] Speaker 51: Okay.

[01:01:19] Speaker 1: Good, good day's chunk, but... And then yeah, if you go find something-

[01:01:23] Speaker 52: There was plenty of slaughter on the way here. (laughs)

[01:01:27] Speaker 51: It's fair.

[01:01:27] Speaker 1: There'll be, there'll be plenty of opportunities, I think. I don't think it'll be a huge issue. It's more of a role-playing fun.

[01:01:32] Speaker 51: Your characters don't know anything.

[01:01:34] Speaker 1: Yeah, you guys don't know. Sleep soundly.

[01:01:37] Speaker 53: I know everything.

[01:01:38] Speaker 1: (laughs)

[01:01:40] Speaker 54: Do you, though?

[01:01:42] Speaker 1: Um, but yeah, is there someone-

[01:01:43] Speaker 53: Hell yeah. (laughs)

[01:01:44] Speaker 1: ... someone that you wanna spend time with or something, activity you wanna do?

[01:01:47] Speaker 51: Uh-uh.

[01:01:47] Speaker 1: You don't necessarily have to fuck with her, just do what people... Like so you could just say, "I wanna go fishing today," or whatnot, and just kind of role-play fun stuff.

[01:01:54] Speaker 51: If there's any, like, artistic person, she'd probably talk with them. Like if anyone does any type of craft or anything like that.

[01:02:03] Speaker 1: You can bump around and talk to folks. You don't immediately, um... Me, I'm trying to think if any other characters that are really strong.

[01:02:16] Speaker 51: Since she does, like, origami as a hobby, just she's just curious, so um...

[01:02:22] Speaker 1: I mean, if Gaz sees you doing that, Gaz the little goblin, um, she is-

[01:02:26] Speaker 53: He's way too young.

[01:02:27] Speaker 1: She would be, uh-

[01:02:27] Speaker 53: (laughs)

[01:02:28] Speaker 1: ... maybe not necessarily artistic, but she's amused by things like that.

[01:02:31] Speaker 53: Yeah.

[01:02:31] Speaker 55: Decided to check people. (laughs)

[01:02:33] Speaker 1: But yeah, I mean, if I was to spend some time with her, you know, when she's not busy serving, she's kind of a, she knows a ton of stuff about here if she knows a guy. Um, as a matter of fact, um, one of the things you learn about her-

[01:02:45] Speaker 52: This is really good.

[01:02:45] Speaker 1: ... if you spend a day with her is that her area of expertise, um, it's kinda like, it's not Tigris Crossing itself, but she knows all the little hobbes in the area. And hobbes are goblins and they-

[01:02:56] Speaker 53: Yeah.

[01:02:57] Speaker 1: ... they're kind of the bottom rung of society, but they tend to be widespread, so they had to be really good at picking them off.

[01:03:02] Speaker 53: Basically, yeah. (laughs) Comme la vie, though.

[01:03:04] Speaker 51: They'd probably spend time-

[01:03:05] Speaker 53: She's pretty confident where it's like lugging a ton tied to my 10-foot pole.

[01:03:08] Speaker 51: ... with her 'cause they know-

[01:03:08] Speaker 53: That was it. (laughs)

[01:03:10] Speaker 51: ... how like knows about like some about being not from around. Yeah.

[01:03:16] Speaker 1: Yeah, she knows all the ins and outs and goings on.

[01:03:18] Speaker 51: Yeah.

[01:03:19] Speaker 1: Not of Tigris Crossing itself, which is quite a bit, but especially she has rumors of all sorts from the goblins in the area.

[01:03:23] Speaker 51: She... Yeah, I'd, I really would-

[01:03:25] Speaker 1: You realize if you guys wanna find something in this immediate area, um, she probably has a weird way of knowing about it.

[01:03:30] Speaker 51: I really would spend time with her.

[01:03:32] Speaker 1: Okay. And then last but not least, I mean you had mentioned one thing, you do notice another lady, um, uh, yeah. Looks like that and she is a fairly tall Norn woman. Um, so you would see her, um, in and about. She also stays in one of the caverns. Her, you would also just find out she's in there by asking. Her name is Sigrid. Um, she is a, um, lesser dramatis persona. She's not one of the major ones.

[01:04:01] Speaker 51: Okay. Uh, so Arnor would spend the day, or at least a good chunk of the day, uh, knitting, sitting in one of the common rooms just observing people, um, trying to gather information-

[01:04:18] Speaker 52: Listening to music.

[01:04:20] Speaker 51: What?

[01:04:20] Speaker 52: Listening to good music.

[01:04:21] Speaker 51: Listening to good music and attempting to gather information to see if he notices anyone part of a mystery cult or other secret society. (laughs) Specifically, he's trying to find out if there's a witch coven in the area that he needs to, uh-

[01:04:39] Speaker 53: Ah, it's a witch! (laughs)

[01:04:40] Speaker 51: ... that he needs to acknowledge, uh, so that he doesn't step on any toes.

[01:04:45] Speaker 53: Do they have large scales-

[01:04:46] Speaker 1: You could use diplomacy to gather information throughout the day if you want.

[01:04:48] Speaker 51: Uh, I have schools in secrets.

[01:04:50] Speaker 53: Oh.

[01:04:51] Speaker 51: For something like this, I can use, uh, occultism instead of diplomacy.

[01:04:55] Speaker 1: (laughs)

[01:04:57] Speaker 53: Occultism, you and your occultism. (laughs)

[01:05:00] Speaker 51: (laughs) I didn't set out to make another occult character, but here I am. (laughs)

[01:05:07] Speaker 53: You know, this is the perfect location to build a nice scale and see if-

[01:05:11] Speaker 51: 17, she has seven.

[01:05:12] Speaker 53: ... she floats or he floats-

[01:05:13] Speaker 51: 18, four.

[01:05:13] Speaker 53: ... or that's, you can see if he's a witch.

[01:05:15] Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, it is pretty high.

[01:05:16] Speaker 53: (laughs)

[01:05:17] Speaker 1: Um, you don't really detect-

[01:05:18] Speaker 53: Make a science on that.

[01:05:18] Speaker 1: ... any signs what you're seeing here. You do notice as you're going through, um, it's never tied to occultism, but as you're walking through, you do see there's a box, a type box on this that's built into the structure here.

[01:05:30] Speaker 51: Mm-hmm.

[01:05:31] Speaker 1: Um, that is a, uh, basically an offering shrine to Hades.

[01:05:34] Speaker 51: Mm.

[01:05:34] Speaker 1: Hades is not worshiped as a god, but he's like the purveyor of the undead. So people will leave coins here, basically hoping that he'll take care, he'll usher their deceased ones or they're leaving coins hoping that if they die, he takes care of them, stuff like that.

[01:05:48] Speaker 53: (laughs)

[01:05:48] Speaker 1: Really, it's the Church of Pharasma that actually kinda upkeeps it there. Um, Hades doesn't have very followers, but, uh, that's, uh... But as far as things in the area-

[01:05:57] Speaker 54: (sneezes)

[01:05:57] Speaker 1: ... like you don't really detect much. Um, it seems like outside of this area, there really isn't anyone. Um, about the only real few nutjobs that are willing to not live on the bridge is, um, Ailish, you've heard of this guy named Willy, um, uh, I forgot his name. Uh, the other Norn, um, does live on an island, uh, rocks nearby, but, uh, they also

[01:06:20] Speaker 55: Grimnar.

[01:06:21] Speaker 1: Grimnar. That's right. I gotta put the names up there so I can remember their names too.

[01:06:25] Speaker 53: (laughs)

[01:06:25] Speaker 1: I do most of them, but, uh, yeah.

[01:06:27] Speaker 51: Okay. All right. Well, if I don't find any evidence that there are other witches about, um, as it gets closer to sunset, maybe a few less people out, I'll put a few witch marks of my own out, uh, to indicate that there is one in the area. Others can seek me out if, since I wasn't able to find anyone else.

[01:06:48] Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

[01:06:49] Speaker 51: Uh-And then I'll check in with Nottvig, see how he's faring since up 'til this point he's been keep, trying to keep a low profile. Uh, because I don't want to advertise the fact that I'm a witch yet.

[01:07:03] Speaker 1: (laughs)

[01:07:04] Speaker 51: Um...

[01:07:05] Speaker 1: Oh yeah. Oh, you having him live outside of the, uh?

[01:07:07] Speaker 51: Uh, he's a trash griffin. I figure he's spending most of his time-

[01:07:12] Speaker 1: (laughs)

[01:07:12] Speaker 51: ... finding corners to hide in and then stealing food at night from the sh- from whatever trash he can get into.

[01:07:19] Speaker 1: Yeah. You can, um, do that. And if you wanna have him have a place to sleep, I mean, in here there's not much of a room in here. But there is kind of a top area up here that's a lookout area. It's also a lot of pigeons and other stuff.

[01:07:29] Speaker 51: I mean he can fly, so yeah, that would be-

[01:07:31] Speaker 56: Is that your familiar?

[01:07:32] Speaker 1: Yeah. You can stay close, but you stay up there if you want.

[01:07:36] Speaker 56: What's its name?

[01:07:36] Speaker 1: You're wanted him too. (laughs)

[01:07:38] Speaker 51: Okay. Uh, but yeah. That's- that's how Aranor's gonna spend his day.

[01:07:42] Speaker 1: Let's see. You guys had... looking over here at Gaz. Um, what wasn't grabbed? We've got the-

[01:07:52] Speaker 56: Is that an AI modified picture of you for your character?

[01:07:54] Speaker 51: Mm-mm.

[01:07:55] Speaker 56: Looks like it.

[01:07:56] Speaker 51: I mean, you're right.

[01:07:57] Speaker 56: (laughs)

[01:07:58] Speaker 51: But, uh, no. I didn't give it a picture of me to, to start with. (laughs)

[01:08:01] Speaker 56: (laughs) Looks a lot like you.

[01:08:04] Speaker 1: So you guys have one-

[01:08:04] Speaker 56: Like... (laughs)

[01:08:05] Speaker 1: ... got one downtime day outta the way. If you guys wanna do it again for another one, you're... Or whatever you guys wanna do for the next day.

[01:08:12] Speaker 56: Well, what do you guys wanna do?

[01:08:15] Speaker 57: I don't know anything.

[01:08:16] Speaker 43: Going to hire someone.

[01:08:16] Speaker 57: But did I hear you say-

[01:08:17] Speaker 43: To transfer my ring.

[01:08:18] Speaker 57: ... your familiar's name. His name is Nottvig.

[01:08:19] Speaker 1: Yeah, you can go. There is kind of some, a basic blacksmithy here.

[01:08:22] Speaker 57: Oh, I don't know them, so.

[01:08:23] Speaker 1: Um, if you talk to Gaz also.

[01:08:25] Speaker 57: That's cool, man.

[01:08:25] Speaker 1: He knows a guy. Um, and, and, uh, they can also do it for you. It might take them a day, but, uh... So there's a few if you wanna pay for someone to do it, that you could do that.

[01:08:36] Speaker 43: I will talk to both and find out that's there... is an advantage to one or the other.

[01:08:43] Speaker 1: Um, well one's gonna be a hob, so take that for what you may. The other one, um...

[01:08:51] Speaker 43: They have no problem with green creatures.

[01:08:53] Speaker 51: Yeah.

[01:08:53] Speaker 1: Um.

[01:08:54] Speaker 56: (laughs) Hope not.

[01:08:56] Speaker 1: In both cases, you think you could have it back by tomorrow if you head off right away?

[01:09:00] Speaker 57: Yeah. For all the goblins and hobgoblins-

[01:09:02] Speaker 56: All those-

[01:09:02] Speaker 57: ... green skinned heroes?

[01:09:03] Speaker 1: Um, for the most part. Um, goblins are... hobgoblins might be a slightly more of a green, green screen.

[01:09:09] Speaker 57: Okay.

[01:09:09] Speaker 51: All right. I'll do it.

[01:09:10] Speaker 1: Oh.

[01:09:11] Speaker 51: Probably the blacksmith.

[01:09:11] Speaker 1: And then you guys had, um... Which one?

[01:09:13] Speaker 43: The blacksmith.

[01:09:14] Speaker 1: Blacksmith.

[01:09:14] Speaker 43: Who's on the bridge. I don't want it to be sent off bridge.

[01:09:17] Speaker 1: (laughs) Oh yeah. The only... Who was the other one? It was uh... Armar was your uh, or um, Bra. Um...

[01:09:26] Speaker 56: What's this character's name again?

[01:09:27] Speaker 57: Is it Roldan?

[01:09:28] Speaker 1: Roldan. But the name is-

[01:09:29] Speaker 43: Bra.

[01:09:30] Speaker 1: His nickname is Bra.

[01:09:31] Speaker 43: He spells it as bra.

[01:09:32] Speaker 51: (laughs)

[01:09:32] Speaker 1: Um, I think he had the other runes, so it was Roldan.

[01:09:34] Speaker 57: Is the bridge itself a town?

[01:09:36] Speaker 1: It's as close as you're gonna get to one.

[01:09:38] Speaker 57: Okay.

[01:09:39] Speaker 1: And bear in mind, this is how we built it.

[01:09:40] Speaker 43: You're figuring out that there's basically a community li- lives on it.

[01:09:42] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[01:09:43] Speaker 57: Okay.

[01:09:43] Speaker 56: It's a small village.

[01:09:44] Speaker 43: It's very small.

[01:09:44] Speaker 57: Yeah.

[01:09:44] Speaker 43: On the bridge.

[01:09:45] Speaker 1: Mostly this is-

[01:09:46] Speaker 43: And I'm sure it is like four times bigger than it looks.

[01:09:49] Speaker 51: Okay.

[01:09:50] Speaker 43: Um, the m- the model is too small.

[01:09:51] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[01:09:52] Speaker 57: Well he said it's not to scale, so...

[01:09:53] Speaker 43: Relative to the size... Relative to the size of the minis, it's probably two-

[01:09:56] Speaker 51: Yeah.

[01:09:56] Speaker 43: ... two to four times bigger.

[01:09:57] Speaker 51: (laughs)

[01:09:57] Speaker 1: Yeah, I'd say it was.

[01:09:58] Speaker 43: He said twice as wide and twice as tall.

[01:09:59] Speaker 57: That's kinda what I thought, but it's just...

[01:10:02] Speaker 43: Yeah. Okay.

[01:10:03] Speaker 1: They'll be

[01:10:04] Speaker 58: They're good.

[01:10:04] Speaker 1: ... work for referencing stuff.

[01:10:05] Speaker 58: Uh, yeah, much larger.

[01:10:07] Speaker 43: It's big. It's a 5, 10 minute walk from end to end.

[01:10:10] Speaker 1: Yeah. I mean, I'd say it's... I'd say, yeah. It's kinda like the Imagine crossing the Missouri. But it's fine dwarven craftsmanship. You having a dwarf in your party, I mean, you think this is gonna be around for possibly hundreds of years unless something drastic happens.

[01:10:24] Speaker 57: That's hopefully-

[01:10:24] Speaker 43: Oh no, not something drastic.

[01:10:25] Speaker 1: This is... This and the road are built to last. I mean, they-

[01:10:29] Speaker 43: This, for the record-

[01:10:30] Speaker 1: ... this is Dwarven.

[01:10:31] Speaker 43: This model is a Chekhov's gun.

[01:10:34] Speaker 56: (laughs)

[01:10:35] Speaker 57: Is a what?

[01:10:36] Speaker 43: Chekhov's gun.

[01:10:37] Speaker 56: Yeah.

[01:10:38] Speaker 43: He was an ar- ar- author, I think, who said that if you... he was g- you know, he said, "If you are writing a story or making a TV show or something, and in the first scene you mention that there is a gun sitting on a table, by God, later in the plot, that gun better be important."

[01:10:54] Speaker 56: (laughs)

[01:10:54] Speaker 43: Because otherw- otherwise, why did you waste time mentioning it?"

[01:10:57] Speaker 57: Oh.

[01:10:57] Speaker 1: Oh wait, now I gotta put a world ending thing on the bridge now.

[01:11:00] Speaker 56: (laughs)

[01:11:01] Speaker 57: I see what you mean. Yep.

[01:11:02] Speaker 43: Solid. You made this.

[01:11:04] Speaker 1: Oh yeah. Well, it has to get used.

[01:11:05] Speaker 43: Not just because it's cool.

[01:11:06] Speaker 57: You went through all of the effort.

[01:11:08] Speaker 43: I mean, it is...

[01:11:09] Speaker 1: It may reappear a few times.

[01:11:10] Speaker 43: It is a centerpiece.

[01:11:12] Speaker 56: Yeah.

[01:11:12] Speaker 1: Um, well I think I even said it when we were... when I was building it, you guys saw me. You know, that I considered getting a centerpiece for the center point of this campaign.

[01:11:19] Speaker 43: Yeah.

[01:11:20] Speaker 1: Um, so yeah, you can do that. Um, the rest of you... and then what do you guys wanna do for the rest of the first day or second day? If you want to, I'm guessing you wanna get your thing installed before you go off on your adventure.

[01:11:30] Speaker 43: Yes. I would like to just... This time I will literally just relax.

[01:11:34] Speaker 1: Oh. If you wanna figure out however much that is.

[01:11:36] Speaker 43: Or use this.

[01:11:36] Speaker 1: Um, and then we can do the coinage.

[01:11:39] Speaker 43: We round up or down? We're rounding up or down? It's fractional gold.

[01:11:41] Speaker 1: Um, I'm typically just gonna say round down to be in your guy's favor.

[01:11:43] Speaker 43: Okay.

[01:11:44] Speaker 1: You guys are doing a 10% discount.

[01:11:45] Speaker 43: It's 10% of the cost, so you can have three.

[01:11:49] Speaker 56: Just take it. You can keep all that.

[01:11:49] Speaker 43: Oh, those are two's.

[01:11:50] Speaker 57: Yeah.

[01:11:50] Speaker 56: You could just take it also. Ring price.

[01:11:53] Speaker 43: We also want to see if anybody... Let's talk to what's her face. Who's the, uh, the one under the bridge?

[01:11:58] Speaker 57: That's a cold looking nerd woman.

[01:11:59] Speaker 56: Oh. My other one went under the bridge.

[01:12:01] Speaker 57: Secret.

[01:12:01] Speaker 56: I see.

[01:12:01] Speaker 43: So I need one back. Um, well I also want to... Well, I'm gonna mostly react, re- relax, but we will, uh... I will talk to, uh, she knows a guy. I don't remember their name.

[01:12:12] Speaker 57: I know a guy.

[01:12:13] Speaker 1: Gaz.

[01:12:14] Speaker 43: Gaz. Um, like the, the sergeant for bridge four, um, in Way of Kings. Um, Gaz, I will s- I will say, "We found this, we found this ring. We are wondering if it might be valuable. Do you think you could find us a buyer?" Unless you want to negotiate. Be... do, that's cheating.

[01:12:37] Speaker 56: No, that's the, uh, father and daughter duo?

[01:12:39] Speaker 1: Yeah. That's the head captain and, uh, his daughter. Um, he's Rolf and she's, um...

[01:12:47] Speaker 57: He's Rolf Laughter.

[01:12:48] Speaker 1: Captain Rolf.

[01:12:48] Speaker 57: Or, laughing.

[01:12:49] Speaker 56: (laughs)

[01:12:49] Speaker 1: Amelia.

[01:12:53] Speaker 59: Oh, there we go there.

[01:12:54] Speaker 60: Um-

[01:12:54] Speaker 1: We would like her to help us find somebody to buy this ring. Basically, we wanna sell the ring, but for role play reasons-

[01:13:01] Speaker 61: What kind of rating did you guys get?

[01:13:01] Speaker 1: ... we will see if we can find a good buyer for it.

[01:13:05] Speaker 61: What kind of rating did you get?

[01:13:05] Speaker 59: Um, can I read it?

[01:13:06] Speaker 1: Instead of just taking it to the general store.

[01:13:07] Speaker 59: It lets you read if you know the language.

[01:13:09] Speaker 1: Um, your, your basic things, um-

[01:13:11] Speaker 59: (laughs)

[01:13:11] Speaker 61: Okay.

[01:13:11] Speaker 1: ... because the Hobbs don't have a whole lot of money.

[01:13:12] Speaker 59: Because it's magic, it doesn't really mean much.

[01:13:14] Speaker 1: Um, well, your basic options are the... The general stores will take it at standard half price.

[01:13:20] Speaker 59: Yeah.

[01:13:20] Speaker 1: Um, you can try to haggle with some of the caravans when they're in town, and you might get a better percentage, maybe instead of half, you might get up to, um, you know, maybe two thirds, maybe three quarters on a real good...

[01:13:32] Speaker 62: What do you want, my friend? You want to wait and get for... Try to get a better price?

[01:13:35] Speaker 1: And the caravans-

[01:13:36] Speaker 59: Not in a rush.

[01:13:37] Speaker 62: Well, he said that, he said the caravan is coming in a few days.

[01:13:40] Speaker 59: Yeah, let's wait.

[01:13:41] Speaker 1: And most of the caravans is going to be for trying to exchange for another item. Um, now they have a decent chunk of items when they come through. But if you guys want something special ordered, um, talk to, um, uh, Captain Irka. Um, basically, what you do is you can put a down payment on it for about... Sometime around half, and then one of the next caravans that come through, you know, you pay the other half and they, they bring it in. Because if they're not... If it's a common item, generally, it's not too hard to find here, you get those pretty quick. But anything especially uncommon or rare, they have to, you have to requisition those.

[01:14:13] Speaker 59: Cold iron, uh, chunk would be handy.

[01:14:16] Speaker 1: You don't have to.

[01:14:18] Speaker 59: I don't know if that's something you'd have on hand.

[01:14:20] Speaker 1: Um, for something like that, um, you think Gaz and her crew might be able to find it.

[01:14:27] Speaker 59: Have to have a down payment on it.

[01:14:29] Speaker 1: But, um, even the, the wagon and, and the, the place here, they sell a lot of stuff like that, they probably have it. So, if you wanted to buy it from them, you could.

[01:14:36] Speaker 59: Nah, I gotta make the money. I, I don't have enough.

[01:14:39] Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

[01:14:39] Speaker 59: They got like two gold still. I don't have very much.

[01:14:42] Speaker 1: She said 10. We got paid. Oh, that was... You weren't part of the caravan. Yeah.

[01:14:46] Speaker 59: Nope.

[01:14:46] Speaker 1: I have 10.

[01:14:47] Speaker 61: Oh, we all got paid 10 gold?

[01:14:49] Speaker 1: Yeah, there you go. They, they, you, you didn't get the coins for session one.

[01:14:53] Speaker 59: Did you guys have that in your totals for the session one?

[01:14:56] Speaker 60: Uh, no.

[01:14:56] Speaker 59: I definitely do not have 10 gold.

[01:14:58] Speaker 1: Okay. Because they gave you 10.

[01:14:59] Speaker 60: We got paid in gold for guarding the caravan on the way here.

[01:15:02] Speaker 1: So, first of all, what's your grand total for gold, and then we'll add 10 on top.

[01:15:04] Speaker 61: I have 13 gold right, or silver and five copper right now.

[01:15:08] Speaker 1: With the 10 payment?

[01:15:11] Speaker 59: We'll, we'll just round up. Yeah.

[01:15:13] Speaker 61: Um...

[01:15:13] Speaker 1: So rounded, rounded gold.

[01:15:15] Speaker 61: Oh. 14.

[01:15:16] Speaker 1: 14?

[01:15:17] Speaker 61: Uh.

[01:15:17] Speaker 1: Is that with or without the 10 from being paid?

[01:15:20] Speaker 61: I don't remember adding that, so I'm gonna say without.

[01:15:23] Speaker 1: Did you not spend any money? You started the game with 15.

[01:15:27] Speaker 61: Uh, no, I did spend money. That was with the gift tag. Okay. So, 10, that should be... That's two, yep. 10's already... That's 14.

[01:15:37] Speaker 59: And how much do you have? All the rest should be watching you. If I'm remembering right, it's eight.

[01:15:41] Speaker 61: That would be cool.

[01:15:42] Speaker 1: And that would be... That would be including the 10?

[01:15:44] Speaker 60: Not including the 10.

[01:15:46] Speaker 1: If it included the 10, it would be more than 10.

[01:15:48] Speaker 60: We used to use a lot of like... Okay.

[01:15:53] Speaker 1: What are them square ones? Same thing. They were the different company cards or inventory and coins.

[01:15:56] Speaker 61: Are they five or 10?

[01:15:58] Speaker 1: Um, this is a five, but they come in all sizes. They get... They start small and they gradually get wider, until you're up to like a thousand.

[01:16:09] Speaker 61: Ugh, that's not what I wanted to do.

[01:16:14] Speaker 1: So, anything else you want to do real quick and then we'll talk to them? No. Uh, then I will be relaxing and playing the lute. I don't generally sing. People here have been having some requests for this. I, I am more of a instrumentalist. Although, perhaps at some point I will try.

[01:16:28] Speaker 60: Ardor sings.

[01:16:29] Speaker 1: Perhaps I will have the... I do not mind having, uh, a partner. But and perhaps someday, he will have the confidence to sing himself, but as a quiet, as a, as a soft-spoken person, he does not sing when he performs.

[01:16:44] Speaker 61: Yeah, I guess for many, because I surprised Duke said.

[01:16:44] Speaker 1: Anything you want to do for Duke's passing?

[01:16:46] Speaker 59: I would impart more knowledge on rosencrans. Teach him the ways of engineering and invention.

[01:16:57] Speaker 1: It's always fun to reinvent stuff. And again, for the first two times you'd spend a day with one of the Grasswurz side, I'm not going to have you do a skill. But after this, um, after that second day you spend with them, then you start... You pick a skill and if you succeed with that, he'll add something about him.

[01:17:08] Speaker 61: Are we paying-

[01:17:08] Speaker 1: But for the second day, um, you learn that he, um, uh, uh... If you become... If you increase your level to friend with him, um, he'll actually let you stay in the, uh, tower that he's in. Um, there's room in there. Uh, it's kind of crowded unfortunately. It's, um... Your gonna, might get your ankles bumped a lot and you might slip 'cause it's, uh... The stone they used wasn't the best stone because when it gets damp, it gets slippery. S- but beyond that, it's still a lot nicer and quieter than the, uh, hostas are. So, anyone who does get to level up has that option, he may want to let you stay with him.

[01:17:44] Speaker 59: That's fine. And it seems kind of mechanically annoying.

[01:17:47] Speaker 61: I would probably also like try to find like someone who is either part of an acting troupe or if that is a thing where like someone who likes to spar or somebody like that.

[01:18:03] Speaker 1: I mean, sparring, yes. Acting is... Some of the, um... Pretty much what there here is there's a few people. There's basically, at any time once the caravan goes out, there's basically about, um, one or two dozen guards, um, captain and his daughter over that. Then there's, um, a few people-

[01:18:22] Speaker 59: I don't think that's a good skill.

[01:18:24] Speaker 1: There's a few people who run the, uh, various, um... Maybe two or three people that run... You met the guy that runs the, uh, tavern.

[01:18:32] Speaker 61: Nice catch.

[01:18:32] Speaker 1: You met Gaz. And then there's like one or two other people that run those other, um... You know, a blacksmith who also runs his little thing there. Another person that kind of does that. Yeah, there's not a lot of other people that are here permanently. So, you wouldn't, um, like acting or anything like that. Some of the guards, you might, might have an interest in it. Um, sparring, yeah. The, the guards are, uh... They do sparring kind of all the time in training.It's pretty dangerous out here, so despite the fact these can be kind of mercenary louds at times, they also... They're more serious than the guys you saw in the caravan. And they'll actually-

[01:19:03] Speaker 63: Or I guess, yeah, or like fencing type of (00:03:00) sparring?

[01:19:07] Speaker 1: Yeah, you could find, I mean, the, the guards and whatnot would be willing to-

[01:19:11] Speaker 63: He has a rapier so...

[01:19:13] Speaker 1: And last but not least, your second day, number two.

[01:19:17] Speaker 51: Um, sort of similar to the first day, although this time I definitely wanna make an effort to meet Sigrid. Uh-

[01:19:24] Speaker 1: Oh, she'll greet you saying... Uh, she would recog- now, I mean, Norns stand out because you're much taller than the average human.

[01:19:30] Speaker 51: Yeah.

[01:19:30] Speaker 1: Um, she said, "Well, well met, kinsman."

[01:19:33] Speaker 51: "Well met. You go far from home, as I mine."

[01:19:38] Speaker 1: "Hi."

[01:19:39] Speaker 51: "What brings you here?"

[01:19:40] Speaker 1: "Uh, trade mostly. Um, my, uh, uncle is out here, um, in his own, uh, pigheaded foolishness, um, and my dad asked me to take care of him."

[01:19:53] Speaker 51: And we're speaking in Skald, right?

[01:19:56] Speaker 1: Uh, if you want to, yeah.

[01:19:57] Speaker 51: Yeah.

[01:19:57] Speaker 1: Most of the time, if you guys speak in a common language, um, you wanna speak in common-

[01:20:01] Speaker 51: I just wanted us to be speaking in our Norn language-

[01:20:04] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[01:20:04] Speaker 51: ... lest chance others know it as well.

[01:20:06] Speaker 1: "Yeah, have you met him yet?" Or, he doesn't speak Skald. "Have you met him yet? Um, my uncle, lives here in the area. If you haven't driven there, he's..." He points out over the, uh, uh, bridge. And again, you'd see the island. Right after that big island to the south of you, there's another little s- more of an outcropping of small, rocky... There's a little hut that's on there.

[01:20:30] Speaker 51: Had I met him?

[01:20:30] Speaker 1: No, you haven't yet. These guys did. He's that bottom one over there.

[01:20:33] Speaker 51: Yeah.

[01:20:34] Speaker 1: Um-

[01:20:34] Speaker 51: "I haven't had the opportunity yet. I will definitely reach out."

[01:20:38] Speaker 1: "Well, if you get a chance, um, you should head out there. Um, one of these days he might even have a task for you. He's been asking me to do something. Um, he has this foolish notion about raising bees, getting honey, and finding pelts and whatnot. Um, but if you ever chance to, go there and say hi. Um, that, uh... then, you know, I like to keep an eye on him. Uh, yeah, make sure he's staying safe."

[01:21:07] Speaker 51: (laughs).

[01:21:08] Speaker 1: Um, he basically, as, as you talk throughout the day, you learn that, um, he basically, um... For one reason or another, they kind of fled, um, Solstheim and came here. Um, he's kind of keeping... By, by basically isolating himself in a certain way, she hasn't... He's not being the most sociable with everyone else. Um, but she's been here. As the caravans come through, she works with kind of like one of the general stores and helps sell things and deal with the caravan. And then as he, um, he has bees, as he gets like honey and furs and other stuff like that, he's kind of a hunter, a beekeeper/guy, she takes it and sells it to the caravans for money and that's how the two survive.

[01:21:49] Speaker 51: Okay.

[01:21:49] Speaker 1: But she's usually here. Um, he's always on a rock somewhere or on land tending his bees.

[01:21:55] Speaker 51: "And did you have a fair at Lugnasa?"

[01:21:59] Speaker 1: What's that?

[01:22:00] Speaker 51: Uh, Lugnasa, it's a, a f- i- in Nordic culture, it's a fairly large festival that's held around, uh, August 1st. I'm assuming there would be something similar.

[01:22:14] Speaker 1: Oh, yeah. Um, she might say that that, you know, perhaps there'll be some, um... It's only really the two of them. Yeah, I think there's a few Norns here, but, um, they've never had enough people to celebrate it. But if you want to, um, she could probably convince her uncle to do something like that.

[01:22:28] Speaker 51: "Well, House of Bloats is a month away. Perhaps we can arrange a celebration for that."

[01:22:35] Speaker 1: "All right. It'd be nice to have a touch of home again, here in the wilderness."

[01:22:40] Speaker 51: "It's been far too long since I've gotten to be the conductor of a sider."

[01:22:51] Speaker 1: Um, yeah, if you're willing to host, she'd be more than willing to... And she's sure could get her uncle to join in or whatnot too. Yeah, if you want, in the future, just if you want to give me like a day or time so that I, I can put it on the calendar and-

[01:23:01] Speaker 51: So how-

[01:23:01] Speaker 1: You can just Discord it over to me too and I can try to get something lined up.

[01:23:06] Speaker 51: And let me check-

[01:23:06] Speaker 1: Or we can mark it on the calendar.

[01:23:08] Speaker 51: Let's see. House of Bloats, when is House of Bloats? Oh, there it is. Uh, House of Bloats is the 22nd of September typically, so we have quite a while before the next festival. (laughs)

[01:23:21] Speaker 1: Just checking. Yeah, I'll hunt that one out here, the 22nd. In this world it's known as Old Lughnass. That's also September, it's the 22nd.

[01:23:27] Speaker 51: Mm-hmm.

[01:23:29] Speaker 64: I didn't know... I guess I forgot you were really big into Norse stuff.

[01:23:34] Speaker 1: Norse stuff is a lot of fun. Yeah, it helps breathe a lot of life into the character too. But, yeah. So you guys basically spend the rest of the day... Um, you can chitchat, you get to, you know, be around town, see people and whatnot. Um, night comes again.

[01:23:48] Speaker 65: Can I, can I interrupt?

[01:23:49] Speaker 1: Oh, yep.

[01:23:50] Speaker 65: Can you remind us who the Dramatis Personae are? Like, literally there's Lynn, there's-

[01:23:55] Speaker 1: Silvia.

[01:23:55] Speaker 65: ... Sylvia is one, right?

[01:23:56] Speaker 1: Yep. Silvia, top left. She is here, um, uh... As a matter for dueling, um, Silvia, um, if you have a chance to meet her, um, she is, um, a duelist. Um, she is of a noble family. When you have a chance to meet her, you learn her last name is Mournhold, uh, which doesn't really mean much to you guys, but to you it does. You would know Mournhold, in the time and era that you're from, is a fairly famous military family. Kind of like we say like a Wellington in Britain, you know, is famous. Um, they'd be kind of... They're fairly well known.

[01:24:29] Speaker 51: Which is she?

[01:24:30] Speaker 1: She's the top-

[01:24:31] Speaker 65: Top left?

[01:24:31] Speaker 1: Uh, yeah. The one with white hair and the white up-

[01:24:34] Speaker 64: Top left.

[01:24:35] Speaker 1: ... white shirt on in the background.

[01:24:36] Speaker 65: Silvia, Lynn, who's the third one?

[01:24:38] Speaker 1: The third one, that's Irka. You got to talk to him.

[01:24:41] Speaker 65: Okay. Irka is a Dramatis Personae?

[01:24:43] Speaker 66: Yep.

[01:24:43] Speaker 65: Yep.

[01:24:45] Speaker 1: You guys can also spend time with him. He has his own sets of rules, rules what not. Then, um, Aelysh is the top, uh...

[01:24:51] Speaker 65: Aelysh is?

[01:24:51] Speaker 66: How do you spell? Oh.

[01:24:53] Speaker 1: A-E-L-Y-S-H.

[01:24:54] Speaker 65: Got it. It was right. Brilliant. And then last one.

[01:24:58] Speaker 51: There's two more.

[01:25:00] Speaker 1: Um...

[01:25:00] Speaker 51: Grimnir?

[01:25:01] Speaker 67: Well, no. He's, uh, he... I just put his photo there.

[01:25:03] Speaker 68: Oh, okay.

[01:25:04] Speaker 67: He's not in. Um, and then, um-

[01:25:08] Speaker 43: Rosencrantz.

[01:25:08] Speaker 68: No, Rosencrantz is not out there yet.

[01:25:10] Speaker 67: Um-

[01:25:11] Speaker 69: But then we also have the -

[01:25:12] Speaker 67: No, the, the, the norn you guys met last week.

[01:25:14] Speaker 70: Do you have a picture of Rosencrantz?

[01:25:17] Speaker 69: You want... Sure. Which one of those is gonna be the question?

[01:25:18] Speaker 67: Yeah.

[01:25:19] Speaker 70: Uh-

[01:25:19] Speaker 67: One of those two. I haven't quite decided.

[01:25:21] Speaker 69: And you got the, the goblin?

[01:25:22] Speaker 70: Oh, right. Okay. Yep.

[01:25:23] Speaker 69: The goblin?

[01:25:23] Speaker 43: No, waitressing.

[01:25:23] Speaker 68: I'm doing them one at a time.

[01:25:24] Speaker 69: Those two.

[01:25:25] Speaker 68: I don't wanna miss anybody. Who's that?

[01:25:26] Speaker 67: Um, what was his name again? Um-

[01:25:28] Speaker 69: Just a minute. I can look that up.

[01:25:30] Speaker 43: Just, what was th- his nature?

[01:25:35] Speaker 67: He is a hunter.

[01:25:38] Speaker 69: A dwarf?

[01:25:39] Speaker 67: Grimnar.

[01:25:40] Speaker 43: Grimnar?

[01:25:41] Speaker 67: Yeah.

[01:25:41] Speaker 43: How do you spell that? There are many-

[01:25:42] Speaker 67: G-R-I-M-N-A-R.

[01:25:44] Speaker 43: N-A-R. Brilliant. I just wanna capture them since they're important.

[01:25:52] Speaker 69: (laughs) And then you got the, uh, gnome waitress?

[01:25:56] Speaker 43: Gaz.

[01:25:56] Speaker 69: Cafe owner.

[01:25:58] Speaker 43: Spelled?

[01:25:58] Speaker 67: G-A-Z.

[01:26:04] Speaker 70: Okay.

[01:26:05] Speaker 68: She's a brother.

[01:26:06] Speaker 43: And she's a major, not a minor.

[01:26:08] Speaker 67: She's a major, yep.

[01:26:10] Speaker 69: Nvidia.

[01:26:11] Speaker 68: Oh, there's that one.

[01:26:12] Speaker 67: So Nvidia's not a-

[01:26:13] Speaker 43: That's what I thought.

[01:26:13] Speaker 69: Not a major one, but-

[01:26:15] Speaker 67: So basically there's two more that have been added there tonight. That's Gaz and Rosencrant.

[01:26:19] Speaker 43: Okay. How is Rosencrant spelled? R-O-S... R-R-O-S-E-N-C-R-A-N-

[01:26:26] Speaker 67: T-E, I believe.

[01:26:27] Speaker 43: T-E? That's not a... It's gotta have a S sound in it.

[01:26:30] Speaker 68: Is it with a TZ?

[01:26:30] Speaker 43: Rosencrant?

[01:26:30] Speaker 67: I don't know if that the way it-

[01:26:32] Speaker 43: Like-

[01:26:32] Speaker 67: Yeah.

[01:26:32] Speaker 43: ... is it spelled the way Shakespeare spells it?

[01:26:34] Speaker 67: It's spelled the way Shakespeare spells it.

[01:26:36] Speaker 43: Yes. It's a TZ, because it was a character from-

[01:26:40] Speaker 67: Yeah.

[01:26:40] Speaker 43: ... a previous campaign. I don't wanna change the spelling.

[01:26:42] Speaker 67: Well, I don't... I still like to call... I never read... That's not where I got the name from, but I always called him Rosencrant and I don't know... I never think I had an official way of spelling it. I probably spelled differently.

[01:26:51] Speaker 43: I just want to get the names in there and then the AI will flesh them out after the session is over.

[01:26:58] Speaker 68: Oh, can you insert their pictures in there?

[01:27:00] Speaker 43: No. The AI can't put in the pictures.

[01:27:03] Speaker 67: Um, some of you guys, um, if you have anything else, you can rest up for the night.

[01:27:06] Speaker 43: Oh, we could actually. Maybe that's a new trick. May- (laughs) my next weekend experiment will be to have it read the pictures in order to get a physical description of them.

[01:27:15] Speaker 68: Well, you know, it just seemed like it would be... For something like this, it seems like, you know, if you have a picture that you can actually use to put into there that it would pull from.

[01:27:24] Speaker 70: It's great. But it's also kind of, like, crazy and a little scary to see the fact that AI can now do all this.

[01:27:32] Speaker 43: Welcome to 2025.

[01:27:33] Speaker 68: Just getting worse.

[01:27:34] Speaker 70: I know, I know.

[01:27:34] Speaker 43: (laughs) It's not getting worse. It's getting better.

[01:27:37] Speaker 68: Uh, cooler but-

[01:27:38] Speaker 43: It's getting better where it is. Yeah.

[01:27:40] Speaker 68: Yeah.

[01:27:41] Speaker 43: We're not up to the point where hell is gonna kill us.

[01:27:43] Speaker 68: Well, by, by definition, my opinion matters more than everyone else's. (laughs)

[01:27:47] Speaker 43: Whatever. (laughs)

[01:27:48] Speaker 69: (laughs)

[01:27:48] Speaker 67: It's true for you too.

[01:27:49] Speaker 68: Your opinion matters to you more than everybody else's.

[01:27:52] Speaker 69: Well, that's why mine's more important so...

[01:27:54] Speaker 70: Yeah. And yeah-

[01:27:55] Speaker 69: I mean, it's, it's cool, but-

[01:27:57] Speaker 70: I don't have that-

[01:27:58] Speaker 69: There's, there's pros and cons to it, I think.

[01:28:00] Speaker 70: I don't have to have much interaction with AI, I guess.

[01:28:03] Speaker 43: You will.

[01:28:04] Speaker 69: Yeah. Everybody will.

[01:28:05] Speaker 43: This is like, uh-

[01:28:06] Speaker 70: I know.

[01:28:07] Speaker 43: This is like 1993, 1994, the beginning of the internet. This is like dial-up AOL.

[01:28:15] Speaker 69: Yeah.

[01:28:15] Speaker 70: Yeah.

[01:28:15] Speaker 69: (laughs) AOL sucks. (laughs)

[01:28:17] Speaker 43: Like, seven years from now, the world is gonna be a very different place because of this.

[01:28:21] Speaker 70: Yeah.

[01:28:22] Speaker 43: Just like se- you know, by the year 2000, the, like... Everything was different.

[01:28:27] Speaker 70: Mm-hmm.

[01:28:28] Speaker 68: I remember getting my first dial-up.

[01:28:30] Speaker 43: Yeah.

[01:28:30] Speaker 68: (laughs) It sucked. (laughs) I mean, relatively speaking.

[01:28:35] Speaker 70: I, I will say, getting all the memory-

[01:28:35] Speaker 68: Because, you know, you're like-

[01:28:36] Speaker 70: ... all the storage because this thing is way before my time.

[01:28:36] Speaker 68: ... you dial up and someone would call you and you'd get knocked off. Yeah. (laughs)

[01:28:41] Speaker 43: I eventually talked my... When I was a senior in high school, I talked my parents into a second phone line.

[01:28:46] Speaker 68: Yeah.

[01:28:47] Speaker 43: So that I could have... Be dialed into something, into a BBS, um.

[01:28:53] Speaker 68: (laughs)

[01:28:55] Speaker 43: And if my sister picked up the phone upstairs, it didn't disconnect anything.

[01:28:58] Speaker 68: Yeah.

[01:29:00] Speaker 43: Because I didn't have anybody to talk to, but my sister was a teenage girl and she was on the phone all the time.

[01:29:05] Speaker 68: Yeah.

[01:29:05] Speaker 70: (coughs)

[01:29:05] Speaker 43: It was the... It was the late '80s. There was nothing else to do but talk to your friends on the telephone.

[01:29:11] Speaker 68: Man, (laughs) with the stupid... We still had... We had several different phones in my family and like, one of them was still like the rotary, because my dad built a bookshelf that he didn't think about.

[01:29:22] Speaker 43: By the time I was a senior, we had the cliché, uh, what was it? AT&T or Panasonic cordless phone that everybody had.

[01:29:29] Speaker 68: Yep.

[01:29:29] Speaker 43: But before that, we had, like, the one phone in the living room with the 30-foot long coiled cable so that you could drag it into your room and close the door.

[01:29:37] Speaker 68: (laughs) Yeah. See, my dad, he didn't think about it, but he built a bookshelf and the, uh, phone, the ca- the cable was coming out from behind the bookshelf. And for some reason, this phone, it wasn't like, you know, how you have that little clip on the back?

[01:29:50] Speaker 43: Yeah.

[01:29:51] Speaker 68: The wire was like, straight into the phone. So you like, could not detach it. (laughs) So when they sold the house, I don't know, like five years ago, that same stupid rotary phone was still there because (laughs) nobody had just bothered.

[01:30:02] Speaker 70: My parents-

[01:30:02] Speaker 68: But that rotary phone sucked. I hate to say that.

[01:30:03] Speaker 70: My parents' house still has a landline that they use.

[01:30:07] Speaker 68: Yeah. My parents have a landline too, but not a rotary, but-

[01:30:12] Speaker 43: Well, he's 84 years old. He's allowed to have a landline if he wants one.

[01:30:14] Speaker 68: Yeah.

[01:30:15] Speaker 70: My parents' house was built in the '50s, so-

[01:30:17] Speaker 69: Who moves when you're 84? Nobody's gonna care anymore.

[01:30:19] Speaker 43: Do what you want.

[01:30:20] Speaker 69: Yeah.

[01:30:21] Speaker 43: He's supposed to be dead by now.

[01:30:23] Speaker 68: Well-

[01:30:24] Speaker 43: Every year that he's still alive is a bonus year and he can live it however the fuck he wants.

[01:30:29] Speaker 68: Yeah. Sure, why not?

[01:30:31] Speaker 67: So you guys rest up for the night. You're able to get you, uh, uh, run- or your weapon back.

[01:30:36] Speaker 43: He was a, like, chain smoker for 40 years.

[01:30:38] Speaker 68: (laughs) Yeah.

[01:30:38] Speaker 43: And he has no health problems. Like, he just-

[01:30:41] Speaker 70: You know... Ow. Ha, ow.

[01:30:44] Speaker 67: It's amazing how some of the old guys, they smoke and they drink and-

[01:30:47] Speaker 43: He should be dead from lung cancer.

[01:30:49] Speaker 68: Yeah. If you want to, I can collect your papers there and we can act on it.

[01:30:50] Speaker 69: My grandpa smoked like a chimney. He smoked a pipe all the time. And he didn't die until he was like 90, almost 94.

[01:30:58] Speaker 70: No, I didn't realize his birth. Oh. That's cool.

[01:30:59] Speaker 43: Well, I always wanted to cover it up so it would make a little more sense.

[01:31:02] Speaker 68: (laughs)

[01:31:03] Speaker 70: I didn't realize his birthday.

[01:31:05] Speaker 71: Are we putting these coins in the bags?

[01:31:07] Speaker 1: Yep.

[01:31:08] Speaker 72: Yep, that's... We're gonna keep 'em and we're gonna-

[01:31:09] Speaker 73: That is your coin purse.

[01:31:10] Speaker 1: So, it's basically what you have, uh, um... We're gonna look at those more than we're gonna look at, with, our, uh... The thing says. So, if you have to go in there, go in-

[01:31:18] Speaker 73: I'm not keeping track. I didn't beer a lot, do you care?

[01:31:20] Speaker 1: Yeah. No, I don't care.

[01:31:21] Speaker 72: Oh.

[01:31:21] Speaker 1: I only, only gonna use the coins. They're cool enough and it kinda sets it up.

[01:31:26] Speaker 71: Then I am keeping track, but also using-

[01:31:28] Speaker 1: Oh, yeah. Overnight too, you would've used up one of the, uh, blood tokens.

[01:31:32] Speaker 71: Okay. Oh, well, I won't have any way to keep track.

[01:31:34] Speaker 1: Oh, if you wanna just... Yeah, just hand them in to me. I'll keep 'em in the thing here. If you wanna... Oh. Because your character would've used it.

[01:31:41] Speaker 73: Give her a, give her a-

[01:31:41] Speaker 71: Oh.

[01:31:41] Speaker 73: ... blood token.

[01:31:42] Speaker 1: (laughs) So, basically just every night and every morning. But there will be opportunities-

[01:31:48] Speaker 71: I'm playing your favorite class again.

[01:31:51] Speaker 1: That's fine. (laughs)

[01:31:52] Speaker 72: At night you can go hunt rats for your-

[01:31:54] Speaker 1: So, you guys will-

[01:31:55] Speaker 72: (laughs)

[01:31:55] Speaker 1: ... need to move the stuff over here. It's gonna be-

[01:31:57] Speaker 72: Ah.

[01:31:57] Speaker 1: ... almost this entire thing. So, you get in the next morning, um, Ailish comes to meet you in the morning, assuming that you're-

[01:32:05] Speaker 73: Yes. We're gonna go and-

[01:32:06] Speaker 1: ... ready to go.

[01:32:07] Speaker 73: ... investigate this ma- museum. Not museum, uh, mansion.

[01:32:10] Speaker 1: Um-

[01:32:11] Speaker 71: You're using the whole...

[01:32:13] Speaker 1: Yep, I'm using pretty much all of it.

[01:32:15] Speaker 10: Gonna slide you guys back over here.

[01:32:17] Speaker 73: Oh, yeah. Okay.

[01:32:18] Speaker 10: Make sure we have space-

[01:32:18] Speaker 1: So, but there are some-

[01:32:18] Speaker 10: ... it sounds like.

[01:32:19] Speaker 1: You're able to take, uh, some boats if you want to. Um...

[01:32:25] Speaker 10: Maybe I should get one of those.

[01:32:25] Speaker 1: You guys can decide who wants to be on which boats.

[01:32:27] Speaker 71: This isn't gonna work when Michael's here because there'll be three people on this side. It's just like, well I'm gonna-

[01:32:32] Speaker 1: Well, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna build, um... I didn't... As you guys weren't here and so-

[01:32:35] Speaker 71: But I can also try a tablet like you said 'cause then I'll end up-

[01:32:37] Speaker 1: Well, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna build something over on the location. It's gonna be about this wide and it's gonna clip to the end of the table. And what's gonna have a little stand built into it for your, for, um, tablets. So, it'll be kinda-

[01:32:50] Speaker 10: Like what?

[01:32:50] Speaker 1: ... pointing up at you. Yeah, a lip built in right there. Then there'll be a cup holder and there'll be a little place where you can put dice there if you want to. So, that way that will sit right in front of you, and then, um...

[01:33:00] Speaker 71: What about trays for like, food?

[01:33:02] Speaker 1: Well, that you're probably gonna... That's where you'll probably have to grab one of the other trays, those little folding trays. And you can just put that off to the corner for now.

[01:33:08] Speaker 10: The TV trays?

[01:33:09] Speaker 1: TV out, yeah.

[01:33:09] Speaker 71: Yeah, yeah.

[01:33:10] Speaker 1: And then when you're done with them, just fold them back up. Um, but yeah, there will be a cup holder for the, for your drinks and then it's... For your dice. You guys can put stuff on the table. It's just to try to reduce as much being on the table as possible because as you're gonna see this gets-

[01:33:22] Speaker 71: Yeah, far cry from you being DM Kent.

[01:33:25] Speaker 1: (laughs)

[01:33:25] Speaker 10: Well-

[01:33:26] Speaker 1: So-

[01:33:26] Speaker 71: Just-

[01:33:27] Speaker 73: Oh.

[01:33:28] Speaker 71: Not that I'm complaining, but-

[01:33:29] Speaker 1: If you guys wanna decide who's on which boats, I printed off one specifically wide enough that-

[01:33:34] Speaker 10: Too much work to do it for every dungeon level.

[01:33:36] Speaker 1: One person's gonna be by themselves.

[01:33:38] Speaker 71: Yeah. I mean, the hand drawing worked too, so.

[01:33:44] Speaker 1: Mm-hmm. Yeah. That's... I mean, this is also partially a hobby for me.

[01:33:47] Speaker 10: Where do you wanna be?

[01:33:48] Speaker 1: Which is important because I-

[01:33:49] Speaker 10: Ah, I dunno. Put me in a, in a boat.

[01:33:50] Speaker 73: By yourself or with me?

[01:33:53] Speaker 10: No, sure. I'll go with you.

[01:33:54] Speaker 73: Oh, are you?

[01:33:55] Speaker 1: Yep, for now.

[01:33:57] Speaker 73: Or do you wanna be...

[01:33:58] Speaker 10: Sure.

[01:33:59] Speaker 71: I'll be in a boat with, uh...

[01:34:01] Speaker 1: Arnaur.

[01:34:04] Speaker 71: Arnaur, that's your name.

[01:34:05] Speaker 10: Wait, that's three people in a boat?

[01:34:07] Speaker 1: Who said... No.

[01:34:07] Speaker 73: Those ones will fit.

[01:34:08] Speaker 1: Oh, yeah. I think the, the... Ones will fit two, well three, and then one fits two. I do, I did print out some canoes that fit one.

[01:34:16] Speaker 71: She won't fit in the remaining boat.

[01:34:18] Speaker 1: Just as best you can. Hers... I think she's on a wider base 'cause she doesn't stand-

[01:34:22] Speaker 73: She's laying down in her boat by herself.

[01:34:24] Speaker 10: She needs the extra weight to, uh, hold her, kind of, so-

[01:34:26] Speaker 1: Yeah, I really like that miniature but the, uh, the thing kinda...

[01:34:32] Speaker 71: I feel like we're on a golf cart. (laughs)

[01:34:33] Speaker 1: She's actually even, the base is actually, it's actually a folding little base that she's on.

[01:34:37] Speaker 71: (laughs) It's kinda, kinda what it feels like.

[01:34:41] Speaker 1: Okay. I gotta get this set up here.

[01:34:43] Speaker 71: That's cool 'cause you, 'cause you both... (dramatic music)

[01:34:51] Speaker 10: That's a nice thing when you, uh, you know, having it in your house too. You can stash all this stuff-

[01:34:57] Speaker 71: Have all... Yeah.

[01:34:58] Speaker 10: ... or all this stuff are out too. It's really nice.

[01:34:58] Speaker 71: Yeah. Have all those props at your place, yeah.

[01:35:01] Speaker 1: Mm-hmm. (dramatic music)

[01:35:03] Speaker 71: Wow.

[01:35:04] Speaker 73: Oh.

[01:35:04] Speaker 10: Oh, that's the new house. I haven't seen that one. Oh wait, I haven't seen that one. Have I?

[01:35:08] Speaker 1: Uh-

[01:35:08] Speaker 72: Yeah, I've seen it.

[01:35:09] Speaker 1: I did a while back but I don't think I... I've got this one hidden because I didn't know how it was gonna-

[01:35:12] Speaker 71: I don't think you had it painted. (laughs)

[01:35:14] Speaker 10: Wait, no, that's a different house. Yeah.

[01:35:15] Speaker 1: I complained about this one. I know they did that for sure. You'll see why here in a little bit. (dramatic music)

[01:35:24] Speaker 71: Uh, yeah. Right.

[01:35:26] Speaker 10: I did warn them that there's a bunch of scorch marks on this house, it burns. (dramatic music)

[01:35:33] Speaker 1: Okay, now I don't know where they went. (dramatic music)

[01:35:45] Speaker 71: Wow. This is...

[01:35:50] Speaker 1: I gotta get my flock techniques down a little bit better. I ran out of the scenery cement that I usually use so this is actually not done very well.

[01:35:56] Speaker 71: What kind of technique?

[01:35:57] Speaker 1: Um, the... This is with the flock, that's that stuff on there and I ran out of the scenic cement so I just had to kinda improvise. And I didn't really-

[01:36:04] Speaker 71: Where do you buy all your stuff from?

[01:36:06] Speaker 1: I just go to any... They're like hobby shops. You go to like, um...

[01:36:09] Speaker 10: Noel Le Games has got the stuff or-

[01:36:11] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[01:36:11] Speaker 71: Yeah, Noble Kn-

[01:36:12] Speaker 10: Noble Knights.

[01:36:12] Speaker 71: Nobel Knights I know has.

[01:36:14] Speaker 1: Mm-hmm. Probably like any... Especially, um, railroading, uh, model railroad places.

[01:36:19] Speaker 71: Oh, yeah. That makes... Yeah.

[01:36:21] Speaker 10: That old war game store on, uh, what was it? Podana?

[01:36:26] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[01:36:26] Speaker 10: He's got all that, all this kind of stuff like this.

[01:36:29] Speaker 71: Not Pegasus?

[01:36:30] Speaker 10: No, th- their's was like... Pegasus is more like role playing. There used to be a war game like... So, like, old war game with like-

[01:36:38] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[01:36:38] Speaker 10: Like-

[01:36:38] Speaker 1: They were really into-

[01:36:39] Speaker 71: Oh.

[01:36:40] Speaker 10: Colonial, like Napoleonic war stuff and...

[01:36:43] Speaker 71: I see.

[01:36:45] Speaker 10: Like, really old war gaming.

[01:36:47] Speaker 71: Mm-hmm.

[01:36:51] Speaker 1: With the two tall ones. Do the...

[01:36:54] Speaker 10: I think that place has been closed awhile now.

[01:36:57] Speaker 1: I can't remember if they moved or if they sold it or whatnot, I can't remember.

[01:36:59] Speaker 71: I was gonna say, did COVID kill them or is just like before COVID?

[01:37:03] Speaker 10: I don't even know. I didn't exactly go there very often.

[01:37:09] Speaker 74: I never had any reason to go there. Most of my brother being been there once or twice. I don't remember what it was for. Oh, minis. They sold minis. So they go buy their own. Buy minis there once in a long time. Well, I had a place I put all these things, now I'm trying to remember where I put all these things. Well, doesn't really matter.

[01:37:40] Speaker 75: Place 'em randomly.

[01:37:42] Speaker 74: Yeah. Corners of the house maybe. Yeah, we'll put one there.

[01:37:51] Speaker 75: One by the iz- the gazebo?

[01:37:54] Speaker 74: Hmm, I think I had...

[01:37:58] Speaker 76: Sugar hay?

[01:37:59] Speaker 77: Hm?

[01:38:00] Speaker 75: Yeah, pretty much. (laughs)

[01:38:01] Speaker 74: That was going over there. So you guys are in your boats, you're making your way up.

[01:38:05] Speaker 75: I like that tree. That tree is beautiful.

[01:38:07] Speaker 78: Before we start, could I bother you for a glass of ice water?

[01:38:10] Speaker 76: Uh, yeah.

[01:38:11] Speaker 77: Same.

[01:38:12] Speaker 76: Two?

[01:38:12] Speaker 78: Yeah, I've almost finished mine.

[01:38:15] Speaker 75: Can I get like a half a glass of not ice water?

[01:38:18] Speaker 74: Oh, yeah. Give me a sec here, I'll...

[01:38:21] Speaker 79: I can give you a hand since this looks like there's-

[01:38:22] Speaker 74: Oh yeah, I might... (laughs) I actually, I got a little water thing I'm gonna bring down here eventually.

[01:38:28] Speaker 75: Oh, that would be great.

[01:38:29] Speaker 74: That'll be easy just do that. Oh yeah, come get me a few.

[01:38:32] Speaker 79: Three enough or being needed more?

[01:38:33] Speaker 74: Well, for the three of you and then... I think, yeah, three should be fine.

[01:38:36] Speaker 79: Okay. Thanks.

[01:38:38] Speaker 75: That big tree reminds me of (laughs) a bigger version of one of the trees that, um, big muscles would summon.

[01:38:47] Speaker 76: How's the emma?

[01:38:48] Speaker 78: (instrumental music plays) Did you do anything over the hot air?

[01:38:51] Speaker 77: Made AI to process audio.

[01:38:52] Speaker 78: Oh.

[01:38:52] Speaker 79: I thought it was going into something. ... Yeah, I did that too.

[01:38:55] Speaker 74: (footsteps thudding) Here you go.

[01:38:57] Speaker 78: Thank you.

[01:38:58] Speaker 74: Oh, he must have gone-

[01:38:58] Speaker 79: Yep.

[01:38:58] Speaker 74: ... to the bathroom.

[01:39:01] Speaker 78: Mm-hmm.

[01:40:35] Speaker 75: Just gotta not knock it over-

[01:40:38] Speaker 79: Yeah.

[01:40:38] Speaker 75: ... with my knee. That would not be good.

[01:40:41] Speaker 79: Nope. Well, at least it's not on the table.

[01:40:46] Speaker 75: True. That would be really bad too.

[01:40:49] Speaker 79: Nope.

[01:40:52] Speaker 75: Did you do anything for the holiday, Kent? Or Craig?

[01:40:57] Speaker 79: Which one? For, uh, Memorial Day?

[01:40:59] Speaker 75: Yeah, over the weekend.

[01:41:01] Speaker 79: Uh, I did get together with family.

[01:41:07] Speaker 77: One time.

[01:41:08] Speaker 79: Mm-hmm.

[01:41:09] Speaker 77: I was camping all weekend.

[01:41:11] Speaker 79: Oh, yeah? Where was that?

[01:41:12] Speaker 77: With my aunt has a cabin up by Minocqua.

[01:41:15] Speaker 79: Mm.

[01:41:15] Speaker 77: She invited my parents, my family up there.

[01:41:18] Speaker 79: Nice.

[01:41:19] Speaker 77: So.

[01:41:22] Speaker 74: Okay.

[01:41:24] Speaker 77: Went canoeing, went on a pontoon ride.

[01:41:26] Speaker 79: Did it rain on you?

[01:41:29] Speaker 77: Friday, it did, but the, all the forecasts we looked at, it wasn't, didn't say rain, so n- none of us brought rain jackets.

[01:41:36] Speaker 79: (laughs)

[01:41:37] Speaker 77: But it wasn't as bad as it could have been.

[01:41:41] Speaker 79: Mm.

[01:41:43] Speaker 77: The cooler weather helped keep the bugs down, so that was nice.

[01:41:46] Speaker 79: Yeah. That's one thing that...

[01:41:49] Speaker 77: My parents brought, we brought-

[01:41:50] Speaker 79: It hasn't been really hot yet this year.

[01:41:54] Speaker 77: Good. We brought our dogs and we found o- one tick on one of them, but other than that, didn't find any ticks, so-

[01:42:04] Speaker 79: Really?

[01:42:04] Speaker 77: Yeah. So that's good.

[01:42:05] Speaker 76: (humming)

[01:42:06] Speaker 79: That's what I hate about camp.

[01:42:09] Speaker 75: Yeah.

[01:42:09] Speaker 77: Mm-hmm.

[01:42:11] Speaker 75: But s- it was a nice escape from the life of concrete jungle.

[01:42:17] Speaker 79: Yeah.

[01:42:18] Speaker 75: So.

[01:42:18] Speaker 79: The older I get, the more I miss the country, to be honest.

[01:42:21] Speaker 76: No.

[01:42:21] Speaker 75: Uh-huh.

[01:42:23] Speaker 79: I mean, because I grew up in the country and...

[01:42:25] Speaker 75: Is that a tape, a tape measure?

[01:42:26] Speaker 74: Yep. 'Cause unfortunately with this, I didn't put a grid on the map.

[01:42:30] Speaker 79: I mean, maybe not as, like-

[01:42:31] Speaker 74: So-

[01:42:31] Speaker 79: ... a country that Craig wears, like-

[01:42:32] Speaker 75: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[01:42:32] Speaker 79: ... the mountains, but-

[01:42:33] Speaker 76: We'll figure it out.

[01:42:34] Speaker 74: So basically, our tape measures... um, so for this we'll be measuring, um, but it's really easy because one-

[01:42:40] Speaker 76: One-

[01:42:40] Speaker 74: ... inch equals five feet.

[01:42:41] Speaker 76: ... inch is, uh, five feet? Yeah.

[01:42:42] Speaker 74: So it's pretty easy by way of that. Um, just remember, you move from the same point on the miniature to the same point. So it's basically if you go six inches, you go from the center to the center or the front to the front. You don't go, you know-

[01:42:54] Speaker 77: You mean like the war-

[01:42:55] Speaker 74: Six-

[01:42:55] Speaker 77: ... the war gaming ones-

[01:42:56] Speaker 74: Yeah, war-

[01:42:57] Speaker 77: ... with the thinner tape measure.

[01:42:58] Speaker 74: I... Yeah, I do have one of these.

[01:42:59] Speaker 77: Oh, you have one of those? Yeah.

[01:43:00] Speaker 74: I have, um, those other crafting kinds. They're really small, but I can't find 'em, so... And Walmart was out of them, so I didn't buy any more. See, I have to do-

[01:43:09] Speaker 79: And the same thing goes for your spells. You'll just have to-

[01:43:12] Speaker 75: What count?

[01:43:14] Speaker 45: I thought that was... they were zombies, but they looked like goblins.

[01:43:17] Speaker 1: Oh. Um, you know what?

[01:43:18] Speaker 45: Maybe on-dead goblins.

[01:43:19] Speaker 1: I don't, I don't quite know what they are yet.

[01:43:20] Speaker 45: Yeah. We'll find out. (laughs)

[01:43:22] Speaker 1: Oh, and, uh, let's see.

[01:43:25] Speaker 80: My character's cool.

[01:43:26] Speaker 1: Kat, would you volunteer to, uh, run the, uh, spare characters? And you can come down here.

[01:43:31] Speaker 45: Oh, sure.

[01:43:31] Speaker 80: Um, suppose I could maybe do this.

[01:43:34] Speaker 1: Here we go. So Ailish is joining, you can play her.

[01:43:36] Speaker 45: I can...

[01:43:37] Speaker 1: They're not based off of a cl- well, they're based off of a class as far as their stats, but they're not. They're kinda like a nerfed version of a class where there's something that's-

[01:43:44] Speaker 80: But they're not only-

[01:43:44] Speaker 1: ... really easy to play. That they're not... You don't have to sit there and spend a whole lot of time-

[01:43:49] Speaker 45: Okay.

[01:43:49] Speaker 1: ... uh, you know, figuring out how to actually run them.

[01:43:56] Speaker 81: What time of day would it be they were approaching?

[01:43:58] Speaker 1: Um, whatever time you guys want.

[01:44:01] Speaker 45: I'd say probably morning.

[01:44:02] Speaker 81: Yeah.

[01:44:03] Speaker 45: I mean, it's only like a quarter to half a mile, so I'd say probably leave after breakfast.

[01:44:08] Speaker 81: That makes sense.

[01:44:10] Speaker 45: That gives us the whole day to do whatever we need to do here. Burn down the place by accident.

[01:44:15] Speaker 1: Let's see, that one over there. I'll leave you guys wondering here. And... keep... While we're waiting all... Two to do.

[01:44:28] Speaker 81: One inch is fine.

[01:44:30] Speaker 1: Yeah. That's what a normal grid is. One inch.

[01:44:32] Speaker 45: How often does she should do that fruit, the health thing?

[01:44:34] Speaker 1: What's that?

[01:44:35] Speaker 45: How often does she do the fruit of health thing?

[01:44:37] Speaker 1: That one she can do as much as she wants.

[01:44:39] Speaker 45: Oh, okay.

[01:44:40] Speaker 1: She has no spells. But a person can only eat it once every... once you've eaten it-

[01:44:44] Speaker 45: Oh, okay.

[01:44:44] Speaker 1: ... you can only get it for 10 minutes.

[01:44:45] Speaker 45: Every 10 minutes. Yeah, okay, I see it now.

[01:44:47] Speaker 1: The reason I chose her specifically to go in this one is that she has done healing you guys on level one. And I don't know how deadly this is and, um-

[01:44:55] Speaker 81: You're gonna try to TPK us at level one, like?

[01:44:57] Speaker 1: Yeah. I want you guys to survive 'cause sometimes what I want to do, it's like, "Well, wait. I want to do something." But, um, you're level one, I can't do too much.

[01:45:06] Speaker 45: Level one's always iffy.

[01:45:08] Speaker 81: Yeah.

[01:45:08] Speaker 1: So I want this to be like the introductory scenarios, but also kind of wanted to get by them. So, I mean, after your... assuming you survive this then you guys should be fine.

[01:45:14] Speaker 81: Do the shutters open on the house?

[01:45:17] Speaker 1: Mm-hmm. You have to be kind of careful because they, uh, um...

[01:45:22] Speaker 81: Can break up?

[01:45:23] Speaker 1: They can, yeah. But they actually do open. For the shutters to happen.

[01:45:31] Speaker 82: (coughs)

[01:45:31] Speaker 45: There's one over here.

[01:45:32] Speaker 1: Yeah, right here.

[01:45:33] Speaker 81: Oh, there's a bunch on this side.

[01:45:34] Speaker 45: Yeah.

[01:45:36] Speaker 82: (coughs)

[01:45:37] Speaker 81: Okay. It doesn't have a grid so we're using tape measures to measure out our movement.

[01:45:44] Speaker 1: And the distances and all that kind of stuff. This is kind of like a trial run too. Um, 'cause there are some other places I want to do. And then, yeah, if it's... if I have to do grid, it's possible, but it's like a whole bunch of extra steps to add grid marks to this. And you'd have to like draw or, uh, use my air... my, uh, air soft painter to do it or stuff like that. So, so but you have to-

[01:46:03] Speaker 80: Projector. (laughs)

[01:46:04] Speaker 82: (laughs)

[01:46:04] Speaker 45: Projects the grid.

[01:46:05] Speaker 80: Yeah.

[01:46:05] Speaker 81: (laughs)

[01:46:06] Speaker 1: I got... I was also debating something, I should just add a TV, which would be not too expensive to do. I would just do a TV and do the auto maps, but then again, I like painting and stuff too, so, um...

[01:46:16] Speaker 81: The physical stuff is more fun.

[01:46:19] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[01:46:19] Speaker 45: The thing about the TV too is like, a lot of your guys have magnets on the bottom.

[01:46:23] Speaker 1: Oh, yeah. I have problems with that. (laughs)

[01:46:24] Speaker 45: It could screw up your TV. Yeah.

[01:46:27] Speaker 1: So you guys are rowing in your boats merrily up the stream. Um, not too bad. It's a gently flowing stream. There's some current behind it, but not the kind of thing you'd want to be fall off in and go down.

[01:46:38] Speaker 81: Are we going with or against the current?

[01:46:40] Speaker 1: Um, against. So basically, you'd be heading-

[01:46:42] Speaker 45: Going north.

[01:46:43] Speaker 1: As you guys are heading north, this is facing down towards the, uh...

[01:46:47] Speaker 81: So this way is north?

[01:46:48] Speaker 1: You can pass. Yeah.

[01:46:48] Speaker 45: Actually, wouldn't that be going downstream because it would be running towards the ocean?

[01:46:52] Speaker 1: Yeah. So basically, um, the... it goes up from the north. If you look from... so the bridge would be down here. You're looking kind of up north at this. And then in... behind us you can see a lot of mountains. The waterfall would be somewhere off in that area. But then you get these tall Himalayan-like mountains that kind of blend in the distance here. So basically, a lot of the water starts coming down this way. It flows this way to Tigran's Crossing. And then if you go down much further, they eventually hit the, uh, ocean. Without that.

[01:47:19] Speaker 81: (coughs)

[01:47:19] Speaker 45: Oh, I thought this was towards the ocean. Okay.

[01:47:21] Speaker 81: So this is-

[01:47:21] Speaker 1: Yeah, this is a way... There's another island on the other side of the bridge and that's where Rosencrantz stays at. But that one's a lot closer.

[01:47:27] Speaker 45: He's to the south, this is to the north, okay.

[01:47:29] Speaker 1: Yeah. Your character will actually have seen it 'cause you'd have taken the rowboat of-... if you went to over with Rosencrantz, you would've seen this place. So eventually there may be a map like this for that too.

[01:47:41] Speaker 45: Yeah, that's unreal.

[01:47:43] Speaker 1: So yeah, as your guys are rolling in, you're getting fairly close. And you can see, um, a bunch of little things popping their heads out of the grass. And, um, one of them kinda shouts a little bit and runs back inside. Um, you see, um, oh, that's basically what you see. So basically, at this point, we can go ahead and roll initiative. Um, let me get...

[01:48:09] Speaker 45: So I'll do red for her initiative.

[01:48:12] Speaker 81: Oh, I can track initiative.

[01:48:14] Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, if you want to do that. Um, our initiative tracker actually is... he's not here today, but... now I'm gonna say you guys can roll your boats about 25 feet, um, around 'cause I mean, you're not as fast as ru- walking, but you don't have to land at the docks. You could choose to land somewhere else, um, should you want. Now there it is. Don't remember where my perception was on here again. And in just a second.

[01:48:55] Speaker 80: Kent hasn't been staring at HeroLance for a year.

[01:48:57] Speaker 81: What is the one that-

[01:48:59] Speaker 45: It's been a little while. (laughs)

[01:49:00] Speaker 81: ... we did in the past? What's it called?

[01:49:02] Speaker 45: Well, it was on that one campaign but it's been a while since I played.

[01:49:04] Speaker 82: I don't know what it's called.

[01:49:04] Speaker 81: I don't know.

[01:49:04] Speaker 80: I got it saved. It was probably like the first thing that popped up when I googled "initiative tracker". You want the one I was using? It's very simple and easy.

[01:49:14] Speaker 45: Yeah.

[01:49:14] Speaker 81: Sure.

[01:49:15] Speaker 80: It's on dm.tools.

[01:49:18] Speaker 1: There's the website. There it is, initiative tracker, the second button on the top. (clears throat)

[01:49:23] Speaker 83: Ah, I see.

[01:49:25] Speaker 1: And it's very generic.

[01:49:26] Speaker 83: Oh, yes.

[01:49:27] Speaker 1: (clears throat) You type in names and initiatives and then click the blue sort button and it'll arrange them. And then if you want to, you can like-

[01:49:34] Speaker 10: Yeah, that's the only thing.

[01:49:34] Speaker 1: ... click next, next, next, next, and it'll keep track of rounds.

[01:49:37] Speaker 83: How do you spell your name, character's name again?

[01:49:39] Speaker 10: It's J-R... For the health, does that, uh, go away at the end of the turn or does it last longer?

[01:49:43] Speaker 1: Um, for the she has?

[01:49:45] Speaker 10: Yeah.

[01:49:45] Speaker 1: That lasts until the end of their next turn.

[01:49:47] Speaker 10: Okay.

[01:49:48] Speaker 1: So either they have to use it with an action or she can create it in her own hand and she can feed it to someone else with an action.

[01:49:54] Speaker 10: Okay. I just couldn't remember if there was, like, a time limit on this. It just seemed like it'd be wise to, like, give everybody a fruit before you go into combat.

[01:50:01] Speaker 1: Yeah, it only lasts until the beginning of, uh, the end of their next turn.

[01:50:03] Speaker 10: Yeah, okay.

[01:50:04] Speaker 1: Um, probably for that reason, that you can't just spam them out like that.

[01:50:09] Speaker 10: Well, no, it makes sense actually. (laughs) So, I just didn't see anything on here and that's why I was kinda wondering.

[01:50:14] Speaker 1: So again, you guys can go to different ones. Um, with the boats, um, so two people rowing, basically you can move a boat 25 feet on one of your... Well, actually we'll just say 40, 20 feet on your turn, but the person who's also in the boat with you can move the boat 20 feet on their turn.

[01:50:33] Speaker 83: Ken, what'd you get?

[01:50:34] Speaker 10: (smacks lips) Uh, so Ulric got a 25. And Ailish got a 23.

[01:50:49] Speaker 83: And what did you get, Erv?

[01:50:51] Speaker 1: Um, I'm called Kotal.

[01:50:54] Speaker 83: Yes.

[01:50:54] Speaker 1: Um, 16. You'll be spelling my name correctly. Kotal. (laughs)

[01:51:06] Speaker 83: (laughs) Cute. I have bad memories of spelling, sorry.

[01:51:09] Speaker 1: No, it's... I was kidding.

[01:51:10] Speaker 10: Oh.

[01:51:11] Speaker 1: It was a joke.

[01:51:11] Speaker 84: Hey, can you hand me that pencil over there?

[01:51:12] Speaker 1: 'Cause it doesn't spell like it sounds, and so I'm just saying-

[01:51:15] Speaker 10: C-O-O-T-A-L-L.

[01:51:17] Speaker 1: Q-O-T-A-L.

[01:51:19] Speaker 10: (laughs) Kotal.

[01:51:21] Speaker 1: Q-O-T-A-L.

[01:51:22] Speaker 10: Kotal. (laughs)

[01:51:23] Speaker 83: You know, that's what I was thinking.

[01:51:27] Speaker 10: All right, so 30 feet. Well, 20 on yours and then-

[01:51:32] Speaker 1: And it's, by the way, almost two hours.

[01:51:34] Speaker 10: What's that? Oh.

[01:51:34] Speaker 1: We don't have Hero. We're talking Hero.

[01:51:36] Speaker 10: Yeah, if you guys wanna roll...

[01:51:38] Speaker 1: We don't have our original ones.

[01:51:40] Speaker 10: Yeah, they never got handed out.

[01:51:41] Speaker 1: Because we didn't-

[01:51:42] Speaker 10: So some people are getting to-

[01:51:42] Speaker 1: We didn't need them yet. I did not win.

[01:51:44] Speaker 10: I did not win.

[01:51:44] Speaker 84: We're timing out extra.

[01:51:46] Speaker 10: Oh, we'll go ahead and lowest one wins this time.

[01:51:49] Speaker 85: Three.

[01:51:49] Speaker 1: So for the first round-

[01:51:51] Speaker 10: (laughs)

[01:51:51] Speaker 84: (laughs)

[01:51:51] Speaker 10: I might not even win that one, the lowest, because I got a, I got a three too. (laughs)

[01:51:55] Speaker 1: Here's your first one and then-

[01:51:56] Speaker 84: I did not win the second one.

[01:51:57] Speaker 1: So for the first roll off, what did everyone get?

[01:52:00] Speaker 10: Three.

[01:52:01] Speaker 84: Three.

[01:52:01] Speaker 83: Two.

[01:52:02] Speaker 10: Wow.

[01:52:02] Speaker 83: (laughs)

[01:52:02] Speaker 1: It's not really two hours, it's one hour and 52 minutes.

[01:52:04] Speaker 10: You did well. Yeah, with a four?

[01:52:06] Speaker 83: (laughs)

[01:52:06] Speaker 84: (laughs)

[01:52:08] Speaker 1: Okay, so between the rest of you guys, second roll off.

[01:52:13] Speaker 10: Nine.

[01:52:14] Speaker 83: 20.

[01:52:14] Speaker 84: 20, oh.

[01:52:15] Speaker 83: Wow, that is a... Okay, so-

[01:52:18] Speaker 10: (laughs) I, I won with a four. (laughs)

[01:52:20] Speaker 84: (laughs)

[01:52:21] Speaker 1: So, you're gonna have-

[01:52:22] Speaker 10: That's pretty bad.

[01:52:23] Speaker 1: ... red one and two, you can put a name. And they're gonna be a 13.

[01:52:27] Speaker 83: How do you... Oh.

[01:52:28] Speaker 1: Just red one and two.

[01:52:29] Speaker 10: Yeah, the color's red.

[01:52:30] Speaker 83: I see it.

[01:52:31] Speaker 1: And then-

[01:52:31] Speaker 83: Red one.

[01:52:33] Speaker 10: Red one and two are a team.

[01:52:35] Speaker 83: Yep.

[01:52:35] Speaker 84: Yeah.

[01:52:35] Speaker 83: Okay.

[01:52:36] Speaker 1: And then red three and four are seven. So I said, um-

[01:52:44] Speaker 10: Yeah, 20 yards, 20 feet for each person.

[01:52:47] Speaker 1: Where do you wanna land?

[01:52:49] Speaker 84: 13.

[01:52:49] Speaker 10: Right on the dock?

[01:52:50] Speaker 1: What? Yeah.

[01:52:52] Speaker 10: That, 'cause-

[01:52:52] Speaker 83: That's it?

[01:52:52] Speaker 10: That's good 'cause that's where we landed.

[01:52:53] Speaker 1: That's how we get off the boat.

[01:52:55] Speaker 83: Okay, top of the-

[01:52:55] Speaker 10: It's not that easy to get off a boat with a 25-foot "All right."

[01:52:59] Speaker 84: Well, it is, just not like-

[01:53:00] Speaker 1: It's gonna crash the boat if there's no rocks or something there.

[01:53:03] Speaker 10: No, I was gonna say, not without getting wet. It's, but it's easy to get off the boat, just-

[01:53:07] Speaker 1: Yeah, safely, I meant.

[01:53:09] Speaker 10: Oh, well.

[01:53:09] Speaker 1: Ulric, you're up.

[01:53:10] Speaker 83: Yeah, you're at the top.

[01:53:11] Speaker 10: All right.

[01:53:12] Speaker 83: With A- with Ailish on deck. Is it 23-

[01:53:15] Speaker 1: Is it 20 feet per round or 20 feet per move action?

[01:53:18] Speaker 84: Um, per round, 'cause boats aren't, the boats aren't the fastest things.

[01:53:21] Speaker 10: All right, so 20 feet from the start of the boats.

[01:53:23] Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, just four inches. Yeah, you could, uh... Is that the, his whole turn?

[01:53:29] Speaker 84: Yep.

[01:53:30] Speaker 1: Okay. Next.

[01:53:31] Speaker 10: Row!

[01:53:32] Speaker 83: Uh, it's Ailish.

[01:53:33] Speaker 10: Row!

[01:53:34] Speaker 83: (laughs)

[01:53:34] Speaker 1: She's going, she's all by herself. Is her boat lighter? Does it go further?

[01:53:38] Speaker 84: Uh, it's a canoe, it uh, it's the same thing for everyone.

[01:53:40] Speaker 10: Row! Oh, yeah, that's good enough.

[01:53:43] Speaker 1: Next.

[01:53:44] Speaker 10: Maybe he just does like a big-

[01:53:45] Speaker 83: Yeah, it's me.

[01:53:46] Speaker 10: ... little bit more than I go.

[01:53:47] Speaker 83: At the 21, uh, row.

[01:53:49] Speaker 1: Where do you wanna go? Y- you're-

[01:53:53] Speaker 84: Can we-

[01:53:54] Speaker 10: Land on the shore?

[01:53:55] Speaker 83: Yeah, probably the shore.

[01:53:57] Speaker 1: Yeah, you can land on the shores if you want to. Getting on the dock-

[01:54:00] Speaker 83: Next.

[01:54:00] Speaker 1: ... is just a straight move. For shore, you're gonna have a five-foot penalty just for climbing off-

[01:54:04] Speaker 10: We're going right up.

[01:54:04] Speaker 1: ... off the boat.

[01:54:05] Speaker 10: That, we're gonna end up right there. That was what that was for.

[01:54:07] Speaker 1: He does take you out, yep, okay.

[01:54:08] Speaker 10: All right, we're there.

[01:54:10] Speaker 83: Next is red one and two.

[01:54:11] Speaker 84: Oh, okay. Red's one and two.

[01:54:13] Speaker 83: They're view, yeah.

[01:54:13] Speaker 84: Red one is there. Um, he will, when his turn to jump out, shout something at you, you have no idea what.

[01:54:20] Speaker 83: At who.

[01:54:21] Speaker 10: At who.

[01:54:21] Speaker 1: And he's taking a shot that, uh, probably the one Kotal is the nearest one to him.

[01:54:26] Speaker 10: What does he look like? Just like that?

[01:54:28] Speaker 1: Kinda like that, yeah. They are sh- these are actually s- um, small. So-

[01:54:33] Speaker 10: He's 35 feet away, if that matters.

[01:54:35] Speaker 1: Uh, yeah, he'll have an increment here. Um, actually, I need to get my... I kinda like using the war games style measurement instead of grids.

[01:54:46] Speaker 10: It is fun.

[01:54:46] Speaker 83: I use-

[01:54:47] Speaker 1: You don't have to count the stupid diagonals.

[01:54:49] Speaker 10: (laughs) Diagonals suck. That's the one thing about like, that's the nice thing about the house rule where each diagonal does not count twice.

[01:54:57] Speaker 83: I was so close on getting that piece-

[01:54:58] Speaker 1: Well, I mean, this is more accurate 'cause you're like-
