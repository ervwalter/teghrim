DURATION:6095.603
[01:54:59] Speaker 1: You're actually measuring the diagonal.

[01:55:01] Speaker 2: Yeah. Um, that would be... He's gonna have one increment on here.

[01:55:06] Speaker 3: How are we doing inches to feet?

[01:55:08] Speaker 1: Uh, every inch is five feet-

[01:55:10] Speaker 3: Okay.

[01:55:10] Speaker 1: ... in a normal grid.

[01:55:11] Speaker 2: Yeah, luckily everything in Pathfinders-

[01:55:13] Speaker 4: Everywhere.

[01:55:13] Speaker 2: ... divisions are why fight for the most part.

[01:55:14] Speaker 4: Nice.

[01:55:14] Speaker 2: So it also works out really good. Um, that's gonna be, that'll be a 19 minus... It's two for each increment, as memory serves.

[01:55:21] Speaker 1: So each inch is a square basically, so.

[01:55:23] Speaker 2: Um-

[01:55:23] Speaker 4: Every square.

[01:55:24] Speaker 2: So that would be a 17 unquoted.

[01:55:26] Speaker 1: Uh, no.

[01:55:27] Speaker 2: Nope, I missed.

[01:55:28] Speaker 1: It was 19 until I paid him.

[01:55:29] Speaker 2: And then he's going to jump back into some cover behind some bushes. And then I'll, I'll also put something in there at initiative zero and call it, um... We're gonna put it in as initiative 30 and call it, um, Surprise.

[01:55:47] Speaker 4: What are your actions?

[01:55:48] Speaker 1: Surprise.

[01:55:49] Speaker 2: Uh, just call it Upkeep. That just tells me it's the beginning of a new round basically. 'Cause they're-

[01:55:55] Speaker 1: Next.

[01:55:56] Speaker 2: Um, yep, next.

[01:55:57] Speaker 3: Ah.

[01:55:57] Speaker 1: Oh, that was only one.

[01:55:58] Speaker 4: One of four.

[01:55:58] Speaker 1: Just two when you do something?

[01:55:59] Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, Two, same deal. He's going-

[01:56:02] Speaker 5: Arnor is up next.

[01:56:03] Speaker 2: I'm guessing he's going to be at one increment there. Um-

[01:56:05] Speaker 5: I'm at the seven.

[01:56:06] Speaker 2: That's-

[01:56:07] Speaker 4: Yeah, that's going to be farther.

[01:56:08] Speaker 2: He's going to be the closest one.

[01:56:09] Speaker 3: Further than-

[01:56:10] Speaker 2: He's still in... Within tw- Um, yeah, he's over one increment, less than two, so.

[01:56:15] Speaker 4: Yeah.

[01:56:15] Speaker 2: It's a long range shot, but he'll take it. Ah, I know he's going to miss horribly.

[01:56:19] Speaker 4: Why is he at 20?

[01:56:21] Speaker 2: Eh. I'm going back to hiding.

[01:56:23] Speaker 1: Next.

[01:56:23] Speaker 5: Arnor and Red Three and Four tied with a seven.

[01:56:27] Speaker 2: Monsters go first.

[01:56:28] Speaker 1: He can't get there.

[01:56:30] Speaker 2: So Monsters-

[01:56:31] Speaker 1: Oh, Monster goes first.

[01:56:31] Speaker 2: You've got to put them at higher initiative. Yeah, monsters go first unless... There is a feat if you take the improved initiative, then it says if you tie a monster, you go first.

[01:56:38] Speaker 5: Mm.

[01:56:38] Speaker 2: Um, Three yelps something and then he will... Let me see, I'll need that. He's gonna-

[01:56:47] Speaker 5: And then after Red Three and Four is the, uh, Upkeep.

[01:56:52] Speaker 2: Let's see if he zigzags. He's just gonna triple move over the tree. And then Four... That's a trap, he's gonna-

[01:57:07] Speaker 5: What challenge check is this?

[01:57:07] Speaker 2: He's gonna do likewise and he's gonna hide back there. Okay. Then Arnor.

[01:57:14] Speaker 3: Um, it's probably worth just continuing to row the boat and get it moved closer.

[01:57:25] Speaker 2: Oh, this is Willow.

[01:57:28] Speaker 5: Willow?

[01:57:28] Speaker 3: Whoa.

[01:57:28] Speaker 2: Look... Willow.

[01:57:29] Speaker 3: Willow?

[01:57:29] Speaker 5: Oh.

[01:57:30] Speaker 3: This is a classic. They don't come much around.

[01:57:31] Speaker 4: Okay.

[01:57:31] Speaker 1: It's my turn.

[01:57:32] Speaker 2: Go for it.

[01:57:33] Speaker 3: Well, they tried to redo it, it just sucked so bad that movie.

[01:57:36] Speaker 4: Yeah.

[01:57:36] Speaker 3: It disappeared from like, Disney in like, what was like, a month. (laughs)

[01:57:40] Speaker 5: Uh, Arnor was dead at the bottom, next is Upkeep.

[01:57:42] Speaker 2: Upkeep?

[01:57:43] Speaker 5: Top of the round.

[01:57:43] Speaker 2: Okay. So at Upkeep if you want to-

[01:57:45] Speaker 3: I watched the first episode. It was really bad.

[01:57:47] Speaker 2: Um, second is a new character that's going to be entering in. Um, uh, she'll be coming in on a 20. So just put, um-

[01:57:59] Speaker 3: Val Kilmer back in the day.

[01:58:03] Speaker 2: Leader chick? I don't know. It's just-

[01:58:05] Speaker 5: Leader at a 20?

[01:58:07] Speaker 2: Yeah. You see there's a little place under there?

[01:58:12] Speaker 3: Yeah.

[01:58:12] Speaker 2: It's a little porch. It's really hard to see but-

[01:58:15] Speaker 4: Yep, yep.

[01:58:15] Speaker 2: You see her face pop up there, she yelps something at you. Um, shout something in a language you guys probably aren't particularly familiar with.

[01:58:22] Speaker 3: No.

[01:58:22] Speaker 2: And then she runs back inside and shuts the door.

[01:58:24] Speaker 5: Depends on what language she says.

[01:58:25] Speaker 1: Next.

[01:58:27] Speaker 4: Um.

[01:58:27] Speaker 5: Um.

[01:58:28] Speaker 2: And then, and then add in another two.

[01:58:33] Speaker 5: Next is-

[01:58:33] Speaker 2: Oh. And they're going to enter in on a... So, so this do this as... Oh, that's a natural 20. So for a 22.

[01:58:44] Speaker 1: Ha, they're very perceptive. (laughs)

[01:58:46] Speaker 2: (laughs) Enter Red Five and Red Six.

[01:58:49] Speaker 5: Red Five and Six.

[01:58:52] Speaker 1: There. There you go.

[01:58:53] Speaker 5: That's it?

[01:58:54] Speaker 2: Yep, they enter just-

[01:58:55] Speaker 1: Just another pair.

[01:58:56] Speaker 2: You guys don't exactly have to carry them.

[01:58:57] Speaker 3: Little bastards.

[01:58:58] Speaker 5: Anymore?

[01:59:00] Speaker 4: Again, you're around.

[01:59:00] Speaker 1: It's all right.

[01:59:00] Speaker 2: Oh, nope, so now we go to the top of the round or beginning of the round.

[01:59:03] Speaker 5: Uh, Elrick, 25 Daelish on deck.

[01:59:07] Speaker 3: Um, you little fuckers. Ah, I'm not going to move that far. Uh, he's probably got cover there though.

[01:59:23] Speaker 5: You can see one of-

[01:59:25] Speaker 1: I just ordered a ton of little tiny things.

[01:59:28] Speaker 2: (laughs)

[01:59:29] Speaker 1: They have those next week.

[01:59:30] Speaker 2: Um, other type... And I know I have some around here, I just don't know, 'cause for board game uses all the time.

[01:59:35] Speaker 1: Yeah. This was, uh, like, board games

[01:59:37] Speaker 6: Is that a cane your mini is holding?

[01:59:38] Speaker 1: They were like five bucks on Amazon, so-

[01:59:40] Speaker 4: Yeah.

[01:59:40] Speaker 1: I got like four or five of them coming.

[01:59:41] Speaker 4: That's Yurgi.

[01:59:43] Speaker 6: Coming our way over here.

[01:59:43] Speaker 1: It's not actually my character. It's Craig's.

[01:59:45] Speaker 4: He's like an old geriatric like, barbarian.

[01:59:48] Speaker 1: You just don't have the right mini yet.

[01:59:49] Speaker 4: Yeah.

[01:59:49] Speaker 1: It's okay.

[01:59:50] Speaker 2: He was named after... If there's a... I think on your watch, it was Hornet Barbarian.

[01:59:53] Speaker 4: Yeah, yeah.

[01:59:54] Speaker 2: Cohen. Yeah, you saw that right? The little short they did for that?

[01:59:57] Speaker 4: No. What? Oh, yeah. I'm the one that sent you that.

[02:00:00] Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right. Yeah.

[02:00:00] Speaker 4: (laughs) With the horse.

[02:00:02] Speaker 2: Yeah.

[02:00:02] Speaker 4: (laughs)

[02:00:04] Speaker 2: And-

[02:00:04] Speaker 4: Ah, I'm sure he's got cover but I'm gonna try to shoot at number one anyway.

[02:00:09] Speaker 2: Yep.

[02:00:09] Speaker 6: Will you baby him?

[02:00:10] Speaker 4: Actually, what's the distance? Okay, well.

[02:00:18] Speaker 6: What are you, wheelie?

[02:00:20] Speaker 4: Uh, spell. So I'm gonna go over here and then I'm gonna shoot at him.

[02:00:24] Speaker 2: Oh. Now, still if those are tall bushes, will my hair cover?

[02:00:27] Speaker 4: Yeah.

[02:00:28] Speaker 1: Lasser?

[02:00:29] Speaker 3: Yeah, I am going to cast a spell that is a 19 for a, uh... I'm gonna try a divine lance at them. I don't know what he is.

[02:00:36] Speaker 2: 19 will hit.

[02:00:37] Speaker 3: Okay. Uh, I gotta look up the damage.

[02:00:45] Speaker 5: Or I hear the clarion call.

[02:00:47] Speaker 3: Yeah. So, 2D4 spirit. (instrumental music) I think it does more if they're undead, which I don't know if they are.

[02:01:06] Speaker 2: It doesn't actually say anything about that. Okay. Six points of spear damage. Okay, he falls over dead.

[02:01:14] Speaker 7: He, he, he fell dead.

[02:01:15] Speaker 8: You shouldn't have attacked us you little fuckers.

[02:01:17] Speaker 2: Just put them on the side there so we can see some casualties.

[02:01:19] Speaker 8: Bodies? Yep.

[02:01:21] Speaker 9: She has the reach... rage ticket there.

[02:01:23] Speaker 2: Okay. She will hop off that, uh-

[02:01:26] Speaker 8: How much are you-

[02:01:27] Speaker 9: That was her 20 feet.

[02:01:28] Speaker 2: Okay. Next up?

[02:01:29] Speaker 7: Red, five and six.

[02:01:31] Speaker 2: Five and six. You guys don't know where they are because you can't see them.

[02:01:36] Speaker 7: Oh, okay. Then it's me. Uh, get to the shore.

[02:01:39] Speaker 9: You have enough to get to the shore.

[02:01:43] Speaker 2: Okay, next up?

[02:01:43] Speaker 7: No, it's your... It... Your turn is moving the boat.

[02:01:46] Speaker 8: Yes.

[02:01:46] Speaker 9: Yeah. It's all three actions, to move the boat.

[02:01:48] Speaker 8: Now are you gonna secure your boat?

[02:01:51] Speaker 9: If it's very still.

[02:01:53] Speaker 8: So, we're supposed to be running-

[02:01:54] Speaker 7: Uh, leadership.

[02:01:55] Speaker 9: And there's like weird physics because of the location of the island.

[02:01:58] Speaker 2: Oh, 'cause you don't see her, she doesn't have anything.

[02:01:58] Speaker 8: (laughs) Yeah, okay.

[02:01:58] Speaker 9: That one spot is very still.

[02:02:00] Speaker 2: (laughs) Oh, yeah, okay.

[02:02:01] Speaker 9: Yeah, I'm the skipper.

[02:02:02] Speaker 7: Quota.

[02:02:04] Speaker 9: I am called Kotal.

[02:02:05] Speaker 7: Kotal.

[02:02:06] Speaker 2: (laughs)

[02:02:06] Speaker 9: No, Kua.

[02:02:07] Speaker 7: Kua.

[02:02:07] Speaker 9: Kuo. Koe. Tal. Koe Tal.

[02:02:10] Speaker 2: (laughs)

[02:02:11] Speaker 7: Koe Tal. Okay.

[02:02:12] Speaker 9: It wants to be spelled K-O-T-A-L, but it's not, because he's mysterious.

[02:02:18] Speaker 7: Red one and two are on deck.

[02:02:19] Speaker 8: Uh, I'm gonna move twice probably. Yeah, roughly. His head is, is the number. He's going to go there. And that's two actions and then flurry on that little bastard. On red too. Nice. They add 13. These guys are shitty. How many?

[02:02:49] Speaker 9: They might hit.

[02:02:50] Speaker 2: AC is 30 or 13. (laughs)

[02:02:52] Speaker 8: Oh, I was gonna say 30.

[02:02:53] Speaker 7: (laughs) We're repeating it.

[02:02:54] Speaker 8: We're done. We're done. (laughs) I... It is back out on the boat. (laughs)

[02:02:58] Speaker 10: It is back out on the boat. (laughs)

[02:03:01] Speaker 9: (laughs)

[02:03:01] Speaker 8: I told you the house burned down.

[02:03:02] Speaker 7: (laughs)

[02:03:03] Speaker 9: (laughs) That is a 13 so that is nine points of bludgeoning damage.

[02:03:07] Speaker 8: Oh, almost done.

[02:03:08] Speaker 9: (laughs) Um, and I will... My other flurry will just go into the air.

[02:03:12] Speaker 2: Yeah. (laughs)

[02:03:12] Speaker 9: Because there's nothing else there.

[02:03:15] Speaker 2: You step on him because he called you Kote- Kotal.

[02:03:17] Speaker 9: (laughs)

[02:03:18] Speaker 2: It was Koe Tal.

[02:03:18] Speaker 8: He's going to punch you there for a fact. Oh, yeah.

[02:03:21] Speaker 9: No, this is all... I'm all about, like, the staff.

[02:03:24] Speaker 7: Is that your turn?

[02:03:25] Speaker 2: More and more, yeah.

[02:03:26] Speaker 8: You just like how it started. Yeah.

[02:03:26] Speaker 9: That was three actions.

[02:03:27] Speaker 7: Uh, red one and two, and red three and four are down.

[02:03:30] Speaker 8: They're cool.

[02:03:30] Speaker 2: Red one and two are dead.

[02:03:31] Speaker 8: Yeah.

[02:03:31] Speaker 2: You may remove them.

[02:03:32] Speaker 7: Okay, red three and four-

[02:03:34] Speaker 9: They're staying dead, right? You didn't remove them.

[02:03:36] Speaker 2: I didn't, well I was putting capitals on the board, making it look-

[02:03:38] Speaker 9: Okay. Well, I didn't know if she should not remove them.

[02:03:40] Speaker 2: No, you can remove them from the initiative.

[02:03:41] Speaker 7: Delayed.

[02:03:42] Speaker 2: Um, though, well, actually I... Yeah. Um, if I introduce them, they'll be introduced as a new batch, so-

[02:03:46] Speaker 9: A new initiative.

[02:03:48] Speaker 2: Um, but three and four, um, this one will probably just go three inches out. Let's see, where's that at? There.

[02:03:57] Speaker 8: And attack Kotal.

[02:03:57] Speaker 2: Um, oh wait, I have to load, so...

[02:03:59] Speaker 9: Kotal. Kotal. Ko-tal. Kotal.

[02:04:03] Speaker 2: He's shooting from behind cover.

[02:04:05] Speaker 8: Okay.

[02:04:05] Speaker 2: And he's going to be up one increment.

[02:04:07] Speaker 8: Where'd you get your name from?

[02:04:09] Speaker 9: Uh, I made it up.

[02:04:12] Speaker 2: Hm. Where it is? Nope, that's gonna miss.

[02:04:16] Speaker 8: Is that in ducks back into cover?

[02:04:17] Speaker 2: Um, this one's... Yeah, then he'll duck back into cover. Same thing with these guys. You notice as they move they seem to have the ability to reload as they move.

[02:04:26] Speaker 8: That's fine. Little bastards.

[02:04:28] Speaker 2: So, he actually does have-

[02:04:30] Speaker 8: What are they attacking with?

[02:04:31] Speaker 2: ... enough range.

[02:04:32] Speaker 8: Those are little crossbows?

[02:04:34] Speaker 2: Uh, bows.

[02:04:35] Speaker 8: Oh.

[02:04:35] Speaker 2: Like a mini short bow. Um, so we're gonna do even, odd. Odd.

[02:04:42] Speaker 8: Because you said you were going to-

[02:04:43] Speaker 2: So he's shooting at Aurelia. Um, that is a thir... Or no, that's a 16 to hit.

[02:04:49] Speaker 7: Miss. Which one shot at me?

[02:04:51] Speaker 2: This guy right here.

[02:04:52] Speaker 7: Oh. No, that's 16 misses.

[02:04:55] Speaker 2: Um, that's it for them.

[02:04:56] Speaker 7: (laughs) Um, Arnor is next.

[02:04:59] Speaker 9: Uh, you could do something now. You're not on... You can get off the boat.

[02:05:02] Speaker 2: So, the first step will be difficult terrain, but after that it's just regular.

[02:05:05] Speaker 8: (coughs)

[02:05:06] Speaker 2: Because you guys are not on the dock, you're on a-

[02:05:08] Speaker 7: I'm on a boat.

[02:05:09] Speaker 8: On a boat.

[02:05:10] Speaker 9: Trying to hop onto the... You should have gone earlier and then you could have taken the dock spot, but we beat you to it. (laughs)

[02:05:19] Speaker 7: You're faster. Your, uh, muscular arms are more powerful than mine.

[02:05:24] Speaker 9: Our perception was higher and our initiative roles were higher.

[02:05:27] Speaker 8: (laughs)

[02:05:28] Speaker 7: Well, yeah, I don't-

[02:05:29] Speaker 8: That's old man quickness is how that happened.

[02:05:31] Speaker 9: Only because we got there first.

[02:05:37] Speaker 11: (coughs) And from here I should sort of be able to see that one.

[02:05:56] Speaker 2: Yep.

[02:05:56] Speaker 11: All right. So if you don't

[02:05:58] Speaker 12: have any cover there either. It's not far behind a bush.

[02:06:02] Speaker 11: Cool. All right. Then I use my favorite hand trick, needle darts.

[02:06:07] Speaker 2: (laughs)

[02:06:07] Speaker 11: Boom.

[02:06:09] Speaker 7: That's your favorite hand trick?

[02:06:10] Speaker 11: With this character. All right, so that would be a 21 to hit.

[02:06:18] Speaker 2: That'll hit.

[02:06:20] Speaker 9: 13 hit, so...

[02:06:21] Speaker 11: Mm-hmm. All right.

[02:06:24] Speaker 9: I think you're good with the 21.

[02:06:33] Speaker 11: And that'll be eight points of damage.

[02:06:34] Speaker 2: Oh. And he goes down.

[02:06:37] Speaker 11: All right. That'll be my turn.

[02:06:40] Speaker 7: Okay, next is upkeep.

[02:06:42] Speaker 2: Oh. So if you want to enter in (clears throat), red... I think the next group is-

[02:06:50] Speaker 9: Seven and eight.

[02:06:52] Speaker 2: Let's see. Well, we have six and seven out already, don't we?

[02:06:54] Speaker 7: We have five and six.

[02:06:56] Speaker 2: Let's see if five and six... I got them all in there somewhere.

[02:06:58] Speaker 7: So we need seven and eight would be next.

[02:07:02] Speaker 2: There's five and there's five from this one. So you have... You can enter in red seven and eight at initiative 13, and nine and 10.

[02:07:15] Speaker 13: Gotta figure out what way to get a fire spell.

[02:07:19] Speaker 14: A what spell?

[02:07:19] Speaker 2: Add a 20.

[02:07:20] Speaker 13: Fire.

[02:07:22] Speaker 14: Take the fire spell. Ignite? What's produce flame called?

[02:07:28] Speaker 13: I don't think I had that on when I spelled it.

[02:07:29] Speaker 15: Ignition, I think?

[02:07:30] Speaker 14: Ignition.

[02:07:31] Speaker 15: I think is what they renamed it to.

[02:07:34] Speaker 2: That's wrong.

[02:07:35] Speaker 15: I know there's primal stuff.

[02:07:36] Speaker 2: Primal and, uh-

[02:07:37] Speaker 14: Uh, okay.

[02:07:38] Speaker 2: I don't know that's on, like, divine though.

[02:07:40] Speaker 14: Yeah, I don't know what divine ...

[02:07:42] Speaker 2: And that's...

[02:07:43] Speaker 15: Natal-Dark, it prevents-

[02:07:44] Speaker 2: If there's new stuff I just get.

[02:07:45] Speaker 14: I mean, Netal-Dark does the best divine enchantress probably.

[02:07:47] Speaker 13: Yeah.

[02:07:48] Speaker 15: What? Uh, you have nine and 10, that, that's it?

[02:07:50] Speaker 2: Yep.

[02:07:51] Speaker 15: Uh, okay. After upkeep, it's Auric. Here, no one's beat you yet.

[02:07:56] Speaker 2: Mm.

[02:07:57] Speaker 15: Auric and Ailish. I can't see produces flame being more-

[02:08:03] Speaker 13: (clears throat)

[02:08:03] Speaker 15: ... divine than arcane.

[02:08:05] Speaker 14: Hmm, no worries.

[02:08:07] Speaker 13: So there's one, two. Hmm. Take cover behind the bush.

[02:08:26] Speaker 2: Okay. Next up.

[02:08:27] Speaker 15: Ailish.

[02:08:30] Speaker 14: What's her speed?

[02:08:32] Speaker 13: 35.

[02:08:33] Speaker 14: Fuck. Of damn elf.

[02:08:34] Speaker 2: I'm gonna she's an elf.

[02:08:35] Speaker 15: Elf.

[02:08:35] Speaker 13: That's one.

[02:08:43] Speaker 2: And I mean he's really cool, but she's not the most practical for cooking purposes.

[02:08:46] Speaker 13: (laughs) She's kinda, like, side heavy.

[02:08:48] Speaker 2: Yeah.

[02:08:49] Speaker 14: Watch out. This is the nice part of terrain.

[02:08:52] Speaker 13: Line of sight?

[02:08:52] Speaker 14: Yeah. Kotal cannot see them coming around the yard.

[02:08:56] Speaker 13: Nope.

[02:08:58] Speaker 14: They just are-

[02:08:58] Speaker 15: Is that her turn?

[02:08:58] Speaker 14: ... covered by a little, a little bit of the bush. If they were taller, he might be able to see them.

[02:09:04] Speaker 13: Can Ailish see anything through the front doors? Are they open?

[02:09:07] Speaker 14: Nope, they seem to be shut.

[02:09:08] Speaker 13: What about that girl on the, uh, balcony?

[02:09:10] Speaker 2: Um, from the balcony, appears to be empty. You don't see no one out there.

[02:09:13] Speaker 13: (sighs) Hmm. Well, she's got 35 more feet for the second or third action, so... You saw him, so she's gonna take cover behind the bush.

[02:09:43] Speaker 14: Okay.

[02:09:44] Speaker 15: After her is red, five and six.

[02:09:47] Speaker 2: Oh, five and six. Let's see if... Yeah.

[02:10:03] Speaker 14: You might hear some rustling.

[02:10:07] Speaker 2: It's all but you may not. Yeah, I don't have produce flame or ignite.

[02:10:18] Speaker 14: Okay, it's five and six. Yeah, produce flame doesn't exist anymore and-

[02:10:21] Speaker 2: Who's up next?

[02:10:21] Speaker 14: ... remember back to rustling.

[02:10:22] Speaker 15: It's called ignition.

[02:10:23] Speaker 2: Or ignition, yeah, that's what I'm saying. Yeah.

[02:10:24] Speaker 15: Oh. Oh, after them it's me.

[02:10:26] Speaker 2: Either one of them. Okay.

[02:10:28] Speaker 15: So it's difficult terrain to get off the boat?

[02:10:30] Speaker 2: Just the one square, so 10 feet to get off, then you have the rest of your movement after that.

[02:10:33] Speaker 15: Okay, so 20, 10 and then 20. What does 20 feet look like? Do you-

[02:10:39] Speaker 2: Mm.

[02:10:39] Speaker 15: I can't reach over there. Could you measure it out please?

[02:10:42] Speaker 2: Oh, you can... I mean, that'd be five inches if you have 20, so anywhere kind of right in that area.

[02:10:46] Speaker 13: Four inches.

[02:10:48] Speaker 2: Yeah, 20 would be four. So...

[02:10:51] Speaker 15: Um.

[02:10:56] Speaker 2: You kind of have to go around this area, 'cause that's all thick brush right there. Unless you wanna go through it, but that would be-

[02:11:00] Speaker 13: You could take cover in it.

[02:11:03] Speaker 15: Can I get between the two little bushes?

[02:11:05] Speaker 2: Yeah, if you're gonna plow through it, it might be a difficult, but you can, you can get, like, in front of them easily enough. Or, like, if you went like...

[02:11:14] Speaker 15: Or if I wanted to, like, hide behind it, or take some cover any way behind it?

[02:11:19] Speaker 2: Yeah, and there is a take cover action. So, like, you can go three inches up to the edge of it. If you take it, then there's a take cover action, which actually lets you use your stealth to hide.

[02:11:28] Speaker 15: Oh yeah, I'll do that.

[02:11:31] Speaker 2: So that'd be two actions. Not much you can do unless another action, unless you wanna move again.

[02:11:36] Speaker 15: Mm-mm.

[02:11:37] Speaker 2: Or you could try to shoot, um, yeah.

[02:11:39] Speaker 15: Not yet, so roll stealth check. Secret or not secret?

[02:11:46] Speaker 2: I'm just going with not secret on that, so.

[02:11:47] Speaker 14: Yeah, there's not a lot of fire.

[02:11:49] Speaker 15: 12.

[02:11:50] Speaker 14: The only, uh-

[02:11:51] Speaker 2: Oh.

[02:11:51] Speaker 14: ... cantrip with the fire trait is illuminate.

[02:11:54] Speaker 2: Um, next up?

[02:11:55] Speaker 15: Uh, and it's leader Chimp.

[02:11:56] Speaker 13: That doesn't, like, actually damage anything.

[02:11:59] Speaker 15: And then red, nine and 10, are up next.

[02:12:01] Speaker 14: And then you, like, second rank. Second rank is before you get a fire spell.

[02:12:03] Speaker 2: We also hear this door open. She pops her head out of the-

[02:12:06] Speaker 15: There's a-

[02:12:07] Speaker 2: ... balcony there.

[02:12:09] Speaker 13: One where I can turn my weapon into fire.

[02:12:11] Speaker 15: Isn't that-

[02:12:13] Speaker 2: Flaming blade.

[02:12:13] Speaker 15: I'm losing armory? That's level two?

[02:12:15] Speaker 13: Yeah.

[02:12:17] Speaker 15: Mm-hmm.

[02:12:17] Speaker 14: What's that?

[02:12:18] Speaker 15: Oh, I said flaming blade, but then I realized that doesn't exist in Talquinar.

[02:12:22] Speaker 13: That's basically what it is, uh, just what you make a flaming weapon in your hand of your choice.

[02:12:26] Speaker 15: That's when one spell I could have cast but I- I told you the house was gonna burn down.

[02:12:39] Speaker 2: And then she moves back into the house. That's it for her?

[02:12:42] Speaker 15: That one came back uh, way up.

[02:12:45] Speaker 13: So do that as a-

[02:12:45] Speaker 2: She stands back into it.

[02:12:47] Speaker 13: It'll happen on her initiative next.

[02:12:49] Speaker 15: Oh.

[02:12:50] Speaker 2: It pops up, it would have... With rate that spells it had to have one action, which he uses to stand up.

[02:12:55] Speaker 13: Told you there was gonna be fire damage on this house.

[02:12:58] Speaker 2: (laughs)

[02:12:58] Speaker 13: (laughs) I told them.

[02:13:00] Speaker 15: Is that her turn?

[02:13:01] Speaker 2: Yep.

[02:13:02] Speaker 15: Nine and 10.

[02:13:03] Speaker 14: Where does she... Where did this come from?

[02:13:05] Speaker 2: She came through here.

[02:13:05] Speaker 15: She came on the balcony.

[02:13:06] Speaker 2: Raised him, and then she went back inside. Well, no, because she didn't go back in here, she's standing-

[02:13:12] Speaker 13: She's still standing?

[02:13:13] Speaker 2: She's kind of standing in the doorway. She'd have significant cover though, 'cause there's a lot of cover there.Um, who is up next?

[02:13:23] Speaker 16: Nine and 10.

[02:13:24] Speaker 2: Nine and 10.

[02:13:24] Speaker 17: Climb there.

[02:13:25] Speaker 9: I'm gonna try and climb up there. I'm, like, an acrobatic monkey dude.

[02:13:28] Speaker 2: Arnar sees some guys-

[02:13:30] Speaker 9: It might not be this round.

[02:13:31] Speaker 16: Kotal-

[02:13:32] Speaker 2: Kotal... Arnar, yeah. He sees a movement on the side of this building here.

[02:13:35] Speaker 16: ... you're up next.

[02:13:36] Speaker 2: Next up? Or Kotal then?

[02:13:38] Speaker 16: Yeah.

[02:13:39] Speaker 9: I want to... I don't know if my mini will balance there, so we'll just... Wait a minute, you're really gonna make me lift up the house, huh?

[02:13:49] Speaker 16: Yeah.

[02:13:49] Speaker 9: It's gonna take me two actions, I want to climb up on it.

[02:13:52] Speaker 17: Yeah, we'd totally go into the house.

[02:13:53] Speaker 9: There.

[02:13:54] Speaker 17: Climbs up on the second level.

[02:13:54] Speaker 2: That's two actions.

[02:13:55] Speaker 16: You brought out this awesome house where tars are in-

[02:13:58] Speaker 9: Hold on. I gotta re- rewrite the rules.

[02:14:00] Speaker 16: Seven and eight are up next.

[02:14:04] Speaker 2: I'll just move them now while he's looking that up.

[02:14:08] Speaker 16: And then-

[02:14:08] Speaker 2: So he doesn't see anything but...

[02:14:11] Speaker 16: Three and four are after them.

[02:14:13] Speaker 2: They run off and take cover.

[02:14:17] Speaker 9: I want to high jump. Um, I was making sure that grab an edge was a r- was a reaction.

[02:14:28] Speaker 17: (laughs)

[02:14:29] Speaker 2: It is, so, uh, it, it is about five feet to the edge of that roof, I measured. Um, and I have quick jump so I don't have to stride.

[02:14:40] Speaker 16: Don't punch it.

[02:14:42] Speaker 9: So I just want to try and jump up and grab the edge-

[02:14:46] Speaker 16: Piece fell off.

[02:14:46] Speaker 9: ... of that roof. Mm.

[02:14:49] Speaker 2: Yeah, some of these things are-

[02:14:50] Speaker 9: It is a-

[02:14:52] Speaker 16: Is that a magnet? Or did it actually break?

[02:14:53] Speaker 2: No, I don't think it's a magnet. It's just hard to glue it back in.

[02:14:56] Speaker 16: Oh.

[02:14:56] Speaker 2: They're, they're not... With the way this printing works sometimes, it just gets a little...

[02:14:59] Speaker 16: Sad face.

[02:15:00] Speaker 2: Let's see. Try and slide that back. I didn't realize that wasn't level. 'Cause yeah, there's a little spot right there, wh-

[02:15:08] Speaker 16: This is why you hate this house?

[02:15:09] Speaker 2: No, but we'll get to it when you guys ever get into it.

[02:15:12] Speaker 9: Athletics, athletics, athletics. It is an athletics check. It is a... Athletics check, I am not going to succeed.

[02:15:20] Speaker 17: What is it?

[02:15:20] Speaker 9: Uh, DC three.

[02:15:21] Speaker 17: Oh, what is that?

[02:15:22] Speaker 9: But I don't have to succeed in order to get only that high. (laughs)

[02:15:25] Speaker 17: (laughs)

[02:15:26] Speaker 9: Like, if I succeed someday, I'll be good at this, I'll be able to go higher. (knocking) I can roll a 20.

[02:15:33] Speaker 17: Oh, look at that.

[02:15:34] Speaker 16: (laughs)

[02:15:35] Speaker 9: That is a, uh, 27 on the die.

[02:15:39] Speaker 16: Asking yourself, "Shall we see if-"

[02:15:40] Speaker 9: Which, which is, which is a failure which becomes a success. Um, so (laughs) now I have to grasp an edge, which was the rule I was looking up.

[02:15:47] Speaker 2: Oh.

[02:15:48] Speaker 9: Which is make a acrobatics check. I don't know what the DC is. Whatever you decide the DC is.

[02:15:56] Speaker 2: This one, I don't think it'd be that difficult 'cause it's-

[02:15:58] Speaker 9: 'Cause I just wanna, like, grab an edge. And it'll have to be next round where I will actually climb.

[02:16:02] Speaker 17: You can just grab the edge of the roof.

[02:16:03] Speaker 9: Yeah, 'cause next round I'll pull myself up. It's still there.

[02:16:07] Speaker 2: That'd be a failure, easily.

[02:16:12] Speaker 17: Ah, 24.

[02:16:12] Speaker 9: So I'm like hanging. Next round I'll pull myself up. That's three actions.

[02:16:15] Speaker 16: So you... I saw you move seven and eight. Three and four were after seven and eight.

[02:16:21] Speaker 17: Yeah, I moved them. Or no, seven... Okay, three and four. Um-

[02:16:25] Speaker 9: Yeah, I mean, there's, like, magic shit coming out of this window.

[02:16:27] Speaker 17: Yeah.

[02:16:27] Speaker 9: I'm going in the window.

[02:16:28] Speaker 17: Yeah.

[02:16:28] Speaker 2: This one can kinda see Yurgi, um... Or not Yurgi, but Yurgi's manager.

[02:16:34] Speaker 9: He's an athletics acrobatics specialist.

[02:16:36] Speaker 2: Yeah, he has-

[02:16:37] Speaker 9: That's what he does.

[02:16:38] Speaker 16: Monks.

[02:16:39] Speaker 17: No, Yurgi definitely is.

[02:16:39] Speaker 16: Welcome to monks.

[02:16:41] Speaker 17: Yurgi is definitely, like, athletic so-

[02:16:43] Speaker 2: So that'd be a 24-

[02:16:43] Speaker 9: Non-Yurgi.

[02:16:44] Speaker 2: ... to hit Olgar.

[02:16:45] Speaker 9: I'm gonna confuse the AI.

[02:16:46] Speaker 17: (laughs)

[02:16:49] Speaker 9: Olric. There is no Yurgi.

[02:16:50] Speaker 17: He's attacking the-

[02:16:51] Speaker 9: Olric.

[02:16:51] Speaker 17: Maybe, yeah, this one hit.

[02:16:51] Speaker 9: Anytime someone says Yurgi, it means Olric.

[02:16:53] Speaker 16: Yeah.

[02:16:54] Speaker 9: Make a note.

[02:16:55] Speaker 2: What's, what's he... He rolled a 24.

[02:16:56] Speaker 17: Oh, that's a hit.

[02:16:56] Speaker 2: For two points.

[02:16:58] Speaker 17: Okay.

[02:17:01] Speaker 2: Um...

[02:17:03] Speaker 16: You're a 10 for that.

[02:17:04] Speaker 2: He can at least see two. Um, I don't...

[02:17:08] Speaker 17: Uh.

[02:17:09] Speaker 2: Stealth is versus perception DC, right?

[02:17:11] Speaker 9: Yes. I rolled a-

[02:17:13] Speaker 2: 'Cause you only rolled a 12, so-

[02:17:14] Speaker 16: I was gonna say, I rolled a 12.

[02:17:15] Speaker 2: He knows someone's there and he knows someone's there, so he with... After a shot, is going to...

[02:17:19] Speaker 9: But I have a perception of plus two, which I happen to know. (laughs)

[02:17:23] Speaker 2: Actually, yeah, he was just mad.

[02:17:24] Speaker 16: Yeah.

[02:17:25] Speaker 9: 'Cause I remember the previous edition at all.

[02:17:27] Speaker 16: That is bad for your stealth roll.

[02:17:27] Speaker 9: So their perception DC is 12.

[02:17:32] Speaker 2: But you don't need much to beat their stealth there.

[02:17:34] Speaker 9: Yeah, so they're not very perceptive.

[02:17:36] Speaker 2: What people do with that is that way you can hide behind something, then you can pop out, shoot-

[02:17:39] Speaker 9: Yes.

[02:17:39] Speaker 2: ... then you get their off-guard to you, and then you get-

[02:17:41] Speaker 16: Kinda why I did this.

[02:17:43] Speaker 2: ... your bonus damage.

[02:17:44] Speaker 17: (coughs)

[02:17:44] Speaker 2: And you might be doing that a lot throughout the campaign, is... So who's up next?

[02:17:48] Speaker 16: Uh, after Wren 3 and 4, it's Arnar.

[02:17:51] Speaker 2: I think Wren 4 is dead.

[02:17:52] Speaker 17: I just think about Lord of the Rings when I hear your name.

[02:17:56] Speaker 9: Good.

[02:17:57] Speaker 16: (laughs) So Wren 4 is dead?

[02:17:59] Speaker 17: The Northern Kingdom.

[02:18:00] Speaker 9: Yep.

[02:18:01] Speaker 16: Okay, so-

[02:18:01] Speaker 2: But three is still alive, so.

[02:18:02] Speaker 17: For now.

[02:18:03] Speaker 18: Okay. Um, I'll target that one.

[02:18:06] Speaker 17: 'Cause she pops back out and summons-

[02:18:08] Speaker 18: With needle darts again.

[02:18:11] Speaker 2: Which one are you targeting, the guy behind the bushes?

[02:18:13] Speaker 18: Yeah.

[02:18:14] Speaker 2: Okay.

[02:18:14] Speaker 18: I can see him, nice and easy. Uh, uh, that would be a 25.

[02:18:20] Speaker 2: That'll hit.

[02:18:23] Speaker 18: Does it crit?

[02:18:25] Speaker 16: That's a strong swing. Yeah.

[02:18:26] Speaker 2: No, but close.

[02:18:32] Speaker 18: Thanks.

[02:18:32] Speaker 2: Oh no, wait, I have the wrong side. No, the, that does.

[02:18:34] Speaker 9: 23. Yeah, t- uh, 23 is a crit.

[02:18:35] Speaker 16: Yeah.

[02:18:36] Speaker 17: Was gonna say, we're hitting it before.

[02:18:37] Speaker 18: Wait, it is a crit?

[02:18:38] Speaker 9: Yep.

[02:18:38] Speaker 2: I had the wrong side of the...

[02:18:39] Speaker 17: We're hitting it on the 13s before, so.

[02:18:41] Speaker 9: Yeah. (die clattering)

[02:18:43] Speaker 18: All right, then I'm gonna annihilate this thing, I imagine.

[02:18:49] Speaker 17: You and your d4 dice 2. Look at-

[02:18:51] Speaker 18: The problem is they seem to keep coming back.

[02:18:53] Speaker 17: (laughs)

[02:18:55] Speaker 9: Colton's an Andy Ford ice. He's, like, addicted to 'em. (laughs)

[02:18:59] Speaker 18: Uh, 18 points of damage.

[02:19:01] Speaker 9: Okay. It's down many small pieces.

[02:19:03] Speaker 17: Yeah, yeah. Until the, she comes back up and raises them back up again.

[02:19:08] Speaker 18: And then, uh...

[02:19:09] Speaker 16: Dodge it. Dodge tape.

[02:19:09] Speaker 9: Maybe I can, maybe I can interfere with that on my next turn.

[02:19:13] Speaker 17: She isn't within range.

[02:19:15] Speaker 9: I'd have to climb one action, move one action. (claps hands) Really difficult.

[02:19:20] Speaker 17: So she's going to throw it to me.

[02:19:21] Speaker 9: Oh, yeah. Oh, you're gonna shoot her.

[02:19:22] Speaker 17: Yeah.

[02:19:27] Speaker 19: Okay. That's my turn.

[02:19:30] Speaker 2: Next up.

[02:19:30] Speaker 20: Upkeep.

[02:19:32] Speaker 2: Okay, then enter in-

[02:19:34] Speaker 21: (laughs)

[02:19:35] Speaker 20: There's Eve.

[02:19:36] Speaker 2: ... red one and two again. There's a new red one and two.

[02:19:38] Speaker 19: New red one and two.

[02:19:40] Speaker 2: They're gonna be on a 20.

[02:19:42] Speaker 21: Mm.

[02:19:44] Speaker 20: They're so pretty.

[02:19:45] Speaker 2: And then red-

[02:19:47] Speaker 20: There we go.

[02:19:48] Speaker 2: ... 11 and 12, who are at a nine. (tense music) Trust me, this was a very annoying scenario to try to balance. (laughs)

[02:20:01] Speaker 19: Yeah.

[02:20:01] Speaker 2: Without as being in the extreme-

[02:20:02] Speaker 22: There's just a lot... It's waves of easy to kill guys.

[02:20:05] Speaker 21: Yeah.

[02:20:06] Speaker 20: Out there-

[02:20:06] Speaker 22: It's still... It's a certain kind of fun.

[02:20:07] Speaker 20: Fear them.

[02:20:08] Speaker 23: It's a matter of how fast can we take the guys out.

[02:20:11] Speaker 20: It's your turn.

[02:20:12] Speaker 23: It's how fast you can take the necromancer out. (laughs) Yeah.

[02:20:14] Speaker 22: (laughs) Because that's what ends the wave.

[02:20:17] Speaker 20: Alberich. You're up.

[02:20:19] Speaker 23: Oh, all right. I'm blasting her. (dice clattering) So she's within range easily of my 60 feet. That is a, uh, 22.

[02:20:30] Speaker 22: That'll hit.

[02:20:32] Speaker 23: That's five points of spear damage.

[02:20:36] Speaker 2: Okay.

[02:20:36] Speaker 23: And going to do... Does she look like a larger type of these creatures or a different type of creature?

[02:20:41] Speaker 2: No, same thing. Maybe a little taller, but...

[02:20:44] Speaker 23: I'm going to try to do, uh, recall knowledge.

[02:20:47] Speaker 2: Uh-huh.

[02:20:49] Speaker 20: Good plan.

[02:20:49] Speaker 23: I don't know what you want, what kind of skill you want on them. Uh, just a sec here. Let me grab my, uh... 'Cause I got a free action, so why not?

[02:20:59] Speaker 20: Hmm. Hmm.

[02:21:01] Speaker 22: What is your spell?

[02:21:02] Speaker 23: Divine lance. Weirdly enough now-

[02:21:05] Speaker 22: Are you consecrated?

[02:21:06] Speaker 23: I am.

[02:21:06] Speaker 22: Doesn't that also do-

[02:21:08] Speaker 23: Depends on the type of creature.

[02:21:09] Speaker 22: ... holy damage? Depending on... We don't know what she is.

[02:21:11] Speaker 23: Right.

[02:21:11] Speaker 22: So you should tell him that maybe there's holy damage also.

[02:21:13] Speaker 2: Yeah.

[02:21:14] Speaker 23: Yes. If, uh, it is divine or if sh-... It would... The holy damage would damage her. I am consecrated. I'm a good fucker.

[02:21:21] Speaker 2: Mm. You're a cleric, so... (laughs)

[02:21:23] Speaker 23: Not all clerics are, are consecrated.

[02:21:25] Speaker 2: Oh, I didn't know they weren't anymore.

[02:21:27] Speaker 23: Yeah.

[02:21:27] Speaker 2: Yeah, she's not specifically, uh, evil or whatever it is she needs to be.

[02:21:32] Speaker 23: Yeah, but not all of them are.

[02:21:33] Speaker 2: Um, yeah.

[02:21:34] Speaker 23: It doesn't always...

[02:21:36] Speaker 2: So, um, you could do this off of society, interestingly enough.

[02:21:40] Speaker 20: Oops. Sorry, whoops.

[02:21:41] Speaker 19: Everything's easy at level one. Society.

[02:21:43] Speaker 20: Yeah.

[02:21:44] Speaker 23: That would be a 14.

[02:21:46] Speaker 2: Okay.

[02:21:47] Speaker 23: (laughs)

[02:21:47] Speaker 20: (laughs)

[02:21:49] Speaker 23: Unless Abe's good at it. (laughs)

[02:21:50] Speaker 2: That number is lower than what was on his dice.

[02:21:52] Speaker 23: But, you know, this is what his column is. But I... I rolled a 14, didn't I?

[02:21:54] Speaker 2: No, you... Oh, I thought it was a 15.

[02:21:56] Speaker 23: Well, it's whatev-... Okay.

[02:21:58] Speaker 2: I don't know what you rolled. I thought that was your dice.

[02:21:59] Speaker 23: I thought I rolled a 15. I thought it was gonna be good.

[02:22:00] Speaker 20: This is why I'm not, like, as worried about doing the untrained-

[02:22:03] Speaker 23: 14.

[02:22:03] Speaker 20: ... skills of level one because-

[02:22:04] Speaker 2: Um, you know, these are, um... They're called skeps.

[02:22:07] Speaker 20: There we go.

[02:22:08] Speaker 2: They're a vaguely relative on the ground levels.

[02:22:09] Speaker 22: If they were trainers they would have gone up by five or six.

[02:22:11] Speaker 2: Um, vicious, monstrous little things, more or less opportunist, kind of cowardly.

[02:22:16] Speaker 20: What did you say?

[02:22:16] Speaker 22: What did you say she was called?

[02:22:17] Speaker 2: Skeps.

[02:22:17] Speaker 22: A skep.

[02:22:18] Speaker 2: Skep?

[02:22:19] Speaker 22: Yeah.

[02:22:20] Speaker 23: Don't let them eat after midnight!

[02:22:21] Speaker 22: (laughs)

[02:22:23] Speaker 2: I mean, and what piece of information do you want to know?

[02:22:26] Speaker 23: Uh...

[02:22:26] Speaker 2: And now, remember, we're doing this kind of a little bit experimental.

[02:22:28] Speaker 22: He wasn't here when you explained it.

[02:22:29] Speaker 2: Oh, okay. So basically I want to make, um, recall knowledge a little bit more useful.

[02:22:33] Speaker 23: Oh, that's good.

[02:22:33] Speaker 2: So if you want to do, like, um-

[02:22:35] Speaker 20: Strengths or weaknesses.

[02:22:36] Speaker 2: ... saves.

[02:22:36] Speaker 22: Well, you could just say-

[02:22:37] Speaker 2: Um-

[02:22:37] Speaker 22: ... offenses and get all, uh, or defenses.

[02:22:40] Speaker 2: Yeah.

[02:22:40] Speaker 22: And you don't have to pick resistances or immunities.

[02:22:42] Speaker 2: Yeah.

[02:22:42] Speaker 22: If you say defenses, he'll just give you both.

[02:22:45] Speaker 23: Uh, I'll go with, uh, defenses, sure.

[02:22:47] Speaker 2: Okay. Um... Does not have any specific, um, special defenses. Nothing she's, uh, immune to or nothing she's resistant to.

[02:23:00] Speaker 23: Okay.

[02:23:02] Speaker 22: No holds barred.

[02:23:03] Speaker 23: No holds barred.

[02:23:05] Speaker 2: Yeah, we're gonna do, like, um... Yeah. Basically, there's, like, defenses, offenses, um, saves. I'll give you the best and their weakest save.

[02:23:12] Speaker 20: What about weaknesses?

[02:23:14] Speaker 2: Weaknesses as in as there-

[02:23:16] Speaker 22: Weaknesses are part of... Weaknesses are part of defenses.

[02:23:18] Speaker 19: Oh, they are? Good.

[02:23:19] Speaker 2: So I'm trying to get them on a board.

[02:23:19] Speaker 22: Oh, no. That would... You know, what about... Yeah.

[02:23:21] Speaker 2: Um, offenses would be more like what their s- kind of attacks are.

[02:23:25] Speaker 22: Well, how do you get weaknesses?

[02:23:27] Speaker 2: Uh, weaknesses would be, um-

[02:23:30] Speaker 22: Vuln- yeah.

[02:23:30] Speaker 2: ... vulnerabilities.

[02:23:31] Speaker 20: Hmm. Okay.

[02:23:32] Speaker 2: Stuff like that. I'll try to get them spelled out.

[02:23:34] Speaker 22: (laughs)

[02:23:34] Speaker 2: So it's, like, just four or five different things you get. You'll always get some fluff about them and then you'll get which piece of information I want that to be.

[02:23:40] Speaker 20: Got it.

[02:23:40] Speaker 2: A little bit more useful so you guys have more of a reason-

[02:23:43] Speaker 20: Got it.

[02:23:43] Speaker 2: ... to do it.

[02:23:44] Speaker 23: He's got it.

[02:23:44] Speaker 22: (laughs)

[02:23:44] Speaker 2: You can also say relative level, which I'll-

[02:23:46] Speaker 20: Uh, Alicia is up after you. She's it.

[02:23:48] Speaker 2: Kind of give you an i-... Maybe just a sense if they're close.

[02:23:51] Speaker 22: A little higher, a lot higher.

[02:23:52] Speaker 2: Yeah.

[02:23:52] Speaker 22: Close.

[02:23:53] Speaker 23: Or lower.

[02:23:54] Speaker 22: Below.

[02:23:54] Speaker 23: Okay.

[02:23:55] Speaker 22: Like, color of mob.

[02:23:57] Speaker 23: Yeah.

[02:23:57] Speaker 22: In, in the olden days. (laughs)

[02:23:59] Speaker 19: (laughs)

[02:23:59] Speaker 2: That's... I think that's a reasonable assessment.

[02:24:00] Speaker 22: In the mo- in, uh, in the old MMOs.

[02:24:02] Speaker 2: I actually think it lets you do that.

[02:24:03] Speaker 20: Wait-

[02:24:03] Speaker 2: No one ever does, but...

[02:24:04] Speaker 20: What is that? What is that? (dice clattering)

[02:24:07] Speaker 22: Like, in the pre-World War games MMOs, the mob-

[02:24:09] Speaker 23: I can't remember. None ever does, but I think it was monsters.

[02:24:11] Speaker 22: ... the mob got, like, a mini map, used to be colored based on their relative levels to you.

[02:24:13] Speaker 23: Skulls.

[02:24:14] Speaker 22: Yes.

[02:24:15] Speaker 20: Oh.

[02:24:15] Speaker 22: So red was, like, way harder than you, even level was... I don't remember what that-

[02:24:20] Speaker 20: Uh, okay.

[02:24:20] Speaker 23: What did you say the height was?

[02:24:22] Speaker 22: Well, it's 30... It's 15 feet from the ground, which is why I climbed down that thing.

[02:24:28] Speaker 23: (sucks teeth) S- so...

[02:24:31] Speaker 20: I know where you're talking about her.

[02:24:32] Speaker 2: Yeah.

[02:24:34] Speaker 23: Um, she's just going to take cover. None of these creatures are alive that she can see.

[02:24:40] Speaker 22: Can she see the thing in the window?

[02:24:42] Speaker 23: No, not within range.

[02:24:44] Speaker 22: Oh, I don't know what she has.

[02:24:45] Speaker 23: Nothing within range, 10 feet.

[02:24:48] Speaker 22: Okay. Oh, she's melee.

[02:24:50] Speaker 23: I don't know if she-

[02:24:50] Speaker 22: I don't know if she-

[02:24:50] Speaker 2: She's kind of melee support.

[02:24:51] Speaker 22: I don't know if she's-

[02:24:51] Speaker 2: She likes being around other things that are in melee and she typically goes to help them out.

[02:24:55] Speaker 22: Okay. Wow.

[02:24:57] Speaker 23: Yeah.

[02:24:57] Speaker 2: She doesn't get a ton of damage in melee, but she-

[02:24:58] Speaker 22: She looks pretty tall.

[02:24:59] Speaker 20: (laughs)

[02:25:00] Speaker 22: Yeah, she is, like, 20 feet tall, so can she, like... (laughs)

[02:25:04] Speaker 23: Seems like she could just touch the roof with her hands.

[02:25:07] Speaker 22: Um, she... I don't think she's con- she's not reaching anything.

[02:25:10] Speaker 23: She's not reaching, no.

[02:25:10] Speaker 22: So, yeah.

[02:25:11] Speaker 2: Yeah, and also by her logic, I mean, especially, like, the Katalo seems to like to be in combat. She'd probably be following close by him.

[02:25:18] Speaker 22: Well, who knows?

[02:25:19] Speaker 2: It's hard to say if the rest of the party likes melee that much, but-

[02:25:21] Speaker 20: Yeah, sure.

[02:25:21] Speaker 2: ... she does.

[02:25:22] Speaker 20: Alicia is-

[02:25:23] Speaker 23: She's... He's got to get up to the roof before she can do anything.

[02:25:27] Speaker 20: Five and six.

[02:25:28] Speaker 23: So she's going to just take cover for now.

[02:25:30] Speaker 2: Okay. Five and six. Two-

[02:25:34] Speaker 24: Just seven and eight.

[02:25:35] Speaker 25: Mm. Five and six are in the gazebo.

[02:25:36] Speaker 2: Um, they're not doing anything. There you go.

[02:25:41] Speaker 25: Okay, next is me.

[02:25:42] Speaker 26: I do have a 10-foot pole.

[02:25:44] Speaker 25: Uh-

[02:25:45] Speaker 26: I can make that fire.

[02:25:45] Speaker 25: ... how far can someone measure the-

[02:25:47] Speaker 26: Right.

[02:25:48] Speaker 9: Torch makes more fire.

[02:25:48] Speaker 25: ... from where I am to behind the big tree?

[02:25:50] Speaker 9: Is this you?

[02:25:51] Speaker 25: Yeah.

[02:25:52] Speaker 2: You wanna hide there? Is that what you're saying?

[02:25:54] Speaker 25: Yeah. I'll try to get-

[02:25:55] Speaker 26: (laughs)

[02:25:55] Speaker 25: ... to the tree to try to hide.

[02:25:58] Speaker 9: Uh, 30 feet. With a difficult turn, you got through the bush.

[02:26:02] Speaker 25: What about if I go around the bush?

[02:26:05] Speaker 9: About 30 feet through the bush.

[02:26:06] Speaker 2: And it's also possible... 'Cause you, you have a ranged weapon or?

[02:26:08] Speaker 25: I do.

[02:26:09] Speaker 2: 'Cause you could pop out from out of the bush. You still have cover. You can shoot and you can move after that if you want.

[02:26:14] Speaker 25: Oh.

[02:26:14] Speaker 2: It might be... Well, if you took... If you walked around since-

[02:26:17] Speaker 26: Possibly. I mean, if you just went this way, doesn't the tree provide... You don't have to stand next to the tree-

[02:26:22] Speaker 25: No.

[02:26:22] Speaker 26: ... to get cover if the tree's in between-

[02:26:23] Speaker 9: Yeah.

[02:26:23] Speaker 26: ... you and the bad guys.

[02:26:25] Speaker 25: Uh, that's true.

[02:26:27] Speaker 2: I assume the tree looks exactly like that.

[02:26:29] Speaker 9: Yeah.

[02:26:29] Speaker 2: And it's got a pretty beefy trunk.

[02:26:30] Speaker 25: Okay.

[02:26:31] Speaker 2: But at this rate, she could shoot and then move into cover.

[02:26:34] Speaker 25: Yeah. Well, I'll pull my crossbow with one action. Uh...

[02:26:40] Speaker 2: Oh, yeah. Have to do that.

[02:26:41] Speaker 25: Either mo- like, move or if I move where I can sh- one.

[02:26:45] Speaker 9: Mm-hmm. You can move.

[02:26:48] Speaker 26: Might as well just shoot the boss then.

[02:26:50] Speaker 25: Oh, she's still up there?

[02:26:51] Speaker 2: Yeah, she's up there. You can see her.

[02:26:52] Speaker 25: Oh, well. Okay.

[02:26:53] Speaker 26: That's good.

[02:26:53] Speaker 2: Um, what's her range on that?

[02:26:54] Speaker 26: What's her range?

[02:26:54] Speaker 2: I think they're 30, aren't they? Or no, they might be longer.

[02:26:58] Speaker 9: Is she right at the edge? I can't tell.

[02:27:00] Speaker 26: She's 60.

[02:27:00] Speaker 9: Yeah, she's, uh...

[02:27:02] Speaker 2: 60.

[02:27:03] Speaker 26: Because I think if it's less than 30, then you have the, uh-

[02:27:05] Speaker 9: You are, uh, 55.

[02:27:05] Speaker 26: ... penalty for shooting.

[02:27:06] Speaker 2: Yep, so you're in range?

[02:27:08] Speaker 9: Uh, yeah. I will shoot her then.

[02:27:10] Speaker 2: And she will be off guard to you.

[02:27:12] Speaker 25: Oh, yes. Okay, great. Yeah. Right there. Hmm. That's good enough.

[02:27:29] Speaker 26: (yawns) Hmm.

[02:27:32] Speaker 25: Okay. I'm almost at 20.

[02:27:33] Speaker 26: Knocked out?

[02:27:33] Speaker 9: Up another dice? No, what's that?

[02:27:35] Speaker 25: I was almost... Well, like, almost land at 20.

[02:27:38] Speaker 9: We already hit... We already got the two-hour mark.

[02:27:41] Speaker 26: Seven.

[02:27:42] Speaker 9: We started at 6:45.

[02:27:43] Speaker 26: It's five to 47 minutes since we started. That's a timer on the recorder. (laughs) Oh. I was thinking on the hour, so.

[02:27:49] Speaker 9: It's, it's on the hour from when record starts.

[02:27:52] Speaker 26: Okay. I was just thinking like, you know, seven, eight, nine, 10.

[02:27:57] Speaker 25: 10 points of free stamina.

[02:27:58] Speaker 26: But we started at 6:45.

[02:27:59] Speaker 9: Okay.

[02:28:00] Speaker 26: So that's like too early for the first-

[02:28:01] Speaker 2: Put a good hit on her?

[02:28:02] Speaker 26: Well, it's on the hour. (laughs)

[02:28:03] Speaker 25: Uh, last action, uh-

[02:28:04] Speaker 26: Would you have done it when you were with them?

[02:28:06] Speaker 25: ... reloading, I tucked it behind and covered.

[02:28:08] Speaker 26: No. Not a guess. (laughs)

[02:28:09] Speaker 25: Okay.

[02:28:09] Speaker 9: (laughs)

[02:28:09] Speaker 26: No, it sounds like that. No, I wouldn't have. (laughs)

[02:28:11] Speaker 2: Yeah, you could do that. Yeah. The two actions.

[02:28:13] Speaker 26: Oh, yeah. I forgot it.

[02:28:13] Speaker 2: One to shoot, one to reload and one to hide again. So for your hide again, you can go ahead and roll your stealth. Natural high.

[02:28:21] Speaker 25: Natural 20.

[02:28:22] Speaker 2: Okay. Think you're really well hidden. Uh, next up.

[02:28:28] Speaker 25: The leader.

[02:28:30] Speaker 2: Um, she is going to cast a spell. And all of a sudden, where your arms are right there, this greasy substance starts-

[02:28:43] Speaker 25: Ah.

[02:28:43] Speaker 2: ... dripping, dripping down on you.

[02:28:45] Speaker 26: Oh. Don't worry, I got a torch. I'll burn it off.

[02:28:48] Speaker 27: (laughs)

[02:28:48] Speaker 2: So do a reflex save just to see if you...

[02:28:53] Speaker 26: I told him there was gonna be some fire damage on this place.

[02:28:56] Speaker 2: 2020.

[02:28:56] Speaker 25: Are you gonna be the pyro-

[02:28:57] Speaker 26: Yeah, you keep your-

[02:28:58] Speaker 25: ... Pyro cleric and party?

[02:28:58] Speaker 2: Your thing, but yeah. It's still torrid, so-

[02:29:01] Speaker 26: Fire's always is a valid option.

[02:29:02] Speaker 2: Greasy stuff is-

[02:29:03] Speaker 25: Okay.

[02:29:03] Speaker 2: ... going down.

[02:29:04] Speaker 26: It's not pyro.

[02:29:05] Speaker 2: And then you hear some footsteps going away from you.

[02:29:07] Speaker 26: Just being pragmatic. Although, I am a pyro at heart.

[02:29:11] Speaker 2: Next up.

[02:29:12] Speaker 26: Not the character.

[02:29:14] Speaker 25: Uh, nine and 10 and one and two.

[02:29:16] Speaker 2: Mm.

[02:29:18] Speaker 25: I too am a pyro in life, so this is fair.

[02:29:23] Speaker 26: That's why I wanted to fire something.

[02:29:25] Speaker 2: I see. Okay, nine... One pops out from the side of the building around here.

[02:29:29] Speaker 25: Takes-

[02:29:29] Speaker 26: Takes a shot at Arnar, which is probably gonna be a two increments.

[02:29:31] Speaker 25: Probably the main reason I took Perdhu's flame onto it.

[02:29:34] Speaker 24: (laughs)

[02:29:34] Speaker 2: Yeah, it's gonna be a two increments and he's gonna move back. So he's, it's a very...

[02:29:40] Speaker 26: That's why I'm 50% of his health.

[02:29:41] Speaker 2: He's gonna miss one.

[02:29:41] Speaker 26: Why my character's at fire bolt.

[02:29:43] Speaker 2: Um.

[02:29:43] Speaker 26: (laughs)

[02:29:44] Speaker 2: Tan, you don't really see anything.

[02:29:45] Speaker 25: Good plan. Good plan.

[02:29:45] Speaker 2: Um, then it was one and two.

[02:29:47] Speaker 25: Yeah.

[02:29:48] Speaker 2: Um, you don't hear anything with them.

[02:29:53] Speaker 25: Poor Tom.

[02:29:56] Speaker 9: Screase or not, I want to climb up. It's a climb action. Do I need to, like, make another reflex save since I'm climbing onto a greasy thing?

[02:30:03] Speaker 2: Yeah, I'd say yeah, just 'cause you're-

[02:30:04] Speaker 9: Makes sense.

[02:30:05] Speaker 2: ... easy.

[02:30:06] Speaker 9: I'm good at reflex routes.

[02:30:08] Speaker 26: Maybe not.

[02:30:09] Speaker 9: That's why I have two zero.

[02:30:10] Speaker 27: (laughs)

[02:30:11] Speaker 26: (laughs)

[02:30:12] Speaker 2: I assume an 11 is not a good one to keep.

[02:30:15] Speaker 26: Right.

[02:30:15] Speaker 25: Probably not.

[02:30:17] Speaker 9: 18.

[02:30:19] Speaker 2: That is enough. This, slick as the grease is, you can-

[02:30:22] Speaker 9: Okay, so I'm a ladder now. And then I want to use action number two to m- move into the window area.

[02:30:28] Speaker 2: Okay. Well, we're seeing

[02:30:29] Speaker 28: Something.

[02:30:29] Speaker 9: You implied she went away, but I assume she's not actually there yet since I heard footsteps.

[02:30:35] Speaker 2: The door is open.

[02:30:41] Speaker 9: Oh, that's good.

[02:30:41] Speaker 2: As is the door behind it.

[02:30:43] Speaker 9: And I don't see her from...

[02:30:46] Speaker 2: Oh, she had a movement. This one here is kind of squares. Let me see.

[02:30:52] Speaker 9: I'm not sure I'm gonna run into the house by myself. Mostly I may just, like, stand here to make sure she doesn't come back and fucking reanimate these things while you guys clean up on the ground. I'm not supposed to talk about strategy.

[02:31:03] Speaker 26: You can yell it.

[02:31:05] Speaker 9: I was just thinking that in my head.

[02:31:06] Speaker 25: After that, after Tim is, uh, seven and eight.

[02:31:10] Speaker 2: See her at the end of the, the doorway there.

[02:31:12] Speaker 9: Oh, if I hadn't said that.

[02:31:14] Speaker 26: Oh, you're taunting now.

[02:31:16] Speaker 9: Now, I-

[02:31:16] Speaker 26: Doing it just on purpose.

[02:31:18] Speaker 9: Now, I am tempted.

[02:31:20] Speaker 26: Taunting him to enter the house on his own into doom. (laughs)

[02:31:25] Speaker 9: Now, I am going to, uh, use my last action to parry and increase my armor class. And then I will, like, yell, "She's run..." To the outside.

[02:31:36] Speaker 25: Seven and eight.

[02:31:39] Speaker 29: And 11 and 12 are next.

[02:31:40] Speaker 30: Seven and eight, um-

[02:31:41] Speaker 29: They're on this side.

[02:31:42] Speaker 30: ... are not doing anything. Ignored.

[02:31:43] Speaker 31: Because there are windows she could see through.

[02:31:46] Speaker 29: 11 and 12.

[02:31:47] Speaker 9: I don't know. Uh, well, if she comes near-

[02:31:48] Speaker 30: Um, same deal.

[02:31:48] Speaker 9: ... the front again, I might do-

[02:31:49] Speaker 30: Yours.

[02:31:49] Speaker 9: ... something about it. I don't know what they're doing.

[02:31:51] Speaker 29: Number three.

[02:31:53] Speaker 9: I just don't-

[02:31:53] Speaker 30: One and number three have a shot on R and R.

[02:31:55] Speaker 9: ... want to run in on that section.

[02:31:56] Speaker 31: Yeah. (laughs) I think I'd die.

[02:31:57] Speaker 30: I'm just gonna continue running.

[02:31:58] Speaker 29: (singing)

[02:31:58] Speaker 30: It is at one range increment though. (dramatic music) That'd be, uh, six I think it was, so going out to a 17.

[02:32:11] Speaker 29: Does 17 hit you?

[02:32:12] Speaker 9: It does.

[02:32:14] Speaker 30: It does for three points of damage. And he continues to run around there. Okay. (dramatic music stops)

[02:32:27] Speaker 29: Uh, and you're up. (dramatic music resumes)

[02:32:35] Speaker 30: Hmm.

[02:32:35] Speaker 29: Upkeep is next.

[02:32:36] Speaker 30: (gasps) There'll be nothing on upkeep dyes turn.

[02:32:41] Speaker 29: Oh.

[02:32:41] Speaker 31: So is that an actual ladder or is that just decoration on the inside of the-

[02:32:44] Speaker 30: What's that?

[02:32:45] Speaker 31: ... the front room?

[02:32:46] Speaker 9: Hm, some built-in ladder. Goes to the attic presumably.

[02:32:53] Speaker 31: I don't know if it was really there or...

[02:32:56] Speaker 9: Everything here is-

[02:32:57] Speaker 29: It's covered.

[02:32:57] Speaker 9: ... really there.

[02:32:58] Speaker 31: Okay.

[02:32:58] Speaker 9: It's canon.

[02:32:59] Speaker 31: All right.

[02:33:00] Speaker 9: Look at those wainscotting.

[02:33:02] Speaker 31: I know.

[02:33:04] Speaker 9: This is an expensive mansion.

[02:33:06] Speaker 32: What is wainscotting again?

[02:33:08] Speaker 9: Like, when the bottom half of a wall is covered by wood?

[02:33:11] Speaker 32: Oh.

[02:33:12] Speaker 31: Then you got the ledge waist high.

[02:33:14] Speaker 32: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[02:33:14] Speaker 30: (yawns) I don't know if I'm getting it right.

[02:33:18] Speaker 31: I'm moving... Oops, sorry.

[02:33:18] Speaker 9: It's called wainscotting, wainscoating?

[02:33:20] Speaker 31: Coating. Let's go sit down. There we go. Uh, I'll move up to there and then shield.

[02:33:26] Speaker 30: Okay. Next up-

[02:33:27] Speaker 31: Very old style.

[02:33:29] Speaker 30: Yeah.

[02:33:29] Speaker 31: Old-fashioned style.

[02:33:30] Speaker 9: Like, most modern houses don't have them. Next.

[02:33:34] Speaker 29: Uh, you said-

[02:33:35] Speaker 30: Upkeep we're skipping, and then next up after that.

[02:33:37] Speaker 29: Aelish.

[02:33:37] Speaker 9: All right.

[02:33:37] Speaker 30: Top of the order, I think it's Aelish.

[02:33:38] Speaker 29: Yep. Aelish and Eilish. Eight, yeah, eight.

[02:33:43] Speaker 31: I am going to pull out a torch.

[02:33:46] Speaker 30: We're here to, like, clean this house up 'cause somebody bought it.

[02:33:49] Speaker 32: (laughs)

[02:33:49] Speaker 31: I am cleaning this house. I'm cleansing it-

[02:33:52] Speaker 30: (laughs)

[02:33:52] Speaker 31: ... of the filth.

[02:33:53] Speaker 30: He did say not damage the house, but you can keep anything inside.

[02:33:56] Speaker 31: I told him that, uh, we will, uh, examine the damage of the burn marks on the building. (laughs) Uh, then he's going to charge towards the door.

[02:34:06] Speaker 29: Oh, you're actually... Did you actually pull out a torch?

[02:34:08] Speaker 31: Yeah.

[02:34:09] Speaker 29: (laughs)

[02:34:10] Speaker 31: Uh, then he'll use his third action to light the torch. And that's, that's it. That's all I can do.

[02:34:20] Speaker 29: What about Aelish?

[02:34:21] Speaker 31: Aelish will follow me to the door since she wants to follow into melee. She will definitely- But she is way too tall. ... she will definitely stop you from burning the house down.

[02:34:28] Speaker 32: (laughs)

[02:34:28] Speaker 31: She's way too tall to get in there. But she's next to me. Uh, she will use her second action... I can't fit her underneath there, to open the door though if it's open the door.

[02:34:41] Speaker 30: Okay. Yep, she can al- interact to open it.

[02:34:43] Speaker 31: Okay. Uh, what do we see inside?

[02:34:45] Speaker 9: It's, like, annoying for us to be on both levels at the same time. Oh, they're separable.

[02:34:48] Speaker 32: (laughs)

[02:34:49] Speaker 31: Yes.

[02:34:50] Speaker 32: Ooh.

[02:34:51] Speaker 9: Here.

[02:34:51] Speaker 32: Oh my gosh. Look at that space staircase.

[02:34:53] Speaker 9: I can put it over here if you want. Door opens up.

[02:34:59] Speaker 31: Oh, so there's actually grids here.

[02:35:01] Speaker 9: Yeah.

[02:35:03] Speaker 31: Um, nothing. Five, 10, 15, 20, 25.

[02:35:07] Speaker 32: Yeah.

[02:35:08] Speaker 31: Aelish is way too tall to put in there.

[02:35:10] Speaker 9: Well-

[02:35:11] Speaker 32: Pretend.

[02:35:11] Speaker 9: Now-

[02:35:11] Speaker 31: She's next to me.

[02:35:12] Speaker 9: She can go in now that there's no roof. I mean, she'll fit. If she... You meant to your left or in, or behind?

[02:35:21] Speaker 31: She's next to me.

[02:35:22] Speaker 9: Hmm, I bet Minnie will fit. That's good. Just squint.

[02:35:33] Speaker 31: That's it. That's end of turn.

[02:35:35] Speaker 9: That's three. Next.

[02:35:36] Speaker 29: Red, five and six.

[02:35:39] Speaker 30: (humming)

[02:35:41] Speaker 31: Where to come in.

[02:35:43] Speaker 30: I don't... I think there might be de- or no, they're in the gazebo, they're not doing anything.

[02:35:47] Speaker 29: Uh, me... Is the leader lady still there? No, she ran away.

[02:35:53] Speaker 30: No.

[02:35:54] Speaker 9: You can see to the back of my head if you... And I probably am not paying attention. I would be off balance to you.

[02:35:59] Speaker 31: So is this, um-

[02:36:00] Speaker 9: Do not shoot me in the head.

[02:36:01] Speaker 31: ... interior of the house, how... what kind of shape or condition is, is it like-

[02:36:05] Speaker 30: I think pretty good.

[02:36:06] Speaker 31: ... dusty? So it's pretty good in, like they haven't totally trashed it or anything like that?

[02:36:10] Speaker 30: Nope.

[02:36:10] Speaker 31: Okay.

[02:36:10] Speaker 30: Still pretty good shape. You don't think the house is gonna burn very easily at all.

[02:36:14] Speaker 31: Okay.

[02:36:14] Speaker 9: Not at all.

[02:36:14] Speaker 31: See, even better.

[02:36:15] Speaker 32: Can I move, um, where the one dead one is, right next to the bush next to the house? Can I move there?

[02:36:22] Speaker 30: How many movements? Yes. How many actions do you want to do, use is the question.

[02:36:26] Speaker 32: Uh, well-

[02:36:27] Speaker 30: It won't be one. It'll be two is my guess.

[02:36:30] Speaker 32: Moving is three.

[02:36:31] Speaker 30: That is, that is one movement.

[02:36:35] Speaker 31: I'm almost just as, almost just as fast going straight through the bushes as it go- it's going around it.

[02:36:40] Speaker 32: Well, then we'll go through the bush, I suppose.

[02:36:43] Speaker 9: But that'll take two movements because the first step was difficult, right? Right?

[02:36:46] Speaker 31: Yeah, but otherwise she's gotta go run, which is just gonna take-

[02:36:48] Speaker 9: Yeah, with two movements you can get pretty much anywhere you wanna be over here.

[02:36:51] Speaker 32: Uh, but-

[02:36:51] Speaker 9: With one movement you can probably get to there. (laughs)

[02:36:53] Speaker 31: Yeah.

[02:36:54] Speaker 32: Now, would it be...

[02:36:57] Speaker 9: You're using two movements?

[02:36:58] Speaker 32: Yeah.

[02:36:59] Speaker 9: Then you can decide where you wanna be. You have more than enough space to be at any part of the bush. (laughs)

[02:37:06] Speaker 31: In the bush.

[02:37:09] Speaker 32: Mm, next, next to the dead guy.

[02:37:17] Speaker 9: On this side? Or do you mean this... Where? Where?

[02:37:22] Speaker 32: Uh, where the first spot is.

[02:37:23] Speaker 29: Fine.

[02:37:24] Speaker 31: How bright is it inside the house?

[02:37:26] Speaker 9: Um, dim.

[02:37:29] Speaker 31: Dark.

[02:37:29] Speaker 9: There's not, like, lights or...

[02:37:31] Speaker 31: Well, I guess the fairy's, like, flying around my head.

[02:37:33] Speaker 30: Yeah, if you want to... She'll-

[02:37:34] Speaker 9: Uh.

[02:37:35] Speaker 31: She gives off... She's basically a lantern.

[02:37:37] Speaker 32: Do I see three from where I'm standing?

[02:37:39] Speaker 31: That's why I got rid of my lights.

[02:37:40] Speaker 30: Three? Where is three?

[02:37:42] Speaker 31: Known.

[02:37:44] Speaker 33: I don't even know where three is.

[02:37:45] Speaker 34: I s-

[02:37:45] Speaker 35: I think this was three.

[02:37:46] Speaker 34: No, it, uh-

[02:37:47] Speaker 2: You guys don't see any ones up front here. All the ones you guys know of are... You hear movement from around the back side of the house, but that's about it.

[02:37:56] Speaker 34: Uh-

[02:37:56] Speaker 35: (laughs)

[02:37:56] Speaker 2: I think everyone around the front is dead.

[02:37:58] Speaker 33: There's no three visible on this side of the house?

[02:38:00] Speaker 34: No, he's a-

[02:38:02] Speaker 35: I-

[02:38:03] Speaker 34: I can't ready-

[02:38:04] Speaker 35: Like the sound.

[02:38:05] Speaker 34: ... my third action, can I?

[02:38:06] Speaker 2: I think no.

[02:38:06] Speaker 9: It takes two actions. Yeah. It's ready. It's ready.

[02:38:08] Speaker 34: Okay.

[02:38:08] Speaker 33: It's called a sp-

[02:38:09] Speaker 9: It's one action more than whatever it would normally cost.

[02:38:10] Speaker 34: Yeah. Uh, uh-

[02:38:12] Speaker 33: You can hide.

[02:38:14] Speaker 34: Uh, yeah.

[02:38:18] Speaker 2: Okay. Who's up after you?

[02:38:21] Speaker 34: Uh, the leader lady.

[02:38:23] Speaker 2: Oh. Her... You just see and hear another door opening.

[02:38:29] Speaker 9: Let's see. Think of where it'd be, back here somewhere. Which way does it open?

[02:38:35] Speaker 2: I think it opens inward. You have to be kind of careful with those, but, uh-

[02:38:38] Speaker 9: Yeah.

[02:38:38] Speaker 2: ... worse comes to worst.

[02:38:40] Speaker 9: Right, it's open. It's enough. It's open enough. I'll know that I can walk through it.

[02:38:43] Speaker 34: Yeah.

[02:38:45] Speaker 2: Um, then you hear some yelping on the, um, coming from the back side of the house.

[02:38:49] Speaker 35: It almost reminds me of Ravenloft.

[02:38:52] Speaker 2: Followed by a scrunching sound.

[02:38:56] Speaker 35: Where's the scrunching sound?

[02:38:56] Speaker 9: What does a scrunching sound sound like?

[02:38:58] Speaker 2: Someone landing in a bush.

[02:38:59] Speaker 9: Okay.

[02:39:00] Speaker 35: (laughs)

[02:39:02] Speaker 2: So basically, we don't see it, but basically-

[02:39:04] Speaker 9: It's probably gone.

[02:39:05] Speaker 2: She went like that.

[02:39:09] Speaker 9: Cowards.

[02:39:12] Speaker 33: This is, uh... That printer or that printer?

[02:39:16] Speaker 2: Mm, that one. Be way too expensive to do.

[02:39:18] Speaker 33: Yeah.

[02:39:18] Speaker 2: And that one's not. It'd take forever to do that on that one. Well-

[02:39:23] Speaker 33: What material?

[02:39:24] Speaker 2: This is just PLA standard.

[02:39:25] Speaker 33: Nice.

[02:39:27] Speaker 34: Nine and 10, you're up next.

[02:39:28] Speaker 9: Paintable PLA?

[02:39:28] Speaker 35: Hmm?

[02:39:29] Speaker 9: You can paint PLA?

[02:39:30] Speaker 2: Yeah, you just have to prime it.

[02:39:32] Speaker 9: Guess so.

[02:39:34] Speaker 34: Nine and 10.

[02:39:35] Speaker 35: Looks cool.

[02:39:36] Speaker 2: Um-

[02:39:37] Speaker 34: And one and two.

[02:39:39] Speaker 2: Nine and 10 stay here. They got... You wouldn't be hidden 'cause the, um-

[02:39:55] Speaker 34: I didn't.

[02:39:55] Speaker 2: There's no cover in between you.

[02:39:56] Speaker 34: I didn't hide, no. Not this time.

[02:39:58] Speaker 2: Well, you could've... I think you had one action left, you could've. But from here, they can see you.

[02:40:01] Speaker 34: No.

[02:40:01] Speaker 2: There's no cover in between you and them. He'd have a shot at you, which would be long range, nine is gonna be the same thing.

[02:40:06] Speaker 9: (laughs)

[02:40:06] Speaker 34: Probably, yeah, well, I didn't say-

[02:40:09] Speaker 2: He's gonna come out with his buddy-

[02:40:10] Speaker 34: I didn't say I was gonna hide, so, um, too late.

[02:40:12] Speaker 2: It wouldn't matter in this case because there's no cover between you and them.

[02:40:17] Speaker 34: Yeah.

[02:40:17] Speaker 2: Um, if you were on the other side of the bush, then yes, but they're... They, they see you by a bush, but they have a clean line of sight to you, so-

[02:40:23] Speaker 34: Yeah.

[02:40:24] Speaker 2: Um, so they have two shots coming your way, but these are at range increments. Um, first would be a, 21 minus four would be a 17.

[02:40:32] Speaker 34: Than it is my AC.

[02:40:34] Speaker 2: Um, so that'd be three points. And the other one, um, that'd be, is it 22? This would be an 18, which would just be one point of damage. But, that was... Yeah, they had to move twice to get there. Long as you... So, they done.

[02:40:55] Speaker 34: Uh, one and two on this.

[02:40:57] Speaker 2: One and two are the new guys. You guys don't... Um, yep, you don't see anything.

[02:41:08] Speaker 34: Kog-tal. Then seven and eight are up after.

[02:41:15] Speaker 9: Puts me in that doorway and then there's... Oh, I guess there's a grate.

[02:41:18] Speaker 2: You can kinda see squares in there, you could-

[02:41:20] Speaker 9: One, two, three, four, five. One, two, three, four. Second move-

[02:41:25] Speaker 2: When you get to the-

[02:41:25] Speaker 9: ... I'm back on the balcony.

[02:41:27] Speaker 2: When you get to the balcony, you notice something.

[02:41:31] Speaker 34: Oh, if he can get the mini out.

[02:41:33] Speaker 35: It was really an ogre climbing up out of the bush. (dramatic music)

[02:41:38] Speaker 9: Ah.

[02:41:39] Speaker 35: (laughs) He gets you stuck?

[02:41:41] Speaker 9: It's a puzzle game. There. Oh, I dropped him. I almost had him out. It's the, the operation game.

[02:41:49] Speaker 2: So you see-

[02:41:50] Speaker 9: I had one more square left.

[02:41:51] Speaker 2: ... two little guys-

[02:41:52] Speaker 9: Okay.

[02:41:53] Speaker 2: ... that were hiding out from the balcony.

[02:41:54] Speaker 9: Brilliant.

[02:41:55] Speaker 2: With readied actions.

[02:41:56] Speaker 35: (laughs)

[02:41:56] Speaker 9: Uh-oh.

[02:41:57] Speaker 2: The other guy is up there, but he's kinda... That was where one and two were. I'm just gonna put 'em on top of each other.

[02:42:04] Speaker 9: I probably would've seen them, but I still would've gone there 'cause they are targets.

[02:42:07] Speaker 2: They were kind of around the side though.

[02:42:08] Speaker 9: That's fine, but I said I would've like, "Oh, great." I would've continued towards them.

[02:42:12] Speaker 2: (laughs) Um, well, one gets a crit.

[02:42:15] Speaker 9: Uh-oh.

[02:42:16] Speaker 2: Four, four points of damage. Those guys have to actually... Um, so six, that'd be a s- 18.

[02:42:27] Speaker 9: Nope, 19.

[02:42:28] Speaker 2: Would miss. So yep, you got two little guys and an extra-

[02:42:31] Speaker 9: I have one action left. Guess what?

[02:42:33] Speaker 2: (laughs)

[02:42:34] Speaker 9: Flurry of blows. I will do the, the awkward ones to get it out of the way first in case it dies.

[02:42:41] Speaker 2: One, number one.

[02:42:43] Speaker 9: One. Basting.

[02:42:43] Speaker 35: That's not gonna do it.

[02:42:45] Speaker 2: You don't need a lot.

[02:42:47] Speaker 9: I just need to hit.

[02:42:48] Speaker 2: Oh.

[02:42:49] Speaker 9: That is, uh-

[02:42:50] Speaker 35: He rolled a two.

[02:42:50] Speaker 9: ... 13.

[02:42:52] Speaker 2: Um, 13 will.

[02:42:53] Speaker 9: Yeah. That is six. Six bludgeoning.

[02:42:57] Speaker 2: You want, you moved him right off the... You hear a scrunching sound as he flies off and then lands on that porch.

[02:43:04] Speaker 35: (laughs)

[02:43:05] Speaker 2: You just go all batter, batter on him.

[02:43:08] Speaker 9: Okay. (laughs) That's my turn.

[02:43:11] Speaker 34: Yeah, red, seven and eight are next and then 11 and 12.

[02:43:17] Speaker 2: Seven basically is gonna double move to there. Eight is gonna start making its way around to there. You guys might see some stuff happening on the side there. Um, who is up next?

[02:43:29] Speaker 34: 11 and 12.

[02:43:31] Speaker 35: Are they being stealthy?

[02:43:32] Speaker 2: No, they were just moving into cover. They didn't have enough time to try and escape.

[02:43:35] Speaker 34: Oh.

[02:43:35] Speaker 9: You probably would've noticed mo-

[02:43:37] Speaker 2: Yeah, you would've.

[02:43:37] Speaker 34: After 11 and 12, it's pretty-

[02:43:39] Speaker 9: Well, whoever's in the back might've noticed-

[02:43:40] Speaker 2: Three's dead or no, three's alive.

[02:43:42] Speaker 9: Well, you might still see 'em. The porch is open.

[02:43:43] Speaker 34: And there's 10s on them.

[02:43:45] Speaker 35: That's why-

[02:43:46] Speaker 2: You see three from where you are at, moving down below. He sees, basically he's coming to see her in the bush. He sees you. He'll take a shot with his-

[02:43:55] Speaker 36: I assume you're gonna cover?

[02:43:56] Speaker 2: Yeah, you're gonna have to cover.

[02:43:57] Speaker 36: Lessor or standard?

[02:43:58] Speaker 2: I'm gonna go standard because-

[02:43:59] Speaker 36: Okay.

[02:43:59] Speaker 2: ... he's shooting at an angle and then-

[02:44:00] Speaker 36: Maybe, uh, 21. (dice clattering)

[02:44:02] Speaker 31: Oh, no way.

[02:44:03] Speaker 2: Um, that's a 22.

[02:44:04] Speaker 36: That's it.

[02:44:05] Speaker 2: For one point.

[02:44:06] Speaker 36: I've... You've almost exhausted my stamina.

[02:44:09] Speaker 2: They only do D3 damage, which is-

[02:44:11] Speaker 36: I know.

[02:44:11] Speaker 2: ... why some of them have a hard time hitting. But, I was worried with so many of them that-

[02:44:14] Speaker 36: Yeah. It's fine. Go ahead.

[02:44:15] Speaker 2: ... you get overwhelmed pretty easily, so. Uh, yep. Next up.

[02:44:19] Speaker 37: Arnar.

[02:44:20] Speaker 2: Arnar.

[02:44:21] Speaker 37: And then upkeep is after.

[02:44:25] Speaker 36: You saw movement off to your left.

[02:44:26] Speaker 31: Yeah.

[02:44:28] Speaker 36: They're, they're behind cover now but you definitely saw them run up.

[02:44:30] Speaker 31: Oh, yeah, that guy.

[02:44:31] Speaker 36: There's two of them. There's another one there, you probably saw back there.

[02:44:34] Speaker 31: Oh, yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm. Where's, uh... Here, oh, there you go.

[02:44:39] Speaker 36: Oh, thank you. (coughs) I mean, the big bush is probably in the way.

[02:44:46] Speaker 31: Yeah.

[02:44:47] Speaker 36: Yep.

[02:44:48] Speaker 31: And the small bush. I think no matter what you're gonna do, they're gonna have cover on you.

[02:44:57] Speaker 36: Well, lesser cover though, only lesser cover. If you get to the middle of the pathway, you'll be able to see most of it.

[02:45:04] Speaker 38: Uh, yeah, um-

[02:45:05] Speaker 36: They're... Technically, lightning bolt.

[02:45:08] Speaker 31: (laughs)

[02:45:09] Speaker 36: They're in a straight line. (laughs)

[02:45:11] Speaker 38: Well, I don't have a lightning bolt. So-

[02:45:13] Speaker 36: Not quite yet?

[02:45:14] Speaker 38: No. Um, but we'll go with needle darts again.

[02:45:19] Speaker 31: Well, lightning bolt always sounds like a better spell than it actually is 'cause I don't think they'd actually be able to get to, like, hit multiple targets with it, but...

[02:45:25] Speaker 36: It's crap. It's crap.

[02:45:26] Speaker 31: Yeah.

[02:45:26] Speaker 37: You... None of you...

[02:45:27] Speaker 31: What I watch is like World of Warcraft strong, chain lightning.

[02:45:30] Speaker 37: ... had an opportunity to use Thief on the die? Yes?

[02:45:31] Speaker 38: 16.

[02:45:32] Speaker 2: 16 hit?

[02:45:32] Speaker 31: The only lightning is different, totally. But yeah.

[02:45:35] Speaker 2: Even with cover they're still gonna hit.

[02:45:39] Speaker 31: But if you give it too much damage on single targets then it's overpowered when you hit multiple ones.

[02:45:43] Speaker 2: 10 will kill him.

[02:45:44] Speaker 31: And if you don't, well then it's like...

[02:45:46] Speaker 38: Boom.

[02:45:46] Speaker 31: Yeah.

[02:45:47] Speaker 38: (laughs) I really like this cantrip. This is a lo- it's a fun one.

[02:45:52] Speaker 37: I'm back.

[02:45:53] Speaker 31: Heal darts?

[02:45:53] Speaker 38: Yeah.

[02:45:53] Speaker 36: Heal darts are good, because it's scale as well as magic missile does and it's more powerful at level one than it will be at level 5.

[02:46:01] Speaker 2: Though I mean, it's a cantrip which is lovely.

[02:46:03] Speaker 36: So, upkeep.

[02:46:04] Speaker 2: Upkeep, um, nothing happens, so it goes.

[02:46:07] Speaker 37: All right and Ailish then?

[02:46:08] Speaker 36: Um, well, I don't know that I saw anybody else that's alive so... Uh, I go charging in. I'm coming!

[02:46:18] Speaker 37: With the lit torch and...

[02:46:19] Speaker 31: Oh, I see what you're doing, 10, 15... Well, yeah, I saw you go upstairs, so I went upstairs.

[02:46:22] Speaker 37: You run in the house with the lit torch. What could go wrong?

[02:46:26] Speaker 31: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25.

[02:46:29] Speaker 36: Stairs.

[02:46:30] Speaker 31: 30, so that's one. Where are you? 5, 10, 15.

[02:46:35] Speaker 36: I'm back. No, he doesn't have that accent.

[02:46:38] Speaker 31: (laughs) Oh, come on. 20.

[02:46:40] Speaker 36: I am called Kotal.

[02:46:41] Speaker 31: 25. Wait, am I 25 or 30? I have to check.

[02:46:47] Speaker 36: You're probably 25.

[02:46:48] Speaker 31: Too far, yeah.

[02:46:49] Speaker 36: Unless you're an Elf.

[02:46:51] Speaker 31: Yeah, okay. So it would be my third turn then.

[02:46:54] Speaker 36: Yeah, all right.

[02:46:55] Speaker 31: Okay, so that'd be 5, 10, 15, 20.

[02:47:02] Speaker 36: You're in the doorway?

[02:47:03] Speaker 31: 25.

[02:47:04] Speaker 38: I, I'll be just to the door.

[02:47:06] Speaker 36: Okay. Right behind me?

[02:47:07] Speaker 38: Yep.

[02:47:08] Speaker 2: Yeah, you can put that one top the door if you want to, we'll just remember that's where you're at.

[02:47:11] Speaker 38: This one right underneath. 'Cause-

[02:47:15] Speaker 2: All those things, the door jams basically come out, but then they're a pain to get back in.

[02:47:18] Speaker 38: Oh. 'Cause she is gonna be right behind.

[02:47:21] Speaker 2: She has a 35. She could make it all the way in there.

[02:47:23] Speaker 36: Yeah, there's no place for her to stand.

[02:47:25] Speaker 2: Well-

[02:47:25] Speaker 36: I guess she could stand like on the balcony.

[02:47:27] Speaker 2: She could stand next to them.

[02:47:29] Speaker 37: Yeah. She will stand right next to you.

[02:47:31] Speaker 2: And bear in mind she does have-

[02:47:33] Speaker 36: She's in that spot.

[02:47:34] Speaker 38: Yeah.

[02:47:35] Speaker 2: W- Um, how much did they take, three? Yeah, they would've taken a three.

[02:47:37] Speaker 36: Yeah, probably three for both.

[02:47:40] Speaker 38: Yep. Okay.

[02:47:42] Speaker 2: Next.

[02:47:42] Speaker 37: Five and six.

[02:47:44] Speaker 31: I have your back. I don't know what your accent is.

[02:47:46] Speaker 2: Your five and six are in there. Um, they're not doing anything.

[02:47:52] Speaker 31: So, now that I'm up top, I can actually see what's in the back so I might try to-

[02:47:57] Speaker 2: Oh, wait. Five and six might do something.

[02:47:58] Speaker 31: So she's prone in the bush?

[02:48:00] Speaker 2: Um, technically. You'd have to look over the edge to see that.

[02:48:02] Speaker 36: You're too far from the edge, Pelly, to see straight down.

[02:48:04] Speaker 2: Um, these guys are gonna move out and move back and they're gonna take their shots-

[02:48:09] Speaker 31: I was about to ask before because I couldn't see.

[02:48:09] Speaker 2: ... oh, yeah, because they'd be shooting up to there. So yeah, they're gonna come out where they're just within one range increment and they're gonna... Well no, I don't think they can get to within one range and back. They'd have to move out to there and back. So, it's gonna be a move, a two range increment shot and a move back basically.

[02:48:27] Speaker 31: (coughs)

[02:48:30] Speaker 2: Aelish and I are the ones in the front? Um, they'll take one shot at both of you for the heck of it. So it'd be, they'd need a phenomenally high roll. That would be a...

[02:48:40] Speaker 36: You need a 19, assuming I don't have cover.

[02:48:42] Speaker 2: ... 19 within, they're gonna have cover and they're gonna have range increments so that's not gonna do it. The other one, um, that's an 11. So that'd be, uh, 17 minus a bunch of stuff they're gonna miss and back under the-

[02:48:54] Speaker 31: Do you look very bloody?

[02:48:55] Speaker 2: No.

[02:48:56] Speaker 31: Okay.

[02:48:57] Speaker 37: It's 5 and 6?

[02:48:57] Speaker 36: Out of breath?

[02:48:58] Speaker 31: Yep.

[02:48:58] Speaker 36: Okay.

[02:48:59] Speaker 38: My stamina's almost gone.

[02:49:00] Speaker 37: Okay, I'm up next.

[02:49:00] Speaker 31: I am out of breath.

[02:49:01] Speaker 36: Uh, I have no wounds.

[02:49:03] Speaker 37: Can I...

[02:49:03] Speaker 36: That can be healed.

[02:49:05] Speaker 31: I'm just an old man.

[02:49:05] Speaker 37: Move behind the bush there.

[02:49:07] Speaker 2: Right here?

[02:49:08] Speaker 37: And try to hide.

[02:49:09] Speaker 2: Yep.

[02:49:11] Speaker 37: As... Well, move and hide, I guess.

[02:49:14] Speaker 2: Move and hide would be two actions.

[02:49:15] Speaker 36: Two actions, yeah.

[02:49:16] Speaker 2: You could, um, shoot, move.

[02:49:19] Speaker 36: Shoot, move, hide? You just won't hit.

[02:49:21] Speaker 2: Yeah.

[02:49:22] Speaker 37: Yeah.

[02:49:22] Speaker 2: Then you got three back 'cause if you were standing right there-

[02:49:24] Speaker 37: All right, have 9 or 10, have either one of them, them, them been hit yet?

[02:49:29] Speaker 2: No.

[02:49:29] Speaker 36: Um-

[02:49:29] Speaker 2: You guys are pretty much made for ranged shots.

[02:49:31] Speaker 37: Oh, oh. Shoot number 10.

[02:49:32] Speaker 2: So, you have plenty of range as they're coming.

[02:49:34] Speaker 36: They mostly don't die on a, unless... Or they mostly don't survive when they get hit.

[02:49:40] Speaker 37: Well, I will, I will shoot number 10. 19.

[02:49:46] Speaker 2: That'll hit.

[02:49:49] Speaker 39: Six.

[02:49:50] Speaker 2: That kills him.

[02:49:50] Speaker 39: Six.

[02:49:51] Speaker 2: Yeah, kills him.

[02:49:52] Speaker 39: And then I'm gonna, uh, move around the bush and hide.

[02:49:54] Speaker 40: Hide?

[02:49:55] Speaker 39: Yeah.

[02:49:55] Speaker 2: Okay. You can roll for a hide check if you want to. (dice clattering)

[02:49:59] Speaker 39: Oh, that's not great. 12.

[02:50:02] Speaker 2: Yeah, you'd think you'd throw it in for these things. (laughs)

[02:50:05] Speaker 9: I know what their perception is.

[02:50:06] Speaker 39: Okay. Uh, next is the leader.

[02:50:07] Speaker 9: Two? (laughs)

[02:50:08] Speaker 2: The leader? Um, leader will roll out of the bushes and stand up for one action. Um...

[02:50:17] Speaker 9: There's a dead kid right there.

[02:50:19] Speaker 2: (laughs) She is going to... Let me see actually where's her... Yep, she's gonna grab Neshu. And this thing is gonna roll off the bush. Was gonna basically, yeah, roll off the bush and grab his, uh, take out the weapon he would have had before he got swelled, smacked off of the balcony.

[02:50:43] Speaker 41: Awesome.

[02:50:43] Speaker 40: And then he falls and takes fall damage and dies again.

[02:50:46] Speaker 41: (laughs)

[02:50:46] Speaker 39: (laughs)

[02:50:46] Speaker 2: So, he's coming back as-

[02:50:48] Speaker 9: You don't take fall damage unless you fall more than 10 feet.

[02:50:51] Speaker 2: I'm trying to put him as a blue because he's gonna have-

[02:50:53] Speaker 40: Technically, technically he's on the second acre, so that'd be 10 feet.

[02:50:55] Speaker 2: So that's it for her.

[02:50:56] Speaker 40: And then he falls.

[02:50:56] Speaker 39: Uh, nine and 10.

[02:50:58] Speaker 40: (laughs) 'Cause of the height of the bush.

[02:50:59] Speaker 39: And one and two.

[02:51:02] Speaker 2: I think... Oh, one and two.

[02:51:04] Speaker 9: One is next to me.

[02:51:06] Speaker 39: Well, nine and 10.

[02:51:06] Speaker 2: Really?

[02:51:06] Speaker 9: One, one or two is next to me.

[02:51:08] Speaker 2: Yeah, and the other one died.

[02:51:09] Speaker 40: Two.

[02:51:09] Speaker 9: Two.

[02:51:10] Speaker 39: Nine and 10.

[02:51:11] Speaker 2: He has three targets. Um, one, two and Ailish is three. Three, Ailish. (dice clattering)

[02:51:19] Speaker 40: What is her armor class?

[02:51:20] Speaker 2: That's only a 12. That'll- that's-

[02:51:21] Speaker 40: That's good.

[02:51:21] Speaker 2: She has a huge armor class.

[02:51:24] Speaker 40: 18.

[02:51:24] Speaker 9: Almost as good as mine.

[02:51:26] Speaker 40: Almost as good as mine.

[02:51:28] Speaker 2: She's also got kind of a defensive gear.

[02:51:29] Speaker 9: Kotal is, uh-

[02:51:30] Speaker 2: Who's next?

[02:51:31] Speaker 9: ... dextrous, hard, or AC-

[02:51:33] Speaker 2: Oh, no. It was this one.

[02:51:33] Speaker 9: Now, if it's nine and 10 and then one and two.

[02:51:35] Speaker 40: Martial arts. Oh, pretty much 10 there.

[02:51:36] Speaker 9: Those four-

[02:51:37] Speaker 2: Not me.

[02:51:37] Speaker 9: ... and crafter and researcher.

[02:51:40] Speaker 39: Right now.

[02:51:40] Speaker 9: And he's got a bunch of non-combat.

[02:51:41] Speaker 2: Okay, one, two, three-

[02:51:42] Speaker 40: I was just realizing I should've taken crafting for my skills.

[02:51:46] Speaker 2: And then nine and 10 you killed 10 so he would-

[02:51:48] Speaker 9: I don't- I'm not ever gonna become, like, a hardcore crafter.

[02:51:51] Speaker 39: 10 I did kill.

[02:51:51] Speaker 9: True.

[02:51:52] Speaker 39: Okay, so-

[02:51:52] Speaker 2: Um-

[02:51:52] Speaker 40: Well, Jack Brown, he's an inventor.

[02:51:54] Speaker 9: Yeah.

[02:51:54] Speaker 2: He's going to-

[02:51:55] Speaker 40: I do have engineering.

[02:51:56] Speaker 9: He's more of like, uh-

[02:51:57] Speaker 2: He can't see you.

[02:51:58] Speaker 9: ... is what Kotal's gonna be like.

[02:51:59] Speaker 2: He saw you disappear behind a tree.

[02:52:01] Speaker 39: Mm-hmm.

[02:52:01] Speaker 9: Or find shit in the woods and...

[02:52:04] Speaker 2: He's gonna run behind cover and peak around the tree to y'all.

[02:52:07] Speaker 40: I did that.

[02:52:08] Speaker 9: And engineering, so-

[02:52:08] Speaker 2: A few of his actions, he's peaking around the corner trying to see what's going on.

[02:52:13] Speaker 9: I'm gonna do like ranging.

[02:52:13] Speaker 2: He probably sees Arnor.

[02:52:15] Speaker 40: I'm not really good, I mean, but it's just character personality.

[02:52:16] Speaker 2: Actually, yeah, when he gets to here, if we go here, he can see Arnor at a very long shot. So two range instruments shot at Arnor.

[02:52:24] Speaker 9: It hasn't stopped him yet.

[02:52:26] Speaker 40: Yup.

[02:52:26] Speaker 2: He pretty much needs a higher number.

[02:52:28] Speaker 40: That was a 20.

[02:52:29] Speaker 2: 18 minus four would only be a 14.

[02:52:32] Speaker 9: (laughs)

[02:52:32] Speaker 39: Does 14 hit you Matt?

[02:52:33] Speaker 9: Uh-uh. Better that or we're having a conversation about armor class. (laughs)

[02:52:37] Speaker 2: Uh, no. Uh, yeah, to hear a... You hear a shot whistling by, but it's misses by a good mile. Next up.

[02:52:42] Speaker 9: Next.

[02:52:44] Speaker 39: Kotal.

[02:52:45] Speaker 9: Oh, I'm gonna punch the guy right in front of me. Regular, not flurry. (dice clattering) He's got a 16. Hit for enough. 10, 10.

[02:52:57] Speaker 2: Wow. You wanna knock him off the bush, building?

[02:52:59] Speaker 9: Yeah. This is a-

[02:53:00] Speaker 39: I'm really fast.

[02:53:01] Speaker 9: So, like, this is kinda like baseball. So, he went whoosh.

[02:53:03] Speaker 40: Uh, do you really want to knock him off where she can heal him again?

[02:53:06] Speaker 9: I don't... Do I get a choice?

[02:53:07] Speaker 2: Well, you can choose what you want to if you want to, thematically. Otherwise you can make an offer.

[02:53:11] Speaker 9: Well, and I just saw her recurrent, con at one right now. I just want to sc- come down from the top and knock him-

[02:53:15] Speaker 2: Oh.

[02:53:16] Speaker 9: ... flat on the mountain.

[02:53:16] Speaker 2: If you want to, you can keep him on there.

[02:53:17] Speaker 9: Yeah. Just because I just saw her bring the one I left when it came back.

[02:53:21] Speaker 2: (laughs)

[02:53:21] Speaker 9: And I want to-

[02:53:23] Speaker 39: Not-

[02:53:23] Speaker 2: And since they're-

[02:53:24] Speaker 9: I'm on the edge.

[02:53:24] Speaker 2: ... standing there.

[02:53:25] Speaker 9: I want to jump down.

[02:53:27] Speaker 2: You can go thunk in the bush if you want to.

[02:53:29] Speaker 9: I have quick jump.

[02:53:30] Speaker 2: Oh. Well, jumping down doesn't elevate you need a quick jump.

[02:53:33] Speaker 9: Just lets me... No, but, you know.

[02:53:35] Speaker 2: You can just bounce and stop there.

[02:53:35] Speaker 9: I don't need to... I can jump further without taking a stride.

[02:53:39] Speaker 39: Uh, one fell off.

[02:53:39] Speaker 40: Oh, yeah.

[02:53:40] Speaker 9: Uh, is it acrobatics to not land on my ass, or what?

[02:53:43] Speaker 2: From there, I don't... If you land in the bush, um, it's just gonna be difficult terrain for your landing.

[02:53:48] Speaker 9: Okay.

[02:53:48] Speaker 2: But I'm not gonna do anything special with it.

[02:53:51] Speaker 9: But I'm-

[02:53:51] Speaker 2: It'll cushion your blow.

[02:53:52] Speaker 9: Standing or laying on the ground? Do I need to stand up?

[02:53:55] Speaker 2: I'm doing acrobatics just to see if you-

[02:53:57] Speaker 9: I don't want to be flying flat if I can acrobatics my way onto my feet.

[02:54:01] Speaker 2: And actually, do you... Oh, you probably don't have it.

[02:54:03] Speaker 9: 10.

[02:54:05] Speaker 2: Yeah, with a 10 you're gonna have a hard time 'cause you're landing in the bush too much. It's not exactly-

[02:54:08] Speaker 9: Okay. I'm in the bush. I'll use my last action to get out of the bush and stand up.

[02:54:12] Speaker 2: Yeah. Stand. Yeah, you can just roll out, roll out of it-

[02:54:13] Speaker 9: Yeah.

[02:54:13] Speaker 2: ... and stand there. So you wanna be... You can put yourself where you want to, uh, Jason, as she rolls through.

[02:54:17] Speaker 9: I know, actually.

[02:54:18] Speaker 2: Yep.

[02:54:18] Speaker 9: It's right next to her. I wanna be in her face so that she is intimidated by it.

[02:54:26] Speaker 2: Okay, next step.

[02:54:27] Speaker 9: And I will, like, say, "I probably have tackle opportunity, do you think?"

[02:54:32] Speaker 39: (laughs)

[02:54:33] Speaker 9: "Do you think I have a tackle opportunity? Do you know when, what level monks get that yet? Or do you... You wanna, you wanna gamble?" Spoiler, they never have it at level one. (laughs)

[02:54:43] Speaker 40: (laughs) Ah, spoiler, not many do.

[02:54:45] Speaker 9: Fighters.

[02:54:46] Speaker 39: Is that your turn?

[02:54:47] Speaker 9: Yeah.

[02:54:48] Speaker 39: Uh, seven and then 11 and 12 are next.

[02:54:51] Speaker 2: 7 and 12.

[02:54:52] Speaker 40: 7's on this side.

[02:54:54] Speaker 2: Um, would've seen... Oh, he does see. He'll take a shot at... I think he's just gonna move.

[02:55:05] Speaker 9: He can see the shadow.

[02:55:06] Speaker 40: I don't know that he'd see him, but I think he could see-

[02:55:08] Speaker 2: Yeah. Well, I'm gonna take a shot at... Yeah.

[02:55:11] Speaker 39: Hotshot.

[02:55:12] Speaker 2: Does he also s-

[02:55:12] Speaker 9: He could probably hear the business going on back here.

[02:55:14] Speaker 2: He saw this guy get killed for sure. He's gonna-

[02:55:15] Speaker 40: Oh, yeah. He would've saw you jump off.

[02:55:17] Speaker 2: Yeah, he doesn't, um... He's going to basically try to get a shot off on her.

[02:55:21] Speaker 40: Oh, Ailish?

[02:55:22] Speaker 2: Yeah.

[02:55:22] Speaker 40: Okay.

[02:55:22] Speaker 2: 'Cause that's the one he could easily see from where he was at. Um, that's gonna be, uh-

[02:55:27] Speaker 40: But she's so tall.

[02:55:27] Speaker 2: ... 26 to hit.

[02:55:28] Speaker 40: (laughs) Not a crit, but a hit.

[02:55:30] Speaker 2: So three points for her.

[02:55:32] Speaker 40: Okay.

[02:55:33] Speaker 2: And that's it for him.

[02:55:34] Speaker 40: Okay.

[02:55:34] Speaker 2: He had two actions to get there.

[02:55:35] Speaker 39: 11 and 12.

[02:55:36] Speaker 2: 12 and 12. You don't hear anything from them.

[02:55:44] Speaker 39: Three.

[02:55:46] Speaker 2: Um, three is going to walk around to the other side of Kotal and he's gonna take a flanking shot.

[02:55:51] Speaker 9: Mm-hmm, are you really though?

[02:55:54] Speaker 42: Apparently.

[02:55:55] Speaker 43: I am unflankable. I have that feat.

[02:55:57] Speaker 2: He gets a crit, which doubles as two to a four.

[02:56:01] Speaker 42: Ouch. That would be, uh, yes. He's-

[02:56:04] Speaker 43: At level one, that does still hurt.

[02:56:05] Speaker 42: Yeah.

[02:56:06] Speaker 43: (laughs) But he-

[02:56:08] Speaker 42: He'd roll.

[02:56:08] Speaker 43: ... can't take more than, uh, h- like, a lot of those.

[02:56:10] Speaker 2: Actually, it doesn't help if you would have a second attack.

[02:56:11] Speaker 43: Yeah.

[02:56:11] Speaker 2: It's a incredibly long range shot here. (laughs)

[02:56:16] Speaker 42: Is that another hit?

[02:56:16] Speaker 2: That's... That's a 19 on the dice, so, um, that's gonna be a 20, a dirty 20.

[02:56:22] Speaker 43: That's a hit.

[02:56:23] Speaker 2: So, another three. He shouts something about wanting revenge and chewing your knees.

[02:56:28] Speaker 43: Okay. (laughs)

[02:56:30] Speaker 2: You assume. Um, okay. Arnor.

[02:56:39] Speaker 44: Oh, I thought I did see that one over there on the other side of the house.

[02:56:41] Speaker 45: Yeah, this one took a whizzing shot at you. Well, you do see Arelia is over there, too. You got your... Got plenty of choices.

[02:56:46] Speaker 44: Yeah.

[02:56:48] Speaker 43: The action's in the back of the yard, back here.

[02:56:50] Speaker 45: Yep. So-

[02:56:51] Speaker 44: That's where the party is.

[02:56:52] Speaker 45: I'm heading in that direction.

[02:56:53] Speaker 2: (laughs)

[02:56:54] Speaker 44: And that's where the sons of the party are coming from.

[02:56:55] Speaker 46: Party's at the back of the house.

[02:56:57] Speaker 44: Always is. It's never in the front yard.

[02:56:59] Speaker 46: (laughs)

[02:57:00] Speaker 2: Are you surprising that guy right there? He was so busy looking at, uh, Aelish, he probably didn't see you coming from around the house.

[02:57:08] Speaker 44: Uh, yeah. 17 to hit.

[02:57:12] Speaker 2: That'll hit.

[02:57:15] Speaker 44: Hey, do y'all... There's this 3D four, isn't it?

[02:57:18] Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.

[02:57:18] Speaker 44: I should be using that.

[02:57:20] Speaker 46: Do you have dark cat trick?

[02:57:21] Speaker 44: Yeah. Everybody does. It... When they added it in remastered or whatever on- Uh, seven points of damage.

[02:57:27] Speaker 45: Rage of elements.

[02:57:28] Speaker 44: Mm-hmm.

[02:57:28] Speaker 2: He's too busy looking at-

[02:57:30] Speaker 45: Falling.

[02:57:30] Speaker 2: ... Aelish up there on the balcony to see-

[02:57:31] Speaker 43: All types. Doesn't see whatever they're called. Whatever they're called.

[02:57:33] Speaker 46: Spell, uh, cl- uh-

[02:57:36] Speaker 43: Not domains.

[02:57:37] Speaker 2: Uh, who's up next?

[02:57:38] Speaker 46: Like, primals.

[02:57:38] Speaker 2: Who's next? Yes. All of them have it.

[02:57:40] Speaker 46: Uh, upkeep. If not upkeep, then Alric.

[02:57:42] Speaker 2: Uh, no upkeep.

[02:57:44] Speaker 44: All right. Well, she's right below me, so I'm gonna blast her with the needle guns since it's 3D four.

[02:57:50] Speaker 46: Don't do it.

[02:57:52] Speaker 44: Uh, that's a 24.

[02:57:54] Speaker 2: Um, on her?

[02:57:55] Speaker 44: Yeah.

[02:57:56] Speaker 2: That's just a hit.

[02:57:57] Speaker 44: That's seven points.

[02:57:58] Speaker 43: Seven and-

[02:58:00] Speaker 44: Prickly needles. She goes down.

[02:58:02] Speaker 46: What?

[02:58:04] Speaker 42: But old man wisdom bets she was-

[02:58:06] Speaker 43: She's taken a few times.

[02:58:06] Speaker 2: She was hit several times.

[02:58:07] Speaker 42: Yep.

[02:58:09] Speaker 44: All right.

[02:58:10] Speaker 46: Aelish.

[02:58:12] Speaker 44: Uh, yes.

[02:58:14] Speaker 42: Oh, you got an action left.

[02:58:15] Speaker 44: Hurt by me.

[02:58:17] Speaker 46: Oh, that's true. That's true of me.

[02:58:18] Speaker 44: How many more do I see down there? One in the 3D-

[02:58:21] Speaker 46: There's three.

[02:58:21] Speaker 2: There's two, and then as you guys know, there's two more in the gazebo. And there's one up front.

[02:58:28] Speaker 43: I thought the gazebo guys came out?

[02:58:29] Speaker 2: Nope, they came back and they went back in.

[02:58:31] Speaker 43: Oh, they s- came out and went back.

[02:58:34] Speaker 44: I gotcha. I'm gonna jump.

[02:58:37] Speaker 43: Into the bush.

[02:58:38] Speaker 44: Yeah, into the bush. I'm sure I'm gonna land on the ground.

[02:58:41] Speaker 2: Yeah. Catches his foot on the balcony. (laughs)

[02:58:47] Speaker 46: That's the bad athletic.

[02:58:48] Speaker 43: (laughs) Yeah. Falls on his face as he falls off.

[02:58:52] Speaker 2: Uh, next up.

[02:58:53] Speaker 46: A- Aelish.

[02:58:54] Speaker 44: Aelish. Uh. Nothing's actually within range, so she'll jump two.

[02:59:04] Speaker 46: Or she could attack three.

[02:59:07] Speaker 43: Yeah, 'cause no range.

[02:59:09] Speaker 44: It's like, I don't have any range left.

[02:59:10] Speaker 43: She's a melee.

[02:59:11] Speaker 46: Oh.

[02:59:11] Speaker 2: Well, she'd know her r-... Her melee has a 10-foot range.

[02:59:14] Speaker 43: Yeah, but it's-

[02:59:15] Speaker 44: Yeah, but I don't think-

[02:59:15] Speaker 43: It's 15 feet off the ground.

[02:59:17] Speaker 44: Yeah.

[02:59:17] Speaker 2: Well, yeah, I know you'd have to jump down, but once you jump down-

[02:59:20] Speaker 44: Yeah.

[02:59:20] Speaker 43: We both have reach.

[02:59:21] Speaker 2: She's jumping.

[02:59:21] Speaker 44: I was just wondering if she was gonna land on her feet.

[02:59:23] Speaker 43: Oh.

[02:59:23] Speaker 44: Yeah.

[02:59:24] Speaker 2: So, she doesn't have athletic or acrobatics, just athletics, so 14.

[02:59:29] Speaker 43: Um, I'd say that's enough.

[02:59:30] Speaker 44: Okay. Just a little... She could... Through there, and then she's gonna attack them. Ooh, look at that. That's a good roll. That'd be a 20.

[02:59:41] Speaker 2: Okay, so that trips them.

[02:59:43] Speaker 44: All right.

[02:59:43] Speaker 2: She always tries to trip first and then...

[02:59:45] Speaker 44: Six points.

[02:59:48] Speaker 2: Well-

[02:59:48] Speaker 44: Oh, no. It's a trip.

[02:59:49] Speaker 43: It's a trip, yeah.

[02:59:50] Speaker 2: The first one's trips and the second one is the... She always tries to trip you first.

[02:59:53] Speaker 44: Oh, that doesn't do any damage.

[02:59:54] Speaker 2: Yeah.

[02:59:55] Speaker 43: It's good. I like it.

[02:59:56] Speaker 44: You're talking the vine whip, right?

[02:59:57] Speaker 43: She and I-

[02:59:58] Speaker 2: Yeah.

[02:59:58] Speaker 43: ... are gonna be close friends.

[02:59:59] Speaker 44: So, it's the DC16 reflex.

[03:00:01] Speaker 43: She's my next-

[03:00:02] Speaker 2: Oh, that's right. Yeah. I'll change it to 16.

[03:00:03] Speaker 43: She's my next down time buddy.

[03:00:04] Speaker 44: (laughs) Yeah, that might be a good idea.

[03:00:07] Speaker 43: Because, like, eventually-

[03:00:08] Speaker 44: On the tails.

[03:00:09] Speaker 43: ... we could team up.

[03:00:11] Speaker 44: Yeah.

[03:00:11] Speaker 2: So, did, um, let's see-

[03:00:12] Speaker 43: She trips, I trip, we all trip.

[03:00:15] Speaker 44: Ooh, look at that.

[03:00:15] Speaker 43: I eventually get reactions.

[03:00:17] Speaker 44: That's 18, so 23, that'd be an 18.

[03:00:21] Speaker 2: Yeah.

[03:00:21] Speaker 44: No, that's the second attack, so it'd be a 13.

[03:00:24] Speaker 2: Uh, that's... Yeah, that'll hit.

[03:00:26] Speaker 44: That's still six points.

[03:00:27] Speaker 2: So, she basically jumps up and down on you.

[03:00:30] Speaker 46: (laughs)

[03:00:31] Speaker 2: She basically Mario's them.

[03:00:33] Speaker 43: (laughs) Yeah.

[03:00:33] Speaker 44: (laughs) All right. Yeah, that seems to be real for you.

[03:00:38] Speaker 46: Those turtle shells are annoying though, let's be real. Uh, five and six.

[03:00:43] Speaker 43: I'm also like a-

[03:00:43] Speaker 2: I think they're dead.

[03:00:44] Speaker 43: ... natural-

[03:00:45] Speaker 46: Now they're in the gazebo.

[03:00:46] Speaker 43: ... nature.

[03:00:47] Speaker 44: Oh, they're in nature. They're gonna s- come out and take a shot-

[03:00:49] Speaker 43: But probably will move along anyway.

[03:00:50] Speaker 44: ... and move back.

[03:00:51] Speaker 2: Yeah.

[03:00:52] Speaker 44: They'll probably have a straight shot on you two. So, on Aelish first. They're gonna basically just move out six, shoot, and move back. They're gonna be within the range of you guys at that point.

[03:01:01] Speaker 43: I mean, it's good to-

[03:01:02] Speaker 2: Um, Aelish.

[03:01:03] Speaker 44: ... get them all on to some degree.

[03:01:04] Speaker 2: They're gonna crit Aelish for two points.

[03:01:05] Speaker 44: What? Bitch.

[03:01:07] Speaker 43: Yeah.

[03:01:07] Speaker 44: Okay, so that's six down.

[03:01:08] Speaker 2: Against, uh, Totall. They're gonna crit again. (laughs)

[03:01:11] Speaker 44: Uh.

[03:01:12] Speaker 2: For six points. I got two 20s in a row, one and a four for damage. And they move back in and they're done.

[03:01:19] Speaker 44: Um, do you have like little Post-It notes for, uh, track, rather than keeping in mind?

[03:01:23] Speaker 2: You can just write on the paper if you want to 'cause every level, I'm gonna print out a new one.

[03:01:27] Speaker 44: Oh, okay.

[03:01:28] Speaker 43: We're gonna do levels after this. He said-

[03:01:30] Speaker 2: Keep the pencil.

[03:01:31] Speaker 44: Well, I didn't know if she was gonna change.

[03:01:32] Speaker 46: Uh, I'm a mess.

[03:01:33] Speaker 44: How much she was gonna change.

[03:01:34] Speaker 43: They follow... They follow along with us.

[03:01:35] Speaker 44: Yeah.

[03:01:36] Speaker 46: I'm gonna poke... I'm up next. I'm gonna poke, um, um, I'm gonna shoot.

[03:01:40] Speaker 2: Take a shot at them.

[03:01:41] Speaker 46: Number... Was it number nine?

[03:01:43] Speaker 2: Yep. And you... He is five footed against you since he was hidden.

[03:01:46] Speaker 46: Yes.

[03:01:54] Speaker 25: 19.

[03:01:55] Speaker 2: That hits. (dramatic music)

[03:01:57] Speaker 25: Probably both die. Six points down.

[03:02:00] Speaker 2: Yup, that kills him. He goes down.

[03:02:03] Speaker 25: Uh, and then, is that... I don't see anyone else. No, I don't-

[03:02:08] Speaker 47: Nope, he's dead.

[03:02:09] Speaker 25: Um-

[03:02:09] Speaker 47: Nobody else standing up, up here. Other than Arnor.

[03:02:14] Speaker 2: Yeah, you're surrounded by a bunch of corpses down there.

[03:02:16] Speaker 25: Uh, I'm gonna, uh, start making... On that side, make my way towards the-

[03:02:22] Speaker 9: See if Talos says that the cleansing flame of Talos will clean all-

[03:02:27] Speaker 47: There you go.

[03:02:27] Speaker 9: ... imperfections from the world.

[03:02:29] Speaker 25: Uh, yes.

[03:02:29] Speaker 47: Like suture.

[03:02:29] Speaker 2: You have one more left?

[03:02:31] Speaker 9: Uh-

[03:02:32] Speaker 2: Would you? Yeah, you, you...

[03:02:33] Speaker 47: The cleansing flames-

[03:02:34] Speaker 2: They shot you down too.

[03:02:34] Speaker 9: ... of Urania.

[03:02:35] Speaker 2: So-

[03:02:35] Speaker 47: Yeah.

[03:02:36] Speaker 2: You could also-

[03:02:36] Speaker 25: Moving.

[03:02:37] Speaker 2: She'd be about right here.

[03:02:39] Speaker 47: Oh, nice.

[03:02:40] Speaker 25: And number nine dies.

[03:02:41] Speaker 2: Yup.

[03:02:42] Speaker 25: Uh-

[03:02:43] Speaker 2: Guys only have three left.

[03:02:44] Speaker 9: Is there another creature in that side?

[03:02:45] Speaker 25: That is my turn.

[03:02:46] Speaker 2: Not on-

[03:02:47] Speaker 9: No, no.

[03:02:47] Speaker 2: This side, nope, everyone's-

[03:02:48] Speaker 25: Uh, F me as the leader.

[03:02:49] Speaker 2: Slew of dead ones. Leader's-

[03:02:50] Speaker 9: He's dead.

[03:02:51] Speaker 2: ... dead but on leader's initiative. This one is also-

[03:02:53] Speaker 25: This is Jurassic Park music.

[03:02:54] Speaker 2: Oh, this is Conan the Barbarian.

[03:02:55] Speaker 25: Oh.

[03:02:56] Speaker 2: He has two people he can charge.

[03:02:57] Speaker 47: Much better movie.

[03:02:58] Speaker 2: Um, he's gonna sorta roll off here. Well, actually, he can put one attack on both of you.

[03:03:02] Speaker 25: Which one? Who do you think he's put?

[03:03:02] Speaker 2: Conan is.

[03:03:03] Speaker 25: Hmm.

[03:03:04] Speaker 2: He's going to attack first, um, even... Here, let's... Oh, I'm so sorry.

[03:03:10] Speaker 9: It's very-

[03:03:10] Speaker 2: For Aelish. With the-

[03:03:12] Speaker 47: What do you... Oh, you need the-

[03:03:13] Speaker 48: (plastic rustling)

[03:03:15] Speaker 2: On Aelish, he will hit for one point of damage.

[03:03:19] Speaker 47: Okay.

[03:03:20] Speaker 2: On... With his ring increment penalties, it'll be a natural 20, I think, just to hit.

[03:03:24] Speaker 47: (laughs)

[03:03:24] Speaker 2: He's gonna miss on that. So now he's-

[03:03:26] Speaker 47: Okay.

[03:03:26] Speaker 2: ... all done. What did the-

[03:03:29] Speaker 9: Good thing.

[03:03:29] Speaker 2: ... lady do? What did the leader lady do?

[03:03:33] Speaker 47: She died.

[03:03:33] Speaker 9: She's hit.

[03:03:33] Speaker 25: Oh, I forgot she died.

[03:03:35] Speaker 2: She got hit several times, yeah. By the other-

[03:03:37] Speaker 9: She got shot when she was in the window, but-

[03:03:38] Speaker 25: One and two were next unless they just went.

[03:03:41] Speaker 2: Um, yeah. So the only ones left are the two who died.

[03:03:44] Speaker 9: Said that a couple times.

[03:03:44] Speaker 2: It's five and six. Everyone else is dead except for the ladies.

[03:03:48] Speaker 25: So one and two are dead.

[03:03:49] Speaker 9: Who's in the gazebo?

[03:03:51] Speaker 25: Five and six.

[03:03:52] Speaker 2: Five and six are the only ones left.

[03:03:54] Speaker 25: Oh.

[03:03:55] Speaker 2: Well, five and six, and technically keep her in initiative order because the one she raised happens on her initiative. That's the-

[03:04:02] Speaker 25: Oh.

[03:04:02] Speaker 9: Well, he's dead.

[03:04:03] Speaker 25: I just, like, threw him out.

[03:04:04] Speaker 9: Oh, no.

[03:04:04] Speaker 2: That's fine.

[03:04:04] Speaker 9: He's not. He just went. Like how

[03:04:06] Speaker 49: He just went. He probably won't be alive.

[03:04:07] Speaker 25: So five and six are the only-

[03:04:09] Speaker 47: If he moved, yeah.

[03:04:09] Speaker 25: ... ones alive still. Okay. I am now-

[03:04:11] Speaker 9: I'm the leader. The leader has a minion.

[03:04:14] Speaker 2: She died, but you guys are gonna kill him. Just, uh... He's not gonna live to see his next turn.

[03:04:17] Speaker 25: Ah.

[03:04:18] Speaker 9: Yeah, it's, it's not a foregone conclusion that I don't die or go down there.

[03:04:22] Speaker 25: Well, after everyone is dead, you would be after me, then.

[03:04:26] Speaker 9: Um, I think so. That's all. I'm close. I can... Am I within 10 feet of him or do I need to move?

[03:04:34] Speaker 47: You're right next to him.

[03:04:36] Speaker 9: Okay. Yeah.

[03:04:37] Speaker 2: The one that she raised is standing right next to you.

[03:04:45] Speaker 9: I can't remember. No. Um, I don't have that high of a AC. My third attack could actually hit. Not if... But I can't roll above a 10. Um, that's two actions. Third action is parry.

[03:05:06] Speaker 2: Okay.

[03:05:06] Speaker 25: Arnor.

[03:05:09] Speaker 9: I rolled a one, an eight-

[03:05:10] Speaker 25: He's on this side.

[03:05:11] Speaker 9: ... and a seven.

[03:05:11] Speaker 2: From where you are, I'd say you could see the guys in there because he was fairly open-

[03:05:15] Speaker 9: Very good.

[03:05:15] Speaker 2: ... but they're gonna have solid cover. Just find another-

[03:05:17] Speaker 50: Yeah, they're too far away from my spell anyway. (laughs)

[03:05:20] Speaker 47: Oh, yeah.

[03:05:20] Speaker 50: It's got a 60-foot range, which is quite good, but-

[03:05:23] Speaker 2: Um...

[03:05:23] Speaker 50: You know, that's a-

[03:05:24] Speaker 2: 60 feet, that would be, what? Um-

[03:05:27] Speaker 50: 12 inches?

[03:05:28] Speaker 9: 12 inches, yeah.

[03:05:28] Speaker 50: Yeah, so.

[03:05:29] Speaker 47: You gotta get that feat to, uh, double your range or add an extra 30 feet.

[03:05:33] Speaker 50: Nice. Should I have-

[03:05:37] Speaker 48: I think you took that feat. What feat did I take?

[03:05:40] Speaker 9: What feat did I take?

[03:05:40] Speaker 48: It's like, uh-

[03:05:42] Speaker 9: What feat? This is basically a metamagic-y thing. They're all feats now, right?

[03:05:47] Speaker 50: There's a feat that you-

[03:05:50] Speaker 48: You and her, though.

[03:05:51] Speaker 50: ... add 30 feet to your ranged spells.

[03:05:51] Speaker 2: Well, she's your ally. Oh, right. I forget.

[03:05:53] Speaker 48: I took toughness up.

[03:05:54] Speaker 2: That's Aelish. She has really weird feet.

[03:05:56] Speaker 50: Yeah, okay.

[03:05:57] Speaker 25: Me, compared to the ones-

[03:05:58] Speaker 9: There's a little dude over next to me-

[03:06:00] Speaker 50: Oh.

[03:06:00] Speaker 9: ... who's alive 'cause I missed him three times.

[03:06:01] Speaker 2: Oh, yeah. There is the one guy. No. Oh, yeah, that's right, yeah.

[03:06:04] Speaker 50: Yeah, he's within range.

[03:06:05] Speaker 9: So I missed him three times. Please take him out.

[03:06:08] Speaker 47: Yeah.

[03:06:08] Speaker 48: You can take a feat, yeah, that's like too high level.

[03:06:10] Speaker 9: I mean, you have a move or did you-

[03:06:12] Speaker 50: I already moved.

[03:06:13] Speaker 2: If he just were slightly over a little bit further-

[03:06:15] Speaker 48: Yeah.

[03:06:16] Speaker 2: ... I'd see if I can shot him.

[03:06:16] Speaker 48: I don't remember what level that's set at. So-

[03:06:17] Speaker 2: Where you're not, uh, two levels away.

[03:06:19] Speaker 48: Extends your range, so.

[03:06:22] Speaker 50: Uh. (grunts) 14 to hit.

[03:06:23] Speaker 2: That'll hit.

[03:06:25] Speaker 48: Kill him, please.

[03:06:25] Speaker 2: It's not possible for him to live, but... Yeah, when they're res, they only have three hit points.

[03:06:30] Speaker 48: Okay.

[03:06:30] Speaker 50: So one, one, one. I did seven.

[03:06:33] Speaker 2: Okay. You splatter him.

[03:06:36] Speaker 9: Okay, good news. He's not gonna kill me on this turn.

[03:06:40] Speaker 50: All right, that's my turn.

[03:06:40] Speaker 9: I have an enormous amount of hit points left.

[03:06:42] Speaker 25: Uh, upkeep. (laughs)

[03:06:43] Speaker 9: Actually, it's not fair. I have an enormous amount of hit points left.

[03:06:47] Speaker 25: Up- upkeep.

[03:06:48] Speaker 2: I'll keep nothing on that one.

[03:06:49] Speaker 48: Oh, there's two in there. Okay.

[03:06:51] Speaker 9: It's a singular-

[03:06:52] Speaker 48: So, I'm up, huh?

[03:06:53] Speaker 9: ... singular hit point. Let's see. Eh.

[03:06:58] Speaker 50: No, no, that's fine.

[03:06:59] Speaker 9: The roof.

[03:07:00] Speaker 47: Come on.

[03:07:01] Speaker 9: The roof will pop off. It's magnetic?

[03:07:05] Speaker 48: Yeah.

[03:07:06] Speaker 25: I didn't grab it hard enough.

[03:07:07] Speaker 2: Me, for that one, is this... What I hate about this is they-

[03:07:11] Speaker 48: It's low.

[03:07:11] Speaker 2: ... it looks really cool from the outside. On the inside, it's just a-

[03:07:14] Speaker 9: It's really cold.

[03:07:15] Speaker 2: ... how you're gonna get miniatures moved around is just... You almost better get a battle map down and just stencil it at that point. Um, and you get to, like, in the attic and it's just like...

[03:07:24] Speaker 48: Those are gonna be tiny, I'm sure.

[03:07:26] Speaker 47: Uh, well, I'm just gonna stand up in the bushes and blast them.

[03:07:32] Speaker 2: They are gonna have solid cover as there's plenty of-

[03:07:35] Speaker 47: That's fine.

[03:07:35] Speaker 2: ... stuff in between, but you still gotta get a shot off.

[03:07:36] Speaker 47: Yeah, I'm not gonna be able to do anything else, so.

[03:07:38] Speaker 2: Very sea snot terrific.

[03:07:40] Speaker 47: Oh, look at that anyway. That's a crit. 24.

[03:07:44] Speaker 9: Oh, no. That's a crit.

[03:07:45] Speaker 47: No, that's a 26.

[03:07:46] Speaker 9: It's still a crit.

[03:07:47] Speaker 47: Because I got a plus eight.

[03:07:48] Speaker 9: They have 13 AC.

[03:07:49] Speaker 47: Oh, even better.

[03:07:50] Speaker 9: Although-

[03:07:50] Speaker 2: Well, then I even still-

[03:07:50] Speaker 9: They have solid cover, which is a minus.

[03:07:53] Speaker 48: You have 15?

[03:07:53] Speaker 47: Well, even if it's not a crit, it's still a-

[03:07:54] Speaker 9: Cover adds to their AC.

[03:07:55] Speaker 47: Yeah.

[03:07:56] Speaker 9: It doesn't subtract from it.

[03:07:56] Speaker 2: No, I'm trying to remember what that was. It's plus-

[03:07:58] Speaker 9: It's either one, two, or five.

[03:07:59] Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean, they have the plus two, so they'd be at 15 AC.

[03:08:03] Speaker 51: But you were only 26.

[03:08:05] Speaker 52: Mm-hmm.

[03:08:05] Speaker 2: Okay, yep. I have a crit.

[03:08:07] Speaker 51: Right.

[03:08:07] Speaker 52: Uh-

[03:08:08] Speaker 53: So, it's 16 points.

[03:08:09] Speaker 51: (laughs)

[03:08:10] Speaker 53: Just-

[03:08:10] Speaker 2: Yeah.

[03:08:10] Speaker 51: Without the crit he was dead.

[03:08:11] Speaker 2: Yeah. (laughs) So, you see Steenil-

[03:08:12] Speaker 52: He's still dead. (laughs)

[03:08:13] Speaker 2: ... bits and pieces spraying out the back side of the, uh, gazebo.

[03:08:15] Speaker 51: It was a headshot.

[03:08:16] Speaker 52: Yep.

[03:08:17] Speaker 51: And you see brain matter fly out the back end.

[03:08:18] Speaker 52: Yep, sniped him.

[03:08:20] Speaker 54: Alysh-

[03:08:20] Speaker 52: One of the needle darts right through the eyeball.

[03:08:22] Speaker 54: (laughs)

[03:08:23] Speaker 53: Uh, and then Alysh is going to create an apple in her hand.

[03:08:26] Speaker 54: Okay.

[03:08:28] Speaker 2: She is next to him. If she wants to spend an action, she can create an apple in her hand to shove it in his mouth with a second action.

[03:08:36] Speaker 54: Here, have apple.

[03:08:36] Speaker 52: The other is the same. Yeah, so yeah...

[03:08:39] Speaker 51: It means I don't have to use an action this turn?

[03:08:40] Speaker 52: Yeah.

[03:08:41] Speaker 51: At this point?

[03:08:41] Speaker 52: Yeah, but why would I want to do that? Okay.

[03:08:44] Speaker 51: Well, what else is... She's gotta do something else if she's got a weapon, kill the other dude.

[03:08:47] Speaker 53: You can take four points.

[03:08:49] Speaker 2: She still has one action left.

[03:08:50] Speaker 53: Yeah.

[03:08:50] Speaker 2: So, she can... And she does have a ranged spell.

[03:08:53] Speaker 53: It's only 10 feet.

[03:08:55] Speaker 2: No, her... The other one should be a two action... Oh, it's a two action spell. She can't do it anyways. This is 60 foot.

[03:09:01] Speaker 53: There you go.

[03:09:03] Speaker 2: But she can't do that one 'cause she's too far.

[03:09:05] Speaker 52: 60 foot. Oh, what is that? Okay.

[03:09:08] Speaker 2: She has... Yeah, she has three actions. She has either-

[03:09:10] Speaker 53: (laughs) Wow.

[03:09:11] Speaker 52: Damn, 100%.

[03:09:11] Speaker 2: ... trip one, which is her melee version or-

[03:09:13] Speaker 51: She didn't waste it. If you, um, if you don't... If you just wanna give me the apple, that's fine too.

[03:09:17] Speaker 52: Uh, uh, already done. She's just gonna roll the attack.

[03:09:19] Speaker 2: The attack one doesn't do much damage. It's more typically to... She does supplemental stuff basically.

[03:09:25] Speaker 52: Watch it. It's uneven ground over here, careful.

[03:09:27] Speaker 51: Combat control? (laughs) All right, battlefield control.

[03:09:29] Speaker 52: (laughs) Uh, she's there but she's not gonna stay there-

[03:09:32] Speaker 51: (laughs)

[03:09:32] Speaker 52: ... so I'm just giving her a resuscitate.

[03:09:33] Speaker 2: (laughs) Next up?

[03:09:37] Speaker 54: Uh, five and six. Well, okay, just six.

[03:09:40] Speaker 2: Just six? He has one person left. It's all, it's death or glory now. He's gonna come to the front there where Alysh is and try to, uh...

[03:09:51] Speaker 51: Who's going to get the final killing blow?

[03:09:53] Speaker 53: Yeah, perfect. (laughs)

[03:09:54] Speaker 54: I've got no glory?

[03:09:55] Speaker 2: Um, that's gonna be a 20 something or other for one point of damage.

[03:09:59] Speaker 51: No one killed me, huh?

[03:10:00] Speaker 52: Okay.

[03:10:00] Speaker 51: Oh, before that.

[03:10:01] Speaker 2: He's doing melee so he'll do this last attack here.

[03:10:03] Speaker 52: She's still up.

[03:10:05] Speaker 2: He'll miss on the other attack.

[03:10:06] Speaker 52: Okay.

[03:10:08] Speaker 54: Uh, me. Uh, I'm way far away.

[03:10:11] Speaker 52: Oh, she's going to use her reaction.

[03:10:13] Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.

[03:10:14] Speaker 52: Hoo, she got-

[03:10:15] Speaker 54: Ah.

[03:10:15] Speaker 52: She got tripping bullshit? Her cloak of vines.

[03:10:18] Speaker 51: Oh.

[03:10:19] Speaker 54: Is that-

[03:10:19] Speaker 52: You can make a basic reflex save. It doesn't give the DC though. Um-

[03:10:24] Speaker 51: Probably class DC.

[03:10:25] Speaker 54: Just by four.

[03:10:26] Speaker 51: Does she have a class DC?

[03:10:27] Speaker 2: It should be... Yeah, it should be her class DC so whatever the DC of her other spell is.

[03:10:31] Speaker 52: 16.

[03:10:31] Speaker 2: Okay. Um, she... Maybe, well, it was what's a reflex save? DC of 16. I think it's a basic fail.

[03:10:39] Speaker 52: It's, uh, it's either pass or save... Uh, pass or save so pass or fail.

[03:10:45] Speaker 2: Well, I mean they could potentially crit, fail, um.

[03:10:48] Speaker 52: Two damage on fail. Yeah.

[03:10:49] Speaker 2: But she fails and takes, yeah, two damage.

[03:10:53] Speaker 52: I think I'm good.

[03:10:53] Speaker 2: It's still up but not, it's still not healthy, not healthy now.

[03:10:57] Speaker 51: Next.

[03:10:58] Speaker 54: Me.

[03:11:00] Speaker 2: I mean, you're... What's the range on your bow?

[03:11:02] Speaker 52: She only has two actions.

[03:11:02] Speaker 51: She has crossbow action, 60?

[03:11:03] Speaker 52: The first charge.

[03:11:03] Speaker 54: It's 90. Or, uh-

[03:11:05] Speaker 51: 9.

[03:11:05] Speaker 54: No, 16.

[03:11:05] Speaker 52: Okay.

[03:11:06] Speaker 2: So, a foot for one. You can get to there. What, what's your speed? It was...

[03:11:14] Speaker 54: 30.

[03:11:14] Speaker 2: 30, so you go six. She went-

[03:11:17] Speaker 51: She has a long shot.

[03:11:18] Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean you could go here and then take a shlong shot at him at a one range penalty. So, you're basically just going to have a negative two to your shot but-

[03:11:29] Speaker 54: Oh.

[03:11:29] Speaker 2: It's gonna be a negative three... Well-

[03:11:30] Speaker 54: Negative two to the attack?

[03:11:32] Speaker 2: Yeah.

[03:11:32] Speaker 51: Yes.

[03:11:33] Speaker 2: 'Cause you're-

[03:11:34] Speaker 51: When you go from past your range it's minus two for ranging.

[03:11:36] Speaker 53: She attacking six?

[03:11:36] Speaker 2: Yeah, last guy in the fail field.

[03:11:39] Speaker 54: Dude, I'm trying to-

[03:11:40] Speaker 51: Don't know about that.

[03:11:40] Speaker 2: He does have a little bit of cover too but...

[03:11:42] Speaker 52: Yeah.

[03:11:43] Speaker 2: It's... But you still have a shot at him.

[03:11:44] Speaker 52: Yeah, it's always a 20, might as well give it a shot.

[03:11:45] Speaker 51: You just, you got 14. Just roll and get a 14.

[03:11:49] Speaker 54: 10.

[03:11:50] Speaker 51: That's a miss.

[03:11:51] Speaker 2: Oh, what's plus your...?

[03:11:53] Speaker 54: Six plus-

[03:11:54] Speaker 51: Plus six, minus two.

[03:11:56] Speaker 54: 14.

[03:11:57] Speaker 51: That hits.

[03:11:58] Speaker 2: Yep.

[03:11:58] Speaker 51: Probably 'cause it right-

[03:12:00] Speaker 2: Yeah, right hit him 'cause he's

[03:12:01] Speaker 55: And then you cover or, uh-

[03:12:02] Speaker 2: I'm gonna basic cover him.

[03:12:04] Speaker 53: Yeah, why not?

[03:12:04] Speaker 54: You cover?

[03:12:04] Speaker 51: Basic cover?

[03:12:05] Speaker 2: I'll just give it to you since it's only one change 'cause yeah, it's right on the dot.

[03:12:08] Speaker 51: I was gonna kill him with my turn.

[03:12:10] Speaker 2: Oh. Well, if he has less than four.

[03:12:13] Speaker 52: I don't know, you did kill another guy last time.

[03:12:14] Speaker 53: (laughs)

[03:12:14] Speaker 54: Where... Do I get... Is he flatfooted for me?

[03:12:16] Speaker 2: No, 'cause you haven't...

[03:12:18] Speaker 54: Hold on then, I'll just-

[03:12:18] Speaker 53: Oh, you already took two points, so you don't have to do too much.

[03:12:21] Speaker 54: Three.

[03:12:21] Speaker 53: (laughs) He's out, who's next?

[03:12:23] Speaker 51: (laughs)

[03:12:25] Speaker 2: You go after her.

[03:12:26] Speaker 51: Is it me?

[03:12:28] Speaker 53: Ardar.

[03:12:28] Speaker 54: Yeah, it's up to you. (laughs)

[03:12:29] Speaker 51: So basically Kotal pulls out a shuriken.

[03:12:32] Speaker 53: (laughs)

[03:12:32] Speaker 52: (laughs)

[03:12:33] Speaker 51: It's definitely a range increment but he doesn't care 'cause he's not moving and he's gonna chuck the shuriken at this dude.

[03:12:39] Speaker 52: I'm gonna laugh if you fail.

[03:12:40] Speaker 53: (laughs)

[03:12:42] Speaker 51: I might. I got...

[03:12:45] Speaker 52: And Ardar gets to steal the kill.

[03:12:47] Speaker 54: (laughs)

[03:12:47] Speaker 51: It is, uh, uh, 19 minus two.

[03:12:53] Speaker 53: Oh, hey.

[03:12:53] Speaker 51: 17.

[03:12:54] Speaker 54: 17 for-

[03:12:54] Speaker 2: Even with some cover, it's still gonna hit.

[03:12:56] Speaker 51: ... per, uh, eight points of piercing damage. So-

[03:12:58] Speaker 52: Yeah, unfortunately, he's immune to shuriken damage.

[03:13:00] Speaker 53: (laughs)

[03:13:01] Speaker 51: (laughs)

[03:13:02] Speaker 2: So basically, she's being chomped on by her climb of... Her cloak of vines, he has a bolt coming out of the side of his head and then you sit there and pump a shuriken into him.

[03:13:10] Speaker 53: (laughs)

[03:13:11] Speaker 52: Yeah.

[03:13:11] Speaker 2: So he's dead from three different ways.

[03:13:12] Speaker 53: (coughs)

[03:13:13] Speaker 54: After I was at that group, I ran before I handed it over to my, one of the other players, the artificer. There was when he had a mechanical chicken familiar that steal... Kills left and right, man.

[03:13:24] Speaker 52: (laughs)

[03:13:24] Speaker 53: (laughs)

[03:13:25] Speaker 54: It was so funny.

[03:13:26] Speaker 52: So I always got that one kill stealer.

[03:13:28] Speaker 54: Yeah.

[03:13:29] Speaker 2: So with that, you guys have killed the last of them.

[03:13:33] Speaker 51: What are these? Can I make a recall on those?

[03:13:36] Speaker 2: We call them skebs.

[03:13:37] Speaker 51: The little ones are?

[03:13:39] Speaker 52: Yeah, they're like this.

[03:13:39] Speaker 53: She was a skeb.

[03:13:40] Speaker 2: She- she's also, she's the-

[03:13:41] Speaker 51: Oh, she's the same, she's just bossy over us.

[03:13:43] Speaker 2: Yeah.

[03:13:43] Speaker 54: Do I need to do-

[03:13:43] Speaker 2: She's a skeb sorceress.

[03:13:44] Speaker 54: ... initiative checker anymore?

[03:13:45] Speaker 51: No. Well...

[03:13:46] Speaker 2: Since they're all at 10 o'clock too, so it's probably a good time to... Yep, so you guys finish up. Um, well, if you guys don't mind going a few minutes further?

[03:13:54] Speaker 52: Yeah, investigate the house and then call it?

[03:13:56] Speaker 51: Yep. You investigate the house, um. Roll, um, you do find- Perceptions for searches or anything?

[03:14:06] Speaker 2: So, you didn't get to do all the hidden rooms.

[03:14:08] Speaker 26: I will detect magic. Yeah, I saw that. Yeah, it's, uh, blocked off. (laughs)

[03:14:11] Speaker 2: (laughs) Yeah. That's the thing about this is, yeah, they have all these little secret things hidden in the house-

[03:14:16] Speaker 26: (laughs) But you can see them. (laughs)

[03:14:16] Speaker 2: But if you're role-playing this and you just see them... Like, there's a bookcase here that opens up.

[03:14:21] Speaker 26: Oh, does it actually open up?

[03:14:21] Speaker 2: Yeah, actually.

[03:14:22] Speaker 26: Oh, that's cool.

[03:14:22] Speaker 2: Mm-hmm. There's a fireplace right there. There's a door you can pop open.

[03:14:26] Speaker 26: Oh, I saw there's some on the bottom level too.

[03:14:28] Speaker 2: Yep, and there's some down there and then it leads up top.

[03:14:30] Speaker 26: Every good mansion-

[03:14:31] Speaker 2: You get a-

[03:14:31] Speaker 26: ... has to have at least one secret room.

[03:14:33] Speaker 2: You get up top and there's some more.

[03:14:34] Speaker 56: Oh. That opens up too?

[03:14:36] Speaker 2: Yeah.

[03:14:37] Speaker 56: Ooh.

[03:14:37] Speaker 2: There's two different sides in there. Basically-

[03:14:40] Speaker 26: And then this one comes off too, it looks like.

[03:14:41] Speaker 2: Yeah, that one come off. So, if you take the secret door, like from the cabinet, you get up to this side. Otherwise, this is the normal way that goes through this one right here.

[03:14:49] Speaker 26: Nice.

[03:14:50] Speaker 2: And you get up there and you get into the little crow's nest up top.

[03:14:53] Speaker 56: Let's hurry up.

[03:14:54] Speaker 2: Um, so-

[03:14:55] Speaker 26: I say we call this as our house.

[03:14:56] Speaker 56: This belongs to somebody who just bought it.

[03:14:59] Speaker 2: Well, you guys go search through. You do find some things-

[03:15:01] Speaker 26: Possession is (laughs) 11/10ths of the law.

[03:15:03] Speaker 56: (laughs)

[03:15:04] Speaker 2: Um, so as you're going through, we're gonna assume you guys got through some of the, um, hidden stuff. Um, you do find a, uh, rapier, which looks-

[03:15:13] Speaker 26: That's, uh-

[03:15:14] Speaker 2: ... kind of nice.

[03:15:14] Speaker 26: ... intere- it's oddly convenient.

[03:15:18] Speaker 2: If you lick it, it has a very interesting taste.

[03:15:22] Speaker 26: Is it cold iron?

[03:15:22] Speaker 2: Like, um, like cold iron. So that is a cold iron rapier. You find a dagger that has something special about it. That's also kinda hidden away in a nook and cranny, that's kind of hidden.

[03:15:34] Speaker 26: It, it, if you want t- or that's a 20 crafting check.

[03:15:37] Speaker 2: It is a...

[03:15:40] Speaker 26: I am sold on cold iron weapons after my Gatewalker campaign.

[03:15:43] Speaker 2: It is a fanged dagger. Dagger with a fanged rune.

[03:15:47] Speaker 26: (laughs)

[03:15:48] Speaker 56: What does fanged do?

[03:15:49] Speaker 2: It's really weird. You put it in your mouth (taps on table) and then it transforms into an animal holding that weapon. (growling sound) So, it's kinda like you have three arms, basically. So, if you're, um, like, if you're a lizard, you'll pop out as a little mini lizard holding the dagger.

[03:16:03] Speaker 26: (laughs)

[03:16:03] Speaker 2: And then it gets, like, a third arm. So, you can attack with your arm-arm, or if you want to, you can have it attack with the third item that it's holding.

[03:16:10] Speaker 26: It's like a singing sword.

[03:16:11] Speaker 2: Yeah, kinda. It's a really weird-

[03:16:12] Speaker 26: Where you've got the sword-

[03:16:12] Speaker 2: You gotta look it up. It's a really weird rune.

[03:16:14] Speaker 26: Yeah.

[03:16:14] Speaker 2: Um, but yeah, if you find those two, um, uh, things there, each I think are worth a good chunk of, chunk of change.

[03:16:21] Speaker 26: Okay. Nice.

[03:16:22] Speaker 2: Put 'em in party bag.

[03:16:24] Speaker 56: I mean, the rapier I may be interested in.

[03:16:26] Speaker 2: If you want to, um, go ahead and just add... If you want the rapier, go ahead and just-

[03:16:29] Speaker 26: Yeah.

[03:16:29] Speaker 2: ... add it to your-

[03:16:29] Speaker 26: Yeah, y- it's your weapon. Oh, I-

[03:16:31] Speaker 2: Cold iron rapier.

[03:16:32] Speaker 26: I could definitely use that. I'd put that at the end of my staff and I got a nice spear.

[03:16:36] Speaker 56: (laughs)

[03:16:37] Speaker 26: (laughs)

[03:16:37] Speaker 56: Nice bayonet. Yeah, you got your bayonet going on there, sir.

[03:16:40] Speaker 26: Cold iron, cold iron rapier. All right, anything else of interest?

[03:16:47] Speaker 2: So, um, let me... Just a second here. Uh, you do... And we can... End part of this, we can just do next session. So, go ahead and level up.

[03:16:58] Speaker 56: Is cold iron considered magical?

[03:17:00] Speaker 26: No.

[03:17:00] Speaker 2: No, it is a weapon proper. It's a iron type. Yeah.

[03:17:01] Speaker 26: You have to, you have to go into customization and change the weapon material. It helps with certain types of things. It's just not magical. I tell you what, like I said, I... In that Gatewalker Campaign, I had a cold iron bastard sword and I am sold on cold iron.

[03:17:13] Speaker 2: It, it came in really handy.

[03:17:15] Speaker 26: Yeah.

[03:17:16] Speaker 2: Upgrading it sucks, 'cause you can only put it, like, one rune unless you get the really super expensive one which is like 30,000 gold for-

[03:17:23] Speaker 26: But how long are... You know, you're gonna be-

[03:17:25] Speaker 2: It's gonna last us through the campaign.

[03:17:26] Speaker 26: Well, by the time you can get a second rune anyway. Yeah, 'cause you can't put the second rune on until, what, like, seven or something like that?

[03:17:32] Speaker 2: Six? Eight?

[03:17:33] Speaker 26: 'Cause you did find out a little bit, um, it's-

[03:17:36] Speaker 56: Is this a low-grade cold iron, I'm guessing?

[03:17:40] Speaker 26: Yeah, it'd be low-grade.

[03:17:40] Speaker 2: The cheapest.

[03:17:41] Speaker 26: If it's not, we're totally selling that and then you can buy another one. (laughs)

[03:17:45] Speaker 2: Yeah. (laughs)

[03:17:45] Speaker 26: We can all buy one.

[03:17:46] Speaker 2: Otherwise, we're fucking rich. (laughs)

[03:17:48] Speaker 26: (laughs)

[03:17:48] Speaker 2: I'm retiring back to... (laughs)

[03:17:50] Speaker 26: So, you did find a few other things. I didn't have the cards for this. You found, um, bottled lightning, lesser. A potion of bottled lightning. If you wanna... Do you wanna write that on the... Well, actually, once I get the cards, I'll put it in Alicia's thing, or uh, Vivian's.

[03:18:03] Speaker 2: Yeah, stash? Um, but you do find that.

[03:18:06] Speaker 26: Okay.

[03:18:08] Speaker 2: Um, a lesser potion of anti-plague and some ghost ink.

[03:18:13] Speaker 56: Ghost ink?

[03:18:14] Speaker 2: Yep.

[03:18:16] Speaker 26: We could write secret messages to each other.

[03:18:19] Speaker 2: What's really cool is there's random loot generators. You just say what your party's level is, you say what that is, and it just generates. So, you guys are getting a bunch of weird stuff throughout this campaign.

[03:18:27] Speaker 26: I like weird stuff. I do too, actually.

[03:18:29] Speaker 2: That's how I got the... I think the rune dagger was on there and it... Yeah, randomly.

[03:18:33] Speaker 26: What's the dagger called again?

[03:18:34] Speaker 2: Fanged dagger.

[03:18:35] Speaker 26: Fanged dagger.

[03:18:35] Speaker 2: It's a fanged rune.

[03:18:35] Speaker 26: So, is that actually a rune or is that, like, a, uh, actually a unique weapon?

[03:18:39] Speaker 2: It's a rune.

[03:18:40] Speaker 26: It is a rune.

[03:18:40] Speaker 2: Yeah. You can attach to it, you can basically... I just made it a dagger-

[03:18:43] Speaker 26: It's a rune.

[03:18:43] Speaker 2: ... but it can be, um...

[03:18:45] Speaker 26: Out of those.

[03:18:45] Speaker 2: It can be other things, too. So, you guys, um, finish up. Um, a day or two later, um, you guys get this place cleaned up. It's in pretty good shape. Um, sure enough, a day or two later, you get a message from Irka that the folks had arrived. Um, they're, um, you know, they invite you since you had cleaned it out, and he says you're just gonna have to go up to the island to get paid. Um, you make your way up again. You just get off on the boats and make your way up here. Um, when you get to the, uh, um, house though, you see some weird stuff. There's like, um, well people who obviously are, like, servants, but they're just kind of milling about mindlessly, almost quasi-mindlessly, like, they're just, you know, pruning the plants but they're kinda, um, uh, standing there all zombie-like. When you guys approach, they don't seem to, to care any. Um-

[03:19:39] Speaker 26: Do they look dead?

[03:19:41] Speaker 2: Yeah.

[03:19:42] Speaker 26: Oh, well, now the house is getting burned down. (laughs)

[03:19:46] Speaker 2: So, if you go to the... Once you get close to the door, um, the door opens and, uh, a pale gentleman comes out and looks at you and says, um, "Are we expecting you?" Um-

[03:19:54] Speaker 56: This is this house?

[03:19:55] Speaker 2: Yep.

[03:19:56] Speaker 26: Yes. Is, is he tall and skinny?

[03:19:59] Speaker 2: He's the gentleman. Um, we're looking at photo books.

[03:20:03] Speaker 56: Like, the guy from, uh, Addams Family.

[03:20:05] Speaker 26: Yeah.

[03:20:06] Speaker 2: Perch.

[03:20:06] Speaker 56: Yeah.

[03:20:07] Speaker 2: No, he's a bit skinnier and taller. Where'd I put the cards?

[03:20:12] Speaker 57: Wow. We do get to claim the house now that...

[03:20:16] Speaker 58: Dude, I would live in this house.

[03:20:17] Speaker 59: Yeah. Yeah, I'll learn it.

[03:20:20] Speaker 2: This is why you don't have crap, because you're just going to put it some place you forgot where you put it. You'll find it again.

[03:20:29] Speaker 57: Um, he looks like-

[03:20:30] Speaker 60: You should, uh, you could use one of those, uh-

[03:20:32] Speaker 59: Yes.

[03:20:32] Speaker 60: ... folders of all those pictures and just reuse them.

[03:20:35] Speaker 58: Oh. Vampires?

[03:20:37] Speaker 57: Um-

[03:20:38] Speaker 58: I would never know that. I would know that.

[03:20:40] Speaker 2: Yeah. But he says, um, the lady would be happy to, um, see you and offer you a reward for preparing this place for us. Um, as you make your way in to the, you know, front area, you're greeted by another character.

[03:20:56] Speaker 60: These are from the Iron Kingdom?

[03:20:59] Speaker 2: Uh, no, you-

[03:21:00] Speaker 61: They came from the west or the east?

[03:21:01] Speaker 60: They said they were coming-

[03:21:02] Speaker 2: They came from the, uh, the west.

[03:21:04] Speaker 60: Okay. Okay.

[03:21:05] Speaker 58: Whatever.

[03:21:05] Speaker 60: So they're not actually from the Iron Kingdom but they came from the Iron Kingdom.

[03:21:07] Speaker 2: She looks like that.

[03:21:09] Speaker 58: Hmm. Do I recognize any of these people?

[03:21:12] Speaker 2: Personally, no. But their clothing is very... You understand their clothing right away. They are vampires, obviously, from the fangs. They're not really hiding that fact.

[03:21:23] Speaker 58: Can I tell what house just from clothing?

[03:21:25] Speaker 2: You know they are Von Carstein, yeah.

[03:21:27] Speaker 60: So they don't explode in the flames in the sunlight in this world?

[03:21:30] Speaker 2: Um, not in the flames, no, but it hurts them.

[03:21:33] Speaker 60: Okay.

[03:21:34] Speaker 2: But this is daytime and it's dark inside.

[03:21:36] Speaker 60: Okay. That's why I was wondering if, like, the daylight still damages vampires.

[03:21:39] Speaker 2: You don't usually see vampires outside of the Iron Kingdom, but there are some. And in the Iron Kingdoms there are actually some vampires who rule some of the duchies and small things. It's k-... There are some areas of the Iron Kingdom that are very, like, Slovenia and Eastern Europe, so you do have some dudes that do live out there. But most of the people are typically ...

[03:21:58] Speaker 59: It was foreshadowing, your comment. He said, "This reminds me of Morovia."

[03:22:03] Speaker 60: Yep. (laughs)

[03:22:04] Speaker 2: But-

[03:22:04] Speaker 59: And all of sudden there are vampire vampires.

[03:22:06] Speaker 2: So you have met, um-

[03:22:07] Speaker 60: No, that's part of the house.

[03:22:07] Speaker 2: ... she introduces herself. Um-

[03:22:09] Speaker 61: No.

[03:22:11] Speaker 59: We don't judge.

[03:22:13] Speaker 61: Oh, thank God. Yeah.

[03:22:14] Speaker 59: All things in, uh, in our nat- uh, in, that aren't naturals we cannot-

[03:22:17] Speaker 61: I haven't been working out and I've done so much to that angle in grade school.

[03:22:19] Speaker 60: That would call them natural. Helo says to judge wisely and often. (laughs)

[03:22:27] Speaker 2: I gotta remember their names again. Okay, that's Osana. She introduces her name as. Um, she just calls, uh... I keep on forgetting what-

[03:22:36] Speaker 60: This is a, another major dramatic event. So-

[03:22:37] Speaker 2: So she is, she is the last of them. You get-

[03:22:39] Speaker 59: O-S-A-N-A?

[03:22:41] Speaker 2: O-S-A-N-N-A. Osana. Um, he says, "Greetings. I am quite happy to, um, that you've emptied out this place. Um, I hope we didn't startle you, especially the little one."

[03:22:53] Speaker 59: The guy or the girl?

[03:22:54] Speaker 2: The girl.

[03:22:54] Speaker 61: The girl.

[03:22:55] Speaker 2: She seems a bit more jovial. He seems like a tight lipped butler with, like, no joy in his face. Um, but she seems to have a little bit more, she's more animated. Um, "But I'm very glad you were able to come here to be with us. Uh, please do not be, um, alarmed by our presence. Um, we bought this house and are just looking for a little, little bit of the rustic life, uh, out here in the, um, um, frontier, as it were. And maybe a change of food."

[03:23:26] Speaker 61: Well, if rustic's what you're looking for, you'll certainly find it here.

[03:23:30] Speaker 2: "Yes. Uh, there's, judging by all the little beasties out there, um, there's quite a bit of, uh, delicacies to choose from. Uh, worry yourself not. Um, we have no interest in feeding on any of you or the people at the bridge there."

[03:23:48] Speaker 58: Can I hotel, do they look like purebloods?

[03:23:52] Speaker 2: Um, go and do perceptions to see. I think your character will probably have some insight on this for sure.

[03:23:59] Speaker 59: I'm disappointed you didn't use, uh, what's her face-

[03:24:03] Speaker 58: 12 plus seven.

[03:24:04] Speaker 59: ... from the Otherworld shows.

[03:24:05] Speaker 60: (laughs).

[03:24:06] Speaker 59: Get please.

[03:24:07] Speaker 2: Oh, it's Celestine.

[03:24:08] Speaker 58: 12 plus seven.

[03:24:09] Speaker 60: What is it even though? I can't remember any of that. Well, I'll say this much, you can probably... There we go. Four and seven. That's 12. Yeah, that's right. That's 19 for the... So, um, he definitely looks like he is a, um, lowblood. Now, you have a lot of knowledge into this. You probably know if... So basically she, you can tell, um, is a wholeblood. She's not a pureblood.

[03:24:43] Speaker 58: Okay.

[03:24:44] Speaker 2: But, um, it wouldn't take too much to figure out that he's probably a servant. If he's a lowblood and is with her, that probably means he survived the initial parts of the Soul Lost and he's now pledging to get into their house.

[03:24:59] Speaker 58: Interesting.

[03:25:00] Speaker 2: So he's just probably like he's trying to, yeah, he's basically pledging, um, serving her as part of his pledge basically.

[03:25:08] Speaker 58: Got it.

[03:25:08] Speaker 2: So that something you'd probably definitely figure out about. But she says, "I am Osana." Um, and she would gather your names if you're, uh-

[03:25:16] Speaker 57: I am Gomkar Tal.

[03:25:17] Speaker 2: "I have, uh, admittedly, um, seen a few of your kind. There are some in Astoria, not many though."

[03:25:26] Speaker 57: Our blood does not taste good. (laughs)

[03:25:29] Speaker 2: I can't say that I've had any but, uh-

[03:25:31] Speaker 57: I do not recommend.

[03:25:32] Speaker 60: (laughs)

[03:25:36] Speaker 2: Um, but the rest of you I think I recognize. Um, let me-

[03:25:40] Speaker 60: I'm a connoisseur of garlic. (laughs)

[03:25:44] Speaker 2: You do get a small bit of a glare when she looks at you a little bit, um, but just kind of moves on to you guys and welcomes you in. Um, but y- they thank you. They're, if you guys are willing to, they'll chitchat for a little while or see if you have any questions you want to ask or whatnot. She seems kind of, you know, eager to lure out, uh-

[03:26:02] Speaker 59: I probably have not encountered any vampires.

[03:26:05] Speaker 2: Probably not.

[03:26:06] Speaker 59: They're not common in Primordia.

[03:26:09] Speaker 2: No, no.

[03:26:09] Speaker 59: And I came the other way around to the island, right?

[03:26:13] Speaker 2: Other than she's mentioned that there may be some in Astoria that are-

[03:26:15] Speaker 59: Yeah. But I personally have never seen one.

[03:26:16] Speaker 2: Yeah, you personally have not-

[03:26:17] Speaker 59: Run into one.

[03:26:18] Speaker 2: Yeah. Probably not.

[03:26:19] Speaker 59: This is my first.

[03:26:20] Speaker 62: That probably would be, if they're from the Iron Kingdoms. And they're, they're kind of the k- Iron Kingdoms.

[03:26:26] Speaker 2: What, what's that?

[03:26:27] Speaker 62: So, I probably would be familiar with vampires-

[03:26:28] Speaker 2: You would know of them, yeah.

[03:26:29] Speaker 62: ... from the Iron Kingdoms.

[03:26:30] Speaker 2: You have a lot more 'cause there's a... Vampires are usually never good but they can be neutral.

[03:26:35] Speaker 62: Mm-hmm.

[03:26:36] Speaker 2: Or they can be... It kinda depends. When vampires get bitten there's the, the... For some vampires can be very mean, vicious and killers. So, for like him who's a low blood-

[03:26:45] Speaker 62: Yeah.

[03:26:46] Speaker 2: Um, and this is all stuff you can kinda relate from a little bit, but they kinda go mad if they can't control after they're bitten. And then, yeah, they can go off on murderous rampages and whatnot. Beyond that, they can, if they can control their soul rot it usually is not until they really start getting to a really old age where the soul rots really eat away their soul and then they just become mean and evil. But if they're in that middle of that stage it's kinda like... And so usually they're not good because they're kind of basically a parasite, but-

[03:27:13] Speaker 62: (laughs)

[03:27:14] Speaker 2: ... they may not necessarily be evil either.

[03:27:17] Speaker 62: Mm-hmm.

[03:27:17] Speaker 2: Um, this world is also a w- a world very much you're defined by your actions. But vampires are basically a leech, they have to survive off of others or they die. That takes a toll on your psyche over time. Vampire can live up to about the age of a dwarf or an elf, so.

[03:27:32] Speaker 63: Is-

[03:27:32] Speaker 2: That many years easily.

[03:27:33] Speaker 63: So they're the Von Carsten?

[03:27:35] Speaker 2: Von Carstein, yeah. So, Von Carstein, these are, these are vampires, they look very, uh, especially like a classic-

[03:27:40] Speaker 63: Noble-esque?

[03:27:41] Speaker 2: Yeah, very noble-esque. They have the frilly...

[03:27:44] Speaker 63: Are that, is that how-

[03:27:45] Speaker 64: Ruffles.

[03:27:45] Speaker 63: ... Sulamia-

[03:27:45] Speaker 62: Ruffles. The gothic look.

[03:27:46] Speaker 63: ... are Sulamia and Von Carsten like add-ons-

[03:27:50] Speaker 64: Drusilla.

[03:27:51] Speaker 63: ... to each other?

[03:27:52] Speaker 2: They're, there's the three vampire ones, um-

[03:27:55] Speaker 62: Coffee.

[03:27:56] Speaker 2: The other being blood dragon, they're-

[03:27:58] Speaker 64: They're redoing it. I heard that. They're remaking-

[03:28:00] Speaker 2: It's not open hostilities but there's kind of like that the houses are all sort of always jostling for region.

[03:28:06] Speaker 65: It's, uh, its next generation.

[03:28:07] Speaker 63: Only one side will not fall down, right? The one that I mentioned.

[03:28:09] Speaker 64: So, Michelle can-

[03:28:10] Speaker 2: Oh, yeah. You don't have to share the note. I mean it's-

[03:28:12] Speaker 63: And I'm guessing they're probably like figured out-

[03:28:14] Speaker 62: So like the new slaves.

[03:28:15] Speaker 63: ... which realm that I'm a vampire in, but-

[03:28:15] Speaker 64: But she's like running the shop. Yeah, she's the one-

[03:28:17] Speaker 2: She thought there was... Yeah, but then maybe she thought there's something off. She may not know that she actually figured out-

[03:28:21] Speaker 65: Apparently, she's gonna be like the mentor to the new ones.

[03:28:23] Speaker 2: Um, yeah, the vampires have a very uneasy alliance. Um...

[03:28:25] Speaker 62: Because that's what I heard.

[03:28:26] Speaker 2: It, it's kinda like just a lot of rivalry and-

[03:28:29] Speaker 63: If they have blood they're willing to share.

[03:28:31] Speaker 2: Yeah. And there's, um-

[03:28:32] Speaker 64: Is this a dramatis personae?

[03:28:34] Speaker 2: Yep. She is. He is not, he's a lesser. But they're kind of, they're close associates.

[03:28:38] Speaker 63: What is her name again?

[03:28:39] Speaker 2: Osana.

[03:28:40] Speaker 62: And those definitely are zombies outside.

[03:28:42] Speaker 2: Yep. There's only a few of them. There's like three or four and they're doing gardening work. Um, but you would also know this, that the current... There's always one vampire elder. There's three vampire elders that rule over it. If you've seen Underworld, you get the point.

[03:28:57] Speaker 62: (laughs) It is Underworld.

[03:28:58] Speaker 2: Um-

[03:28:59] Speaker 62: Yeah, that's the one I saw.

[03:29:00] Speaker 2: But Victor is the one he's-

[03:29:02] Speaker 63: I have seen, I have seen Underworld. Yep. It's a good movie series.

[03:29:04] Speaker 2: He is the, um, vampire that is, the vampire elder that is currently awake, is Von Carstein. And that's Victor.

[03:29:10] Speaker 63: Okay.

[03:29:11] Speaker 2: Um, then when he goes to sleep, then it's one of the other two, Amalia or Marcus.

[03:29:15] Speaker 63: Mm-hmm.

[03:29:16] Speaker 2: Amalia is one for Sulamia-

[03:29:18] Speaker 62: (laughs) I'm sorry, I forgot who Marcus was.

[03:29:18] Speaker 2: ... and Marcus for blood dragon.

[03:29:21] Speaker 62: That's totally Underworld.

[03:29:22] Speaker 2: Yeah.

[03:29:22] Speaker 63: Yeah.

[03:29:22] Speaker 2: Well, I mean it's good-

[03:29:23] Speaker 63: And it's a good movie series.

[03:29:25] Speaker 2: But think, it's what's really nice-

[03:29:26] Speaker 62: No, no, there's nothing. I got no problem with Underworld.

[03:29:27] Speaker 2: What's really neat is I can say Victor is the head of the Von Carsteins and you instantly can picture, you know, his personality, what he's like, you know. Which is kinda why I did it, it makes it easiest to say, "Oh, yeah, right." Because he did a real good job, the actor who did him.

[03:29:40] Speaker 62: That dude, yeah.

[03:29:41] Speaker 2: Yeah.

[03:29:41] Speaker 62: I've seen him in a number of things and he's always that creepy old dude.

[03:29:43] Speaker 2: Yeah. So, yeah, yeah, that's why I kinda... So yeah, you've met and you're the only... You can ask any questions you want to now or next week. Um, but yeah, she is the last of the, uh, um, dramatis personae. She does have... They brought an extra rowboat or so, which they'll have down there, so anytime you guys want to, if you want to do a day activity you can head up here for the day.

[03:30:01] Speaker 62: What are your opinions on werewolves?

[03:30:03] Speaker 64: Was there a payment or reward for this?

[03:30:05] Speaker 2: Oh, yeah. Sure. Um, sure, because each also ten gold, which I'll hand out right here.

[03:30:09] Speaker 63: Oh.

[03:30:09] Speaker 2: And then you also hit level two, starting in next session. (instrumental music plays) I'll point out that you own a mansion, so you isn't, you don't always have to stay at the, uh...

[03:30:27] Speaker 64: Make friends.

[03:30:28] Speaker 2: Yeah.

[03:30:28] Speaker 62: I don't know that I wanna stay in a house with a bunch of vampires. (laughs)

[03:30:33] Speaker 63: Right.

[03:30:33] Speaker 62: Thanks.

[03:30:34] Speaker 2: That and that.

[03:30:37] Speaker 63: I probably would, but...

[03:30:40] Speaker 2: Well, your plot gets a little interesting here with, uh... (clears throat)

[03:30:45] Speaker 63: Oh, babe.

[03:30:46] Speaker 62: My guy would probably be real keen on vampires if they like inhabited the Iron Kingdom (laughs) and preyed on my people. But yeah.

[03:30:56] Speaker 2: There's a lot of love plot too because a lot of time... How the vampire... When they first came to Astoria, um, they, they basically... This is a little extra world order and I don't know how much of this will come out, but hurries and Greyulds, they almost pushed them to the edge of extinction, they lived in Astoria beforehand.

[03:31:10] Speaker 62: To the Elves?

[03:31:10] Speaker 2: Yep.

[03:31:11] Speaker 62: That's the center of the whole island, right?

[03:31:12] Speaker 2: Yep.

[03:31:13] Speaker 62: Yeah.

[03:31:13] Speaker 2: And, uh, there were, they were pushed to the edge of extinction. They made, there, there's the Drow which are... Could be any Elf, they serve Lolth and they go through a transformation, that's why they get their dark skin, that's so they can Drow. What the Drow did is the Drow are, in this world, they have a purpose unlike in like the D World. Basically, Lolth is survival of the Elven kind at any cost.

[03:31:35] Speaker 64: Mm-hmm.

[03:31:35] Speaker 2: So, what, um, they do is they would capture slaves from all over the place, bring them to Astoria, in exchange the vampires would leave, um, the Greyulds alone. And then what they did, what they would do is they would take the slaves, they'd serve them, the vampire houses, for two years. By that time the miasma in, uh, Astoria would have claimed them. It's kind of estrada you can't leave. Well, once a person's been in Astoria for too long, they can't leave Astoria or they get sick and die. Now there are some exceptions, Greyulds are immune to it, um, there's one or two other races that are immune to it. Um, Dhampir also immune to that.

[03:32:12] Speaker 62: The Dwarves?

[03:32:12] Speaker 2: So they can leave.

[03:32:13] Speaker 62: Oh, the Dwarves.

[03:32:14] Speaker 2: There are Dwarves, there are Dwarves in there but they're, they're claimed basically. So that's what they would do, they'd hold you for two years, t- once the miasma's claimed you, they'd set you free into Astoria.

[03:32:23] Speaker 62: You're free! You can't leave.

[03:32:23] Speaker 2: And then basically you're a food source. And that's how they built up the population in Astoria.So there are a lot of free peoples in Astoria, including some Slan. Um, but um, (glass clinking) 'cause the drought was far and wide to get delicacies, so to speak.

[03:32:38] Speaker 66: Hm.

[03:32:39] Speaker 2: But yeah that's how, uh, they got there. So and that's why I think it's, uh, Astoria's also a potential for a future campaign. Um, if you guys have ever wanted to go there that's something that could be... But yeah you could ask any questions or next week if you have any questions we'll begin, um, well not next week. We're off next week and then back the week before. And by that time you'll also be getting to where you have more choices and between missions and whatnot. But a lot of times too the missions, there's not just gonna be a... We'll actually start a little mission board and as someone gets put up there. You do have one mission that's already on the board. Um, if you guys remember that.

[03:33:15] Speaker 66: Yeah, that one? Finding the, uh, elderberries.

[03:33:17] Speaker 2: That's just a little mini... If you guys would be willing to do this for me. You can jot that down, but that's not really a mission so to speak.

[03:33:23] Speaker 66: Is that, uh, AI gonna remember that?

[03:33:26] Speaker 67: Wha- what? Remember what?

[03:33:27] Speaker 2: Probably. Uh, we are never mind you guys too.

[03:33:29] Speaker 66: The, uh, side quests? And like the, uh-

[03:33:32] Speaker 67: Well, I didn't hear what it was.

[03:33:33] Speaker 66: The elderberries?

[03:33:34] Speaker 67: Yeah.

[03:33:35] Speaker 2: Yeah. Um, Ayla should just ask you guys could do that. That's not a, necessarily a mission.

[03:33:39] Speaker 66: Okay.

[03:33:40] Speaker 2: Um, but, um, Gaz had asked if you guys want to-

[03:33:43] Speaker 66: Oh yeah. Oh yeah, return. Go to the hops.

[03:33:43] Speaker 67: Yeah, we were going to go and guard her while she took stuff to the hops.

[03:33:46] Speaker 2: So, what we'll actually do is I'll have a board here as you guys uncover the quest. We'll actually just pin it right to there so you guys know what they are. They may not all be available forever. Some of them will disappear if you don't. So you have to kind of choose which ones you want. Um-

[03:33:56] Speaker 68: Find a board or po- like job board basically?

[03:33:59] Speaker 2: Yeah.

[03:33:59] Speaker 66: Yeah.

[03:34:00] Speaker 2: But you're gonna have to talk because a lot of these, like the quest, you may have to talk to the MPCs to get.

[03:34:04] Speaker 66: Mm-hmm.

[03:34:05] Speaker 2: Um, as opposed there's not just gonna be a board in town you walk to and it has all, everything listed.

[03:34:08] Speaker 66: Yeah, no, that makes sense.

[03:34:10] Speaker 2: Um, but you never know. There'll be stuff that comes out, so. But I don't finish this up until way after tonight. I actually had a bit more fun. I didn't know how quickly you'd get through that. And then I was also really nervous 'cause it, it could have gone either really good or really bad. I was worried they'd just start hitting you like crazy and then I'd have a bunch of level ones that are getting, you know, mobbed over and killed.

[03:34:30] Speaker 66: Even though-

[03:34:30] Speaker 2: That's why I wanted her there as a, a potential healer because she has some healing too.

[03:34:35] Speaker 66: Yeah. You just never know.

[03:34:36] Speaker 67: That's the thing.

[03:34:37] Speaker 66: It's the luck of the dice.

[03:34:39] Speaker 67: Now we have a little bit more, uh, beef.

[03:34:41] Speaker 2: Yeah.

[03:34:41] Speaker 66: Yeah.

[03:34:42] Speaker 68: Oh, two, woo!

[03:34:43] Speaker 2: But there'll be a variety of things too. Or else we keep trying out some of these larger scenarios where... You were at the island, um, where, um, Rosenkranz was. And that island's actually bigger than this one is. It would've been.

[03:35:00] Speaker 66: Oh, okay.

[03:35:01] Speaker 2: Little bigger. Longer.

[03:35:02] Speaker 66: I thought you were talking about the other campaign for a second there.

[03:35:04] Speaker 2: Oh, no. No.

[03:35:05] Speaker 66: The one here, okay. And he's got a tower on there, right? It's just, just a tower on it? I can't remember.

[03:35:10] Speaker 2: There's three things. There's a little boat house, looks like a fish house, something like that. Then there's a, uh, barracks was like a guard barracks and his tower is on there too.

[03:35:19] Speaker 66: Oh, so it's actually on the island with the barracks?

[03:35:21] Speaker 2: Yeah. So there's the other one is a little bit longer.

[03:35:24] Speaker 66: Okay.

[03:35:24] Speaker 2: On, this is the side facing the bridge, there's a little boathouse. Off the side, there's a guard barracks and kind of on the far end there's another tower.

[03:35:31] Speaker 66: Okay. I was thinking Rosenkranz was separate from those. Okay.

[03:35:33] Speaker 2: He lives in the... Yeah. His is kind of on the edge of the island. It was probably at one time a lookout tower, you suspect. Then he's taken it over into his little, um-

[03:35:40] Speaker 66: Okay.

[03:35:40] Speaker 2: ... creativity hut.

[03:35:44] Speaker 66: Hmm. Okay. That works.

[03:35:48] Speaker 2: And yeah, then I should also hopefully have your guys' things set up next week too, so you can use those for-

[03:35:54] Speaker 66: Starts weeks' cost.

[03:35:55] Speaker 2: Yeah, for the balance and whatnot.

[03:35:58] Speaker 67: Are we done talking about anything?

[03:35:59] Speaker 2: Oh, yeah. No, we're... Yeah, I'm just prattling on as you guys...

[03:36:02] Speaker 67: Well, there was lots of lore and some of the lore was useful to capture.

[03:36:04] Speaker 66: Yeah.

[03:36:05] Speaker 67: All right.

[03:36:06] Speaker 2: This is stuff that maybe Areli could have told you or if not, through some general knowledge you guys might know.

[03:36:11] Speaker 68: Yeah, but don't have pregnant women live up there yet, though.

[03:36:12] Speaker 2: They know you're at least from Astoria and you would... Stuff you kind of would... Pretty much anyone in Astoria would know, like, because there's no one in Astoria who doesn't know the Victors. Like, the three houses are very well known. Anyone in Astoria would know the levels of vampire and everyone would know, um, houses.

[03:36:29] Speaker 68: I haven't told you, yeah. You guys, I don't know how to tell you.

[03:36:32] Speaker 2: Yeah, they don't know. They just think you're fr- you're a Greyhawk, which you are.

[03:36:35] Speaker 66: Yeah.
