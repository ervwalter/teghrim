[01:55:00] Speaker 1: ... to be out here?

[01:55:00] Speaker 2: Why do you have tails?

[01:55:01] Speaker 3: Aren't you too young to be out here? Damn kids. Always cranking ... (mumbling)

[01:55:07] Speaker 1: (laughs)

[01:55:09] Speaker 4: Well, then let's get going. I think we all right.

[01:55:11] Speaker 3: Think you got some mama's milk to go drink and...

[01:55:15] Speaker 4: Uh, no. I only have the finest mead here of... on this side of the river.

[01:55:20] Speaker 3: Oh, well in that case, I'm Ulric. (laughs) We should be friends.

[01:55:25] Speaker 4: Ulric?

[01:55:26] Speaker 3: Yes.

[01:55:27] Speaker 4: Some norn blood in you? Ulric could be a name for both, uh, in Fallengrow. But there are Ulrics in Northside.

[01:55:34] Speaker 3: I don't know. You gotta talk to my mama about that.

[01:55:36] Speaker 2: (laughs)

[01:55:37] Speaker 1: My head count is Ulric is 30 years old. He's just, he just aged terribly.

[01:55:42] Speaker 3: (laughs) No, he's an old fucker.

[01:55:44] Speaker 1: No, he's 30.

[01:55:45] Speaker 3: (laughs) He's 32.

[01:55:47] Speaker 1: (laughs) So, um-

[01:55:52] Speaker 3: I think I age him like 75 or something like that.

[01:55:55] Speaker 1: But you guys have now met another one of the, uh, dramatic persona. What was his name again?

[01:56:02] Speaker 2: Uh, Grul... Grimnar.

[01:56:04] Speaker 1: Grimnar.

[01:56:04] Speaker 2: Grimnar.

[01:56:05] Speaker 5: Yeah.

[01:56:06] Speaker 1: Okay. I'd have to look it up to see how I spelled that.

[01:56:08] Speaker 3: Sorry but I think I did actually age him to look like 75. Very close to my god's name.

[01:56:15] Speaker 1: Now if anyone wants to play either of those two characters you can help me out a little bit.

[01:56:19] Speaker 5: (coughs)

[01:56:21] Speaker 1: Not necessarily role play, just in combat.

[01:56:22] Speaker 2: Yeah, sure.

[01:56:24] Speaker 1: Um, any preference?

[01:56:25] Speaker 2: Boh.

[01:56:26] Speaker 1: Boh? Uh, okay.

[01:56:28] Speaker 2: I'm already doing...

[01:56:31] Speaker 5: Uh, I'll take Grimnar.

[01:56:32] Speaker 2: Aelish or-

[01:56:33] Speaker 1: Oh, he wanted the Boh one.

[01:56:35] Speaker 2: Oh, that's the one. Oh yeah, I'll take Aelish then.

[01:56:38] Speaker 1: You know, I've just found these guys is really, really simple. They're not really... They're s- basically off of a class. So basically just have their stats, a few roles, and they have kind of their logic what they would do.

[01:56:47] Speaker 2: Yeah.

[01:56:49] Speaker 1: Just to make it easy to play.

[01:56:50] Speaker 2: Brilliant.

[01:56:50] Speaker 1: I didn't want these to be spending half an hour trying to read the Pathfinder II class sheets.

[01:56:57] Speaker 2: Nine.

[01:56:59] Speaker 1: (coughs) So you guys are taking on a little ways further. Um, and eventually you-

[01:57:04] Speaker 3: What exactly we're doing here?

[01:57:08] Speaker 2: Save the Dryad.

[01:57:09] Speaker 4: Yep.

[01:57:10] Speaker 3: Of what?

[01:57:11] Speaker 2: Spiders.

[01:57:11] Speaker 4: Spiders.

[01:57:14] Speaker 5: Kotars, if you haven't noticed, um, man of few words.

[01:57:21] Speaker 3: Why is that?

[01:57:21] Speaker 5: Why he's a third and fourth word one? Two is enough.

[01:57:24] Speaker 3: Why is that?

[01:57:26] Speaker 5: You don't have to ask him.

[01:57:26] Speaker 3: (laughs) I am asking.

[01:57:28] Speaker 5: Well, he didn't say he was a man of few words.

[01:57:30] Speaker 3: Oh, no.

[01:57:30] Speaker 5: I was just telling you out of character.

[01:57:33] Speaker 3: Oh, okay.

[01:57:34] Speaker 5: You may have noticed that he does not use... He does not speak a lot and definitely does not speak in those Wilkenstien.

[01:57:40] Speaker 2: Is the AC with mystic armor, right?

[01:57:41] Speaker 4: It's okay. Um, yeah-

[01:57:44] Speaker 5: I don't care about all.

[01:57:44] Speaker 3: Okay.

[01:57:44] Speaker 1: She de- and then it's ... The video comes in. It's kind of a... She's too much of a chicken to uh-

[01:57:49] Speaker 3: Ulric's fine with that.

[01:57:50] Speaker 1: Not have that cast. So it's one of the first things she'll always do.

[01:57:53] Speaker 2: Yeah, it lasts until the next day.

[01:57:55] Speaker 1: Yeah. Um, you still-

[01:57:59] Speaker 3: I'm next opponent for fun.

[01:58:01] Speaker 4: Oh, she's a little bitch.

[01:58:03] Speaker 1: She's a little temperamental. You guys haven't caught a sense of her personality yet but...

[01:58:05] Speaker 2: Fuck. I think runic weapon lasts for like... What's that runic last? Oh, it's really short.

[01:58:14] Speaker 5: Minute?

[01:58:15] Speaker 2: Yeah, maybe it's the runic armor that lasts.

[01:58:18] Speaker 5: I mean there's probably like a heightened version that makes it last longer. With a lot of those buffs.

[01:58:24] Speaker 2: Yep.

[01:58:24] Speaker 5: They, they get better at higher level.

[01:58:28] Speaker 2: Nope, doesn't.

[01:58:30] Speaker 5: Mm.

[01:58:31] Speaker 2: There are other spells that give the uh-

[01:58:32] Speaker 5: Oh, okay.

[01:58:33] Speaker 2: ... similar abilities at higher levels.

[01:58:36] Speaker 1: So you guys are approaching a glade coming up in the distance here. Um...

[01:58:41] Speaker 2: Let me put all that stuff around.

[01:58:49] Speaker 1: And you see an opening as you guys are coming this direction. You see an opening coming from you, but you're starting to see a lot of spiderwebs.

[01:58:58] Speaker 2: I think we found the problem.

[01:59:01] Speaker 3: Hold on.

[01:59:01] Speaker 2: Actually it's a little further.

[01:59:03] Speaker 3: This is obviously traps. We better check it out.

[01:59:07] Speaker 5: Oh, this is where we must go. This is where, um... I'm gonna call her Glinda or Glina. Let's call her Glinda 'cause I, I just saw that movie. Looks like that.

[01:59:19] Speaker 3: All these spiderwebs we should burn it all down.

[01:59:22] Speaker 1: So we should see-

[01:59:22] Speaker 3: Make sure that there's no spiders there.

[01:59:23] Speaker 1: There's a lot of trees but into it you can still kind of see... A creature looks kind of like that.

[01:59:28] Speaker 3: Mm.

[01:59:28] Speaker 1: That is, um... There's a bunch of spiderwebs that are kind of keeping her in place actually. We'll move her in between these two. So, there's like two posts and she's been, like tied up kind of in there. So you guys are approaching, you do see...

[01:59:52] Speaker 3: Why like a lot of spiderwebs, like unless spiderwebs too, like impede us or just like annoy us as we walk through?

[01:59:58] Speaker 1: Um, the denser ones but um-

[02:00:01] Speaker 2: You can see a little spider. One or two little spiders that are crawling in the air.

[02:00:08] Speaker 1: Um, you can probably... They won't impede your movement. I mean the stuff, the stuff where she's in is pretty thick that wood but unless you're gonna crawl in between there. So, um, with that you guys have anything you want to do otherwise you can roll initiative as you guys are just at the edge of the map and decide. From there you can decide how you guys want to enter in.

[02:00:32] Speaker 2: It's always gonna fall over and...

[02:00:36] Speaker 3: Wow, you guys don't like you tonight.

[02:00:38] Speaker 2: Mm, I don't like her more. (laughs)

[02:00:41] Speaker 3: Well, mine was much better.

[02:00:43] Speaker 5: It's fine.

[02:00:45] Speaker 3: Did you roll for your Grimnar, Kai? And your Aelish? Do you, do you guys need to roll for them too?

[02:00:50] Speaker 2: Yeah, I already did.

[02:00:51] Speaker 4: Oh, I didn't roll for him. Uh, uh, Ulric.

[02:00:58] Speaker 3: Mine is, uh, 10.

[02:01:01] Speaker 1: Okay.

[02:01:03] Speaker 6: Uh, Kotal.

[02:01:05] Speaker 7: Five.

[02:01:07] Speaker 6: Krimnar.

[02:01:09] Speaker 8: 13.

[02:01:12] Speaker 1: I do see that there's some of those little vine guys you fought earlier, but they seem to be-

[02:01:17] Speaker 6: Could you hand me that leg real quick?

[02:01:17] Speaker 1: ... tangled up in the webs.

[02:01:19] Speaker 7: Where is it?

[02:01:21] Speaker 6: Uh, underneath the, that leg.

[02:01:25] Speaker 7: Oh, I see. Okay.

[02:01:32] Speaker 8: Okay. So-

[02:01:33] Speaker 7: Is this yours or is this mine?

[02:01:34] Speaker 8: Not mine. I don't think. No, not mine.

[02:01:40] Speaker 6: Hm. What's that look like? Is that one of... Hm. I don't know if that's mine or not.

[02:01:45] Speaker 7: My D10s are all-

[02:01:46] Speaker 8: Let's see.

[02:01:46] Speaker 7: ... sort of, like, mixed yellow-purple.

[02:01:49] Speaker 1: So red one has a nine. Red two has a six.

[02:01:58] Speaker 9: Sorry, uh, what'd you say?

[02:01:58] Speaker 1: Uh, red one it had nine, red two had a six.

[02:01:59] Speaker 9: Huh, red one, nine, red two, six.

[02:02:11] Speaker 8: It's two hours. Oh yeah, have I handed out another... Oh. Oh, 55. Where did I go here?

[02:02:19] Speaker 9: I think I'm the only one that used it, so.

[02:02:21] Speaker 6: Oh, yeah. If you're out. I saw you. I've got mine. There you go.

[02:02:24] Speaker 9: Well, now that we know what we can do with resolve points, spend them if you got them.

[02:02:27] Speaker 7: Yeah.

[02:02:28] Speaker 6: Mm.

[02:02:29] Speaker 7: Maybe. That's pretty handy.

[02:02:32] Speaker 6: Yeah. Uh, are... Did you roll for the greens?

[02:02:39] Speaker 1: Um, they haven't entered into initiative. They're tangled up in webs.

[02:02:41] Speaker 6: Okay.

[02:02:42] Speaker 1: You think if you cut them out of the web somehow or they break free, then they might be entering into initiative. On whose side, no one knows.

[02:02:49] Speaker 9: Who knows?

[02:02:54] Speaker 6: Who's first?

[02:02:55] Speaker 9: Uh, sorry. First is Krimnar. On deck is, I guess, Ulric and Braldan Tide. I don't know if you have a preference.

[02:03:09] Speaker 8: Not really.

[02:03:09] Speaker 9: Well. I'll let you go first since it's alphabetical, put you that way.

[02:03:15] Speaker 8: All right. Um, Krimnar will move forward five squares. Straight, whichever one is Krimnar.

[02:03:26] Speaker 9: Which one's Krimnar? There.

[02:03:27] Speaker 8: Oh. I didn't realize he was in line with a post. He will slide over one so he's not in line with a post.

[02:03:34] Speaker 9: (laughs) Fair. Kinda wasn't.

[02:03:38] Speaker 8: One, two, three, four, five, six. One, two, three, four. How far are the posts? What is my straight line distance?

[02:03:48] Speaker 1: Mm. If you wanna get into trigonometry there, about, I'd say 20 feet, we'll say.

[02:03:52] Speaker 8: No. How far is my straight line distance?

[02:03:54] Speaker 9: Oh, yeah.

[02:03:55] Speaker 8: On the... on the ground it's 45 feet.

[02:03:56] Speaker 6: It's 30. It's bridging.

[02:03:58] Speaker 8: Is it 60?

[02:03:59] Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll say it's 60 just to keep things simple.

[02:04:01] Speaker 8: All right. Then he will, um, rapid shot on number one, red one.

[02:04:12] Speaker 1: Krimnar?

[02:04:13] Speaker 8: Yep. Wow. 25.

[02:04:18] Speaker 9: How are you doing range attacks? Oh, wait, that's bow guy.

[02:04:22] Speaker 8: Who?

[02:04:22] Speaker 9: Oh. Yeah. Bow guy's goes home.

[02:04:24] Speaker 8: No.

[02:04:25] Speaker 7: I don't see him as a bow guy.

[02:04:28] Speaker 1: I didn't do the miniature that way, but I brought up the-

[02:04:31] Speaker 7: Oh, yeah. I'm just saying it's like, that's not the impression I got from him was a bow guy.

[02:04:34] Speaker 6: Yeah.

[02:04:34] Speaker 1: He might get tinkered with because I had to... I, I literally drew him up like 20 minutes before the session.

[02:04:39] Speaker 6: Mm-hmm.

[02:04:39] Speaker 1: I knew he was gonna be, but I hadn't drawn up his stats, so.

[02:04:42] Speaker 7: I mean, that's fine. He doesn't-

[02:04:43] Speaker 1: Um, I figured you guys were... The problem is there were so many melee in the party, it's like, I don't know if I can have another NPC that's gonna be a melee part guy, so. Decided to make him more of a hunter guy. Um, what did you say you rolled?

[02:04:53] Speaker 8: 25.

[02:04:54] Speaker 1: Uh, that'll hit either way, even with a range increment.

[02:04:56] Speaker 8: Okay. Um, that was, uh, five points of piercing.

[02:05:01] Speaker 7: Who's he attacking too? One-

[02:05:02] Speaker 8: Number one. It's only one in range. Uh, 13.

[02:05:06] Speaker 1: Goodness.

[02:05:08] Speaker 8: Um, I think he'll just stay there. He can't intimidate spiders. Uh, he's done.

[02:05:19] Speaker 1: Ulric.

[02:05:20] Speaker 7: If it's not written on there, he does have intimidating glare.

[02:05:22] Speaker 8: Okay. Well, then he's-

[02:05:23] Speaker 7: He's out of range.

[02:05:23] Speaker 8: He'll... Oh, it's 30 foot range. Uh, he's still gonna wait. Um, all... or, uh, uh, Kotal. Or, who's far? Kotal or Ulric?

[02:05:32] Speaker 7: Ulric.

[02:05:32] Speaker 8: Ulric. Who did you say?

[02:05:34] Speaker 7: Ulric.

[02:05:35] Speaker 8: Okay. Yeah. So down at the end.

[02:05:37] Speaker 9: Yeah. Kotal's... Yeah, end of the order.

[02:05:40] Speaker 8: (laughs) Oh yeah. 5.

[02:05:40] Speaker 6: He's gonna drop his shield.

[02:05:43] Speaker 7: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

[02:05:48] Speaker 9: What are you gonna do? You gonna attack me if I let you go? You little fucker.

[02:05:52] Speaker 1: I think he, um, is just spurring about in its web.

[02:05:57] Speaker 9: I can't do anything anyway, so-

[02:05:58] Speaker 1: All right.

[02:05:58] Speaker 9: ... I'm just gonna look at him. Oh, that's it for you?

[02:06:02] Speaker 7: Yep.

[02:06:03] Speaker 9: Okay. Uh, me. Uh, we're the ones on deck, by the way. It's, uh, all the way up there, I'm down here. 5, 10, 15, 20. 5, 15, 20. And take cover, is that an action?

[02:06:26] Speaker 8: It is.

[02:06:27] Speaker 9: Sweet. I know how to play.

[02:06:28] Speaker 7: (laughs)

[02:06:29] Speaker 9: Um, I'll take cover.

[02:06:30] Speaker 8: It increases your cover by one. So if you had lesser you get standard-

[02:06:34] Speaker 7: You get half less?

[02:06:35] Speaker 8: No. It increases your amount of c- cover is either +1, +2 or +5. Plus one probably for standing behind a thing. So you went from plus one to plus two.

[02:06:45] Speaker 7: Okay.

[02:06:46] Speaker 9: Cool.

[02:06:46] Speaker 8: Standard cover is what it is probably called in Hero Lab if you really want to add it.

[02:06:50] Speaker 9: I don't. Um, so that's my turn. Next is Radwin. Ailish is on deck.

[02:06:57] Speaker 1: Oh, that's me.

[02:06:58] Speaker 9: Radwin just climbs down and disappears behind some webs.

[02:07:01] Speaker 7: Copycat.

[02:07:03] Speaker 8: Oh, yeah. For the record.Standard cover also increases your reflexes.

[02:07:08] Speaker 9: Oh.

[02:07:08] Speaker 8: I forgot. It's close to the AC and reflex. Re- lesser cover is just plus one AC. Lesser cover's like standing behind a person.

[02:07:14] Speaker 9: (tapping sounds) Oh, what? Oh, okay. Her speed is on.

[02:07:18] Speaker 1: Wow, she's a fast fucker.

[02:07:19] Speaker 9: Okay, um, that was all from-

[02:07:21] Speaker 1: You mean on London? (laughs)

[02:07:21] Speaker 8: Yeah.

[02:07:22] Speaker 1: Um-

[02:07:22] Speaker 8: I'll just get speed.

[02:07:24] Speaker 9: Red Two is on deck. Uh, so five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30. I will take cover and cast glass shield to give myself one armor.

[02:07:37] Speaker 1: Oh, he'll probably use her. I think she first has to cast the mystic armor.

[02:07:41] Speaker 9: Oh, that does protect him.

[02:07:42] Speaker 1: Is that what that is?

[02:07:43] Speaker 9: Well, yeah, but it lasts until, like, the end of the day.

[02:07:46] Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

[02:07:46] Speaker 9: So I figure she just did that way before.

[02:07:48] Speaker 1: So she... Oh, yeah. That's true. Did it when she woke up as well.

[02:07:51] Speaker 9: Mm-hmm.

[02:07:52] Speaker 1: Um, (clicking sound) I didn't put her reaction on the sheet there.

[02:07:55] Speaker 9: That's the new version of age armor.

[02:07:58] Speaker 8: Yeah.

[02:07:58] Speaker 1: Um, she has an item too. Um, (tapping sound) thorn cloak. So, if he ever gets hit, if she gets hit, she can make a...

[02:08:06] Speaker 9: Oh, she has a reaction thing?

[02:08:07] Speaker 1: She has a reaction, yeah. If she's, if she's hit by a melee attack. Yeah.

[02:08:11] Speaker 9: I'll add it in.

[02:08:11] Speaker 1: I forgot. I... So if that comes up, let me know and I'll look up the stats. Yeah.

[02:08:14] Speaker 9: Yeah, I'm looking up the thing in Hero Lab so I can just remember.

[02:08:18] Speaker 1: Um, but yeah-

[02:08:19] Speaker 9: I think it's called Cloak of Thorns.

[02:08:20] Speaker 1: Red Two then calls Hal's on deck. Red Two also climbs down and disappears. Fuckers.

[02:08:28] Speaker 9: Cloak of gnawing leaves? Is that it?

[02:08:30] Speaker 1: Yeah, that might be it.

[02:08:32] Speaker 8: My turn?

[02:08:33] Speaker 9: One way or those characters had it. It's fun fluff.

[02:08:35] Speaker 1: Yeah, it's your turn.

[02:08:36] Speaker 9: Yeah, it's a reaction type thing. The item three, so she makes up for it, half it.

[02:08:45] Speaker 1: Into this row.

[02:08:47] Speaker 9: You couldn't have. Oh, you. Over here. One more. Yeah.

[02:08:53] Speaker 1: And ready. Uh, sorry.

[02:08:58] Speaker 9: All right. And then we don't get to the top of the round.

[02:09:00] Speaker 1: That's top of the round.

[02:09:02] Speaker 9: Oh, right there? Okay. Or he was the top of the round?

[02:09:05] Speaker 1: No, I was the bottom.

[02:09:05] Speaker 9: He was the bottom. Okay.

[02:09:06] Speaker 8: Grenada's on deck after, whatever happens.

[02:09:09] Speaker 1: Um, uh, no. We go right to the next round eight.

[02:09:16] Speaker 8: Yeah. Grenada, all right's on deck.

[02:09:21] Speaker 1: Um, there's nobody visible?

[02:09:23] Speaker 9: Mm, no. Except, except these guys and...

[02:09:26] Speaker 8: Yeah. (instrumental music plays) He will ready a rapid shot if one of those... If a, if a spider appears within 60 feet. He really has nothing else to do. And I don't think he wants to engage, get into melee range, so he's gonna stay there. Maybe he'll center himself a little bit since he's got plenty of action.

[02:09:51] Speaker 9: Okay, hold on.

[02:09:52] Speaker 1: Put him in with the... Yeah, right there. That way he's got good visibility on something popping out. Okay. Who's up next?

[02:10:02] Speaker 9: Or, oh. A fruit ball and smitey. Now, I smack you on your back and you now have runic weapon.

[02:10:08] Speaker 8: Oh, cool.

[02:10:09] Speaker 9: What's that?

[02:10:10] Speaker 8: Uh, makes your weapon plus one striking.

[02:10:12] Speaker 9: Holy shit. Yeah.

[02:10:14] Speaker 8: You should just add it as a spell adjustment. I think it's in there. And then you don't have to mess with your weapon. Yeah. If you had runic weapon.

[02:10:24] Speaker 9: Yeah, I see it now.

[02:10:24] Speaker 8: It'll magic it, it'll update your weapon attacks and damages for you.

[02:10:31] Speaker 9: Lasts for a minute.

[02:10:33] Speaker 8: It lasts for-

[02:10:34] Speaker 9: That will last a while.

[02:10:35] Speaker 8: Hopefully, the combat. And that's great.

[02:10:37] Speaker 9: Yeah. And then I will try to free the thing in front of me and... No, actually I'm going to try to-

[02:10:43] Speaker 1: Oh, yeah. By the way, two of you guys there, well, we'll get to you in a second.

[02:10:47] Speaker 9: I am actually going to try to get a sense of what his-

[02:10:50] Speaker 8: Sense motive.

[02:10:51] Speaker 9: Yeah. Sense his attitude towards me.

[02:10:55] Speaker 8: It's perception. It's just a roll for sense motive. And it is against.

[02:11:04] Speaker 9: Ooh, 17.

[02:11:04] Speaker 8: Deception, deception DC.

[02:11:08] Speaker 9: I think. (laughs)

[02:11:13] Speaker 8: Double check. We never really used it in the last campaign.

[02:11:17] Speaker 9: Nope.

[02:11:23] Speaker 8: It's on, it's on the cheat sheet somewhere.

[02:11:25] Speaker 9: Yeah, it's perception. Perception.

[02:11:27] Speaker 8: But what was it against?

[02:11:28] Speaker 9: (coughs) I don't know if that's on here.

[02:11:31] Speaker 8: It usually says.

[02:11:34] Speaker 9: Um, it's the bottom over there. I rolled a 19.

[02:11:40] Speaker 8: (laughs)

[02:11:40] Speaker 9: Nothing less you wanted to do with secrets.

[02:11:42] Speaker 8: Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah. It's not. Whatever DC you want it to be.

[02:11:50] Speaker 9: Yeah. Um, I'll give it to you 'cause it's pretty obvious. These things are kind of mindless. But right now, it's clawing out at you. You seem to think that it's looking to attack almost anything that's not the well lady. Uh, not the well lady.

[02:12:02] Speaker 1: How do you think that maybe there are ways of, um, either A, you speak Sylvan, or know someone who can? It's definitely not me.

[02:12:12] Speaker 8: Okay.

[02:12:12] Speaker 1: Glances meaningfully at the elf.

[02:12:15] Speaker 9: Uh, I'm sure she doesn't speak it.

[02:12:17] Speaker 1: (laughs) You also coincidentally have two small fey that are hovering, peering behind trees. Oh. One, two, three, four, five, 10, 15, 20. And then the, um, you and Bjorn or, uh, Grimgar, if you guys wanna take a... That thing does have that odor.

[02:12:40] Speaker 9: Oh, oh.

[02:12:41] Speaker 1: That affects everyone, so if you want to...

[02:12:43] Speaker 9: Oh, shit. I forgot about that. Yeah. What's the range?

[02:12:45] Speaker 1: What's the range? 10 feet. So it's not even just the two of you.

[02:12:49] Speaker 9: The, there's three people.

[02:12:51] Speaker 1: She'd be right... You know when she's behind someone?

[02:12:52] Speaker 9: There's another mini behind the pole.

[02:12:54] Speaker 1: I'd say in her case, probably no.

[02:12:56] Speaker 9: Okay. What is it? Is it at 14?

[02:12:58] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[02:12:59] Speaker 9: Okay, I make it.

[02:13:00] Speaker 1: 15?

[02:13:01] Speaker 9: What's the DC?

[02:13:03] Speaker 1: 14.

[02:13:04] Speaker 9: Oh. 18 plus stuff.

[02:13:05] Speaker 1: Oh, yeah. They just flatfoot it this round.I got a weak ass next run, if you're still on that.

[02:13:11] Speaker 8: (coughs)

[02:13:13] Speaker 9: Okay. Um, so (tapping) 5, 10, 15, 20. And then I'll do that two move and attack thing. So 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30. Is that... Do I see him there? Do I get stuck in the abs?

[02:13:29] Speaker 1: Yeah, once you... So you basically there, once you get to here, you'd see him. It is rearing up like it's gonna... I think I'm gonna destroy my own miniature. Um, it's right there. I'm gonna put a small shrub there for now, for sight reasons. It was rearing up and hissing. So once you get to there, it would have a ready action-

[02:13:48] Speaker 8: Yeah.

[02:13:49] Speaker 1: ... to attack but you can also smack it.

[02:13:51] Speaker 9: Yeah.

[02:13:52] Speaker 1: Um-

[02:13:52] Speaker 8: I mean, I'll still move up there.

[02:13:54] Speaker 1: It can-

[02:13:54] Speaker 8: The one for-

[02:13:54] Speaker 1: ... theoretically attack me.

[02:13:55] Speaker 8: Sure, of course but...

[02:13:57] Speaker 1: Well, when you're with, um, the type of opportunity that uses up your reaction so even if it did have reactive strike, it still couldn't do it. You can only get one reaction.

[02:14:05] Speaker 8: Yeah.

[02:14:05] Speaker 1: Ready, ready to use up your action.

[02:14:08] Speaker 9: Okay. Um, ba-dum bum-bum. (laughs) Meleer he has some sharp fangs. Uh-oh.

[02:14:16] Speaker 8: Good.

[02:14:16] Speaker 9: Uh, let's use this dice. Well, he pulls out his, uh, uh, dagger and tries to stab at you. Uh, minute-

[02:14:25] Speaker 8: A spider...

[02:14:25] Speaker 1: (laughs)

[02:14:25] Speaker 8: ... a spider pulls out a dagger?

[02:14:27] Speaker 1: (laughs) Yeah.

[02:14:27] Speaker 8: He's carrying a piece.

[02:14:28] Speaker 9: Holy shit.

[02:14:28] Speaker 1: Um-

[02:14:29] Speaker 9: Some Dark Souls bullshit.

[02:14:30] Speaker 8: (laughs)

[02:14:31] Speaker 1: That would be a 20 to hit.

[02:14:34] Speaker 9: Yeah, that hits.

[02:14:36] Speaker 1: For one point of damage.

[02:14:38] Speaker 9: Ow.

[02:14:39] Speaker 1: They have a D6 but minus two plus two.

[02:14:42] Speaker 9: Hm. Okay, well, uh, I will make my attack for all on that one. Um, does a 17 hit?

[02:14:55] Speaker 1: Uh, it does.

[02:14:56] Speaker 9: Sweet.

[02:14:57] Speaker 1: And you're going to number two.

[02:15:02] Speaker 9: Mm-hmm. Uh, so 20 bludgeoning and three spirit.

[02:15:06] Speaker 1: Wow. This is wow.

[02:15:07] Speaker 9: Yeah.

[02:15:09] Speaker 1: Striking.

[02:15:10] Speaker 9: Conan the Barbarian.

[02:15:11] Speaker 8: I think I've seen it. And that was your reaction last time, he told me that. It's your favorite movie or something like that.

[02:15:20] Speaker 9: I won't say it's my favorite movie but I mean-

[02:15:21] Speaker 8: 100%.

[02:15:21] Speaker 9: It's like, it's like playing games like this-

[02:15:25] Speaker 8: Oh, go on. Yeah.

[02:15:25] Speaker 9: ... and not seeing Conan the Barbarian-

[02:15:27] Speaker 10: (laughs)

[02:15:27] Speaker 9: ... it's like the ultimate like D&D movie.

[02:15:30] Speaker 1: Holy crap. It's dead?

[02:15:32] Speaker 9: (laughs) Yeah.

[02:15:34] Speaker 1: This is a weird addition.

[02:15:36] Speaker 9: I mean, I rolled Max Damage on one of the guys, so.

[02:15:38] Speaker 1: Like the, the, the, by, the bites you fight had 30 hit points. Any guess what the, how many points these guys have?

[02:15:43] Speaker 8: They're spiders and I assumed that there was a shit-ton of them, not just two. So I would have guessed five, seven.

[02:15:48] Speaker 1: Six.

[02:15:49] Speaker 8: Ah.

[02:15:50] Speaker 9: Wow.

[02:15:50] Speaker 8: 'Cause they're... I... It seems like this-

[02:15:52] Speaker 1: This is a-

[02:15:52] Speaker 8: ... is going to overwhelm you, not-

[02:15:54] Speaker 1: Well, actually-

[02:15:55] Speaker 9: Six?

[02:15:55] Speaker 8: ... I mean I'm going through and-

[02:15:56] Speaker 9: Geez.

[02:15:56] Speaker 8: ... cure lab and drawing them up and making sure-

[02:15:59] Speaker 1: This is a-

[02:15:59] Speaker 8: ... they are appropriately leveled.

[02:16:01] Speaker 1: (laughs) Yeah but they're... there's not a super swarm of them either. That's kind of strange. I didn't expect it though.

[02:16:07] Speaker 8: Mm-hmm. Nice.

[02:16:08] Speaker 9: Nice job, Verona.

[02:16:09] Speaker 10: (laughs)

[02:16:10] Speaker 9: And, uh, that's my turn. Red One's on deck. Or Red One's turn.

[02:16:15] Speaker 1: Red One, Red One er-

[02:16:17] Speaker 9: I think we got two off 'cause yeah.

[02:16:19] Speaker 1: And when are we at the top of the order? Give me a reminder when, once we get there.

[02:16:22] Speaker 9: Ah, yeah, that's Grimnar's turn, so we're away.

[02:16:24] Speaker 1: Oh. Um, he would skitter over behind her.

[02:16:28] Speaker 8: For no particular reason, he wants to know the top of the order and this is an appropriately difficult encounter-

[02:16:33] Speaker 1: (laughs)

[02:16:33] Speaker 8: ... with only two monsters, no.

[02:16:35] Speaker 9: Yeah. (laughs) You know, they gave us a plus one striking-

[02:16:37] Speaker 10: Oh, sure.

[02:16:37] Speaker 9: ... weapon for no reason at all.

[02:16:39] Speaker 8: Oh, I'm sure there's nothing else here.

[02:16:41] Speaker 1: Um, that's only a 10.

[02:16:43] Speaker 9: Yeah.

[02:16:43] Speaker 1: We'll take another bite or no wait.

[02:16:46] Speaker 9: And like added like four members to our party.

[02:16:50] Speaker 1: Well...

[02:16:50] Speaker 9: (laughs)

[02:16:51] Speaker 10: (laughs)

[02:16:52] Speaker 1: It's going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience.

[02:16:55] Speaker 9: Yeah.

[02:16:56] Speaker 8: These are just the baby spiders. (laughs)

[02:17:00] Speaker 10: (laughs)

[02:17:00] Speaker 9: What do you think about that?

[02:17:02] Speaker 10: Wait 'til it pulls out the she-lab.

[02:17:03] Speaker 1: Well, actually first thing we do try to spit ve- um, a web at you which would miss horribly then it would move up and try to bite you.

[02:17:09] Speaker 9: Okay.

[02:17:09] Speaker 1: So the web was the first one that missed horribly, the bite isn't much better it's only a 13.

[02:17:15] Speaker 9: What do you think about spell casters-

[02:17:16] Speaker 1: That's a crit.

[02:17:16] Speaker 9: ... not having any spells at lower levels?

[02:17:18] Speaker 10: Um, I ask for no particular reason but I never did get full healed but I did get treat wounds. Does that still remove wounded?

[02:17:24] Speaker 8: Treat wounds removes wounded.

[02:17:25] Speaker 9: Yep.

[02:17:26] Speaker 8: No matter how much it heals. To remove wounded with healing, you have to be healed to full.

[02:17:30] Speaker 9: Yeah, yeah. Um, so next stop is Ailish. Kotal is on deck. Oh, I'm Ailish, ah. Okay, she's a speedy fucker, right?

[02:17:40] Speaker 10: Yep.

[02:17:41] Speaker 9: Uh, okay. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35.

[02:17:47] Speaker 11: So, I guess that'll force the habit in. We actually wait long enough to-

[02:17:50] Speaker 1: Now if you look, there is a ton of webs that are holding her.

[02:17:52] Speaker 9: ... uh, kill the way? Yeah.

[02:17:52] Speaker 1: So she'd have a hard time going through that.

[02:17:53] Speaker 8: Even if you didn't

[02:17:53] Speaker 12: Oh, no.

[02:17:55] Speaker 10: (laughs) I was gonna say 'cause I, I just saw in the background-

[02:17:57] Speaker 9: Can I try and like (air whoosh) ... think about it, take the webs off her?

[02:18:00] Speaker 1: Yeah, she could do that.

[02:18:01] Speaker 9: Mm-hmm.

[02:18:01] Speaker 1: Um, she could just spin around and... or if she, if she, was that one action you thought or two?

[02:18:06] Speaker 9: I think it would be, uh, let me double check. Uh, well, when would difficult terrain start?

[02:18:12] Speaker 1: Um, Ailish is generally free. You can move through most of the webs that are here.

[02:18:16] Speaker 9: Oh, then you-

[02:18:17] Speaker 1: But with her, she's kind of tied up between the two poles.

[02:18:20] Speaker 9: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35. Oh, I'm see- so you're just saying it would be hard to get through here.

[02:18:25] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[02:18:26] Speaker 9: Uh, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35. Okay, so she got here in one action, um, 5, 10, 15 and-

[02:18:35] Speaker 10: That's a trap.

[02:18:35] Speaker 1: She could spend some time-

[02:18:37] Speaker 9: Yeah, if she could spend an action getting rid of those webs.

[02:18:39] Speaker 10: You should burn 'em.

[02:18:40] Speaker 1: She thinks if she spent two more actions, like one more action kind of in front and one action from the side, um, she could clear her entirely. So she has one but as she's clearing this web right here-

[02:18:52] Speaker 9: Mm-hmm.

[02:18:52] Speaker 1: ... a creature would enter into initiative-

[02:18:54] Speaker 11: Hold on. Hold on.

[02:18:54] Speaker 1: ... and it can't really step after her.

[02:18:56] Speaker 9: Okay. Kotal is still on deck before the top of the round, as far as we're... oh.

[02:19:00] Speaker 8: How does she look?

[02:19:01] Speaker 1: So a little spider, this looks like a skull, jumps out of the tree at her.

[02:19:06] Speaker 9: All right. (laughs)

[02:19:10] Speaker 1: So, you can just put, um, skull spider in a, initiative that follows hers.

[02:19:16] Speaker 13: Okay.

[02:19:16] Speaker 1: Um, so one action to hop down at her. (instrumental music) Actually, the first thing it will do is spit a web at her, and then it will try to jump on her and bite her. So the web first. It's only an 11.

[02:19:33] Speaker 13: It misses.

[02:19:34] Speaker 1: Um, then he would try to hop down and bite her anyways, which is not very good. He has 16.

[02:19:41] Speaker 13: Um, that just hits.

[02:19:43] Speaker 1: Okay. It does. Three points. Um... (instrumental music)

[02:19:51] Speaker 13: And this was a melee attack?

[02:19:53] Speaker 1: Yep.

[02:19:53] Speaker 13: Then I will use her cloak of the nod leaves. Um... (instrumental music)

[02:19:58] Speaker 1: I think it has to take a save again.

[02:20:00] Speaker 13: Yeah, DC17 reflex saving throw.

[02:20:02] Speaker 1: (three dice clatter) It fails.

[02:20:04] Speaker 13: Okay.

[02:20:05] Speaker 1: As a matter of fact, I think it's... Nope, it does not crit fail.

[02:20:10] Speaker 13: Okay. Yeah, apparently it takes wounding damage if it crit fails. (three dice clatter)

[02:20:15] Speaker 1: Um, but it still takes four piercing damage.

[02:20:17] Speaker 13: Oh.

[02:20:18] Speaker 1: Uh, it had six health, right?

[02:20:20] Speaker 13: God.

[02:20:20] Speaker 1: (laughs)

[02:20:21] Speaker 13: This one has more.

[02:20:23] Speaker 1: Oh.

[02:20:23] Speaker 13: So apparently it's different.

[02:20:24] Speaker 1: Skull, skull.

[02:20:25] Speaker 13: It's a different spider.

[02:20:27] Speaker 1: Um, so she then has a, take a fortitude saving throw-

[02:20:30] Speaker 13: Oh.

[02:20:30] Speaker 1: ... because they have injected her with some venom.

[02:20:32] Speaker 13: Shit. Okay. Oh, that's a nat 20, uh-

[02:20:36] Speaker 1: Oh.

[02:20:36] Speaker 13: ... plus... Yeah, 24.

[02:20:38] Speaker 1: Yeah, she's had spider venom for dinner. She's, uh, n- you know, no effect on her.

[02:20:42] Speaker 13: That is very rude of you. Is it okay to role play as her or is-

[02:20:46] Speaker 1: Oh, yeah. No, you can.

[02:20:47] Speaker 13: ... am I stepping on your toes?

[02:20:50] Speaker 1: Each character does have some kind of personality. I... They're not... It's not their personality, but it's usually when I try to talk with them. Have you guys ever played Borderlands?

[02:20:56] Speaker 13: No.

[02:20:57] Speaker 1: Okay. Well, we'll get that one reference then. Um, wait, I had two incidences with her. What was the other? (two dice clatter) Ah, it'll come to me.

[02:21:08] Speaker 13: I'm gonna smack you for that later.

[02:21:09] Speaker 1: (laughs)

[02:21:10] Speaker 13: And that's her turn and that skull spider's turn. Next is Kotal. And that will be at the end of their round.

[02:21:16] Speaker 8: Oh, one, two, three, four, five. I can get right in front of the bush with one diagonal move.

[02:21:24] Speaker 1: Right there?

[02:21:25] Speaker 8: Yeah. Is that close enough to reach the web or do I need to move one more that way?

[02:21:29] Speaker 1: Um, I'd say that if, you could effect... So there'll be... There's three elements of webs. There's this one, this one, and then one that's all on the-

[02:21:33] Speaker 8: No, I'm gonna take care of the one that's-

[02:21:35] Speaker 1: Where you're at.

[02:21:35] Speaker 8: ... right there with one action and my third action is to parry in case something jumps out at me too.

[02:21:40] Speaker 1: Okay. Two webs down. You then hear... You hear some weird screeching.

[02:21:49] Speaker 13: (rapid music) Yeah.

[02:21:50] Speaker 1: Coming out of the, uh, thing. And a creature kind of looks like this.

[02:21:55] Speaker 13: Ah.

[02:21:55] Speaker 8: Hello.

[02:21:56] Speaker 13: It's definitely not a-

[02:21:57] Speaker 1: Walks by.

[02:21:58] Speaker 13: ... spider.

[02:21:59] Speaker 1: The trees, so...

[02:22:00] Speaker 8: Mm-hmm.

[02:22:00] Speaker 1: It spoke and there's one action to get there.

[02:22:04] Speaker 14: What position is 12 again? Shh.

[02:22:06] Speaker 8: I can't remember off the top of my head.

[02:22:07] Speaker 14: Just out of the top of initiative?

[02:22:09] Speaker 8: Yeah. You haven't played Baldur's Gate 3 enough.

[02:22:12] Speaker 14: Oh, I know exactly what it is. It's just-

[02:22:13] Speaker 8: And then another creature will enter in on initiative.

[02:22:19] Speaker 14: Oh, I, I remember now. Yeah. This guy was in Baldur's Gate 3.

[02:22:23] Speaker 8: Um, yeah.

[02:22:24] Speaker 1: On initiative, it's between New Ground's, um, level that we're in.

[02:22:26] Speaker 8: Some of them were, I assume. It, it looks kind of like it, yeah. Maybe not. I can't tell.

[02:22:32] Speaker 1: Mm-hmm. It sees...

[02:22:34] Speaker 13: It's been too long since I've played it, I remember.

[02:22:36] Speaker 14: In the spider cavern.

[02:22:37] Speaker 1: Sees you messing with its web.

[02:22:38] Speaker 8: With the spiders?

[02:22:40] Speaker 1: I think it would-

[02:22:41] Speaker 13: Oh.

[02:22:41] Speaker 1: I think it's... Oh, yeah. Kind of angry against you. Since you just opened up that web.

[02:22:47] Speaker 8: It's, yeah, it's clear.

[02:22:48] Speaker 1: Conveniently just walked right up there. He's none too pleased you did with his handiwork.

[02:22:53] Speaker 13: Gremnar's on deck, by the way.

[02:22:56] Speaker 1: Um, just a minute, because I think he's gonna shoot a web at you first. Is that a reflex?

[02:23:03] Speaker 13: I've seen it. It just came out with another patch for it-

[02:23:05] Speaker 14: Yeah, I gotta see how that-

[02:23:05] Speaker 13: ... actually. Yeah, they added like a 200 or so classes.

[02:23:07] Speaker 8: It's on attack roll.

[02:23:09] Speaker 14: Like official ones.

[02:23:10] Speaker 8: Yep.

[02:23:10] Speaker 14: Even though they had like, patches but... Or like, mods, but now they're official.

[02:23:14] Speaker 8: Mm-hmm.

[02:23:15] Speaker 13: Yeah.

[02:23:16] Speaker 14: What? Baldur's Gate?

[02:23:17] Speaker 1: Yeah, he's gonna shoot a web at you first.

[02:23:18] Speaker 8: But they're the same mods, they're just now officially supported and there's a UI to add them from inside the game.

[02:23:23] Speaker 14: Oh.

[02:23:23] Speaker 1: Uh, 22 to hit.

[02:23:24] Speaker 8: Hit. (die clatters) Try to attack or the web?

[02:23:28] Speaker 13: Norian Studios is making a YouTube video of their Dark Urge play through.

[02:23:32] Speaker 14: Oh.

[02:23:32] Speaker 13: They're using like, the sexy Astarion mod, which just gives him like really pouty lips.

[02:23:36] Speaker 8: Oh, really?

[02:23:37] Speaker 13: Yeah.

[02:23:37] Speaker 8: Oh, Astarion, right. Yeah.

[02:23:38] Speaker 13: Nope. That's why they came along. I like it a lot.

[02:23:44] Speaker 8: I've done it like eight times. I think that can be done.

[02:23:46] Speaker 1: You are hit by-

[02:23:47] Speaker 8: I was tempted to play again with the Shadow Monk or whatever they added in.

[02:23:51] Speaker 1: With this one-

[02:23:51] Speaker 14: Yeah, all the new subclasses.

[02:23:52] Speaker 8: I am what?

[02:23:53] Speaker 1: So you are hit by a, by its web attack. You are immobilized and stuck to no surface until you succeed a acrobatics check.

[02:24:01] Speaker 13: I'm curious to see what the, oh, the modders do, like..........................

[02:24:04] Speaker 1: And then he's going to take an attack on you with his-

[02:24:06] Speaker 13: Like adventures that they make and stuff?

[02:24:08] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[02:24:08] Speaker 13: That's what I'm curious to see.

[02:24:10] Speaker 1: They... Like, they provided the modding tools for that kind of thing.

[02:24:11] Speaker 8: Yeah.

[02:24:12] Speaker 1: So.

[02:24:12] Speaker 8: He's gonna try to bite you with his fangs.

[02:24:14] Speaker 13: Exactly. I heard there was like a project to create Curse of Strahd in it.

[02:24:17] Speaker 8: Does Mobilize make me?

[02:24:17] Speaker 1: Watch, would you?

[02:24:18] Speaker 13: Awesome.

[02:24:18] Speaker 8: Sorry, does what say?

[02:24:19] Speaker 13: That psychotic dude just-

[02:24:21] Speaker 1: One of my favorite all time adventures. It's just a lot of fun.

[02:24:23] Speaker 8: Isn't immobilize the same as being, um...

[02:24:25] Speaker 13: Just 'cause you can't use any actions to like, move or-

[02:24:26] Speaker 8: I can play that, but almost like in every condition. (laughs)

[02:24:30] Speaker 1: Maybe I'm thinking about it a couple higher.

[02:24:31] Speaker 8: There's things about it.

[02:24:32] Speaker 13: Yeah, I think restrained. Just be careful.

[02:24:34] Speaker 1: Just as immobilized, so... Um, so you still need a 20.

[02:24:39] Speaker 13: The only nice thing about it is-

[02:24:41] Speaker 1: This will be his second attack, however-

[02:24:42] Speaker 13: Is Runes on this table?

[02:24:43] Speaker 1: And it is not gonna be a 20.

[02:24:44] Speaker 13: 'Cause it says Radmus, so it's not-

[02:24:45] Speaker 1: Try it.

[02:24:45] Speaker 13: ... exactly the same.

[02:24:46] Speaker 1: You're up... Well, I'm up. Grimnar.

[02:24:48] Speaker 13: Grimnar, yeah.

[02:24:48] Speaker 1: Grimnar sees this creature-

[02:24:50] Speaker 13: I just heard Strahd's a really fun villain, the way he interacts with the party.

[02:24:53] Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

[02:24:54] Speaker 8: Grimnar doesn't care.

[02:24:55] Speaker 13: He is.

[02:24:55] Speaker 8: He's... Well, he's going, uh... Can he move forward or is he gonna shoot? Since he already had an action to shoot, creatures that came within 60 feet.

[02:25:06] Speaker 1: With spiders. He's gonna move forward three.

[02:25:09] Speaker 13: Well, a spider could-

[02:25:12] Speaker 15: ... big glare on the scary looking thing.

[02:25:15] Speaker 16: The Bone Spidey would have attacked if opportunity had presented itself.

[02:25:17] Speaker 17: Yeah, that's Will?

[02:25:18] Speaker 15: Or as ready to action.

[02:25:19] Speaker 17: Ready to action?

[02:25:19] Speaker 15: I was... Yeah. That was like a round and a half ago.

[02:25:22] Speaker 17: Yeah, that's close. I haven't got since he showed up.

[02:25:24] Speaker 15: So that is, uh, against will DC?

[02:25:26] Speaker 17: Bone Spidey's on deck.

[02:25:26] Speaker 15: Oh, yeah.

[02:25:27] Speaker 17: It is not gonna succeed, uh, nine.

[02:25:30] Speaker 15: Oh.

[02:25:30] Speaker 17: Anything, unless you've got a negative one. (laughs)

[02:25:33] Speaker 18: (laughs)

[02:25:33] Speaker 15: A negative two plus 10, it'll still beat the nine. Um, and then he will, uh, rapid shot. Uh, two dice. That is a thir- it's 15. That would miss. That is a 18. That would hit. Three points of piercing. He has no bonuses. It's a shitty short sword.

[02:26:00] Speaker 18: Yeah, it's 'cause he sucks at all the roles. Yeah.

[02:26:01] Speaker 15: He needs a composite. Probably needs a composite. He didn't put attributes here.

[02:26:05] Speaker 18: Yeah.

[02:26:05] Speaker 15: I assume he's got a... He's got a plus one on damage on short swords, so he must have a plus one strength.

[02:26:10] Speaker 18: Well, I don't know what level he is, but I mean, there's also no striking on it, so...

[02:26:14] Speaker 15: Yeah, dodge him, pass.

[02:26:17] Speaker 18: All right, Ulric. All right. Burn it! You gotta burn it all! And Ulric pulls out a torch and starts strapping on to the end of his 10-foot pole and lighting it up, getting ready to charge.

[02:26:28] Speaker 17: Oh, burn the spriggan.

[02:26:31] Speaker 1: So that'd be two actions. You could still have a third action if you want. I'm gonna say one to withdraw it, one to attach it and then-

[02:26:36] Speaker 18: Okay. Well, then-

[02:26:36] Speaker 15: Uh, light the torch.

[02:26:37] Speaker 1: He'll light the other project for you.

[02:26:43] Speaker 18: Okay, good. My turn. Um, where are the webs? Damn kids.

[02:26:50] Speaker 9: Uh, one action to, uh... 15. Could I get here and-

[02:26:57] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[02:26:57] Speaker 9: ... and get off the webs?

[02:26:58] Speaker 1: Yeah, you can get there any percent with your third action. Or spend an action to get off your last webs.

[02:27:03] Speaker 9: Yeah.

[02:27:04] Speaker 18: What is the dryad doing? Oh, it's stuck in the web.

[02:27:07] Speaker 1: She's thrashing a little bit.

[02:27:08] Speaker 16: What is she like-

[02:27:09] Speaker 1: But now she's-

[02:27:09] Speaker 16: ... reacting or saying anything or doing anything?

[02:27:12] Speaker 1: She's, well, see now she can.

[02:27:13] Speaker 9: She seems conscious and is moving?

[02:27:14] Speaker 1: And at the end of the round might do stuff.

[02:27:15] Speaker 18: Yeah. I'm just wondering if, like, has she gone crazy?

[02:27:18] Speaker 16: But she's awake.

[02:27:19] Speaker 18: Is she gonna attack us?

[02:27:19] Speaker 1: Oh, yeah. She's awake. Um...

[02:27:22] Speaker 18: Has she been corrupted?

[02:27:23] Speaker 1: Um-

[02:27:24] Speaker 9: Let's find out.

[02:27:26] Speaker 1: When was... Try any knowledge checks. Yes.

[02:27:28] Speaker 9: I haven't had any spare actions.

[02:27:30] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[02:27:30] Speaker 9: And he doesn't have nature or anything appropriate.

[02:27:32] Speaker 1: Yeah, I didn't put those all in there.

[02:27:34] Speaker 9: He's got skills, but just not knowledge skills.

[02:27:35] Speaker 18: I can reach the ugly from here, right?

[02:27:37] Speaker 1: What's that?

[02:27:37] Speaker 18: I can reach the ugly guy from here, right?

[02:27:39] Speaker 1: Yep. And you have flank too.

[02:27:41] Speaker 18: Oh. Oh, look at that.

[02:27:43] Speaker 1: Well, I don't want that. (laughs)

[02:27:48] Speaker 18: Is that what you get, one?

[02:27:50] Speaker 9: No, I got a two, then I rolled again and I got a two.

[02:27:53] Speaker 1: Then you get to roll again.

[02:27:54] Speaker 18: Oh, yeah.

[02:27:54] Speaker 9: Because it's now a five. Yeah.

[02:27:55] Speaker 1: Use your hero point and it's five or below.

[02:27:57] Speaker 9: All right. Keep going until you get back into five or below.

[02:28:00] Speaker 18: That is a 19 to hit.

[02:28:01] Speaker 9: Yeah, it will hit.

[02:28:01] Speaker 18: Oh, that's better.

[02:28:05] Speaker 9: And you got flank too, so... Okay, um, so that is 22 bludgeoning and three spirits.

[02:28:13] Speaker 1: Wow. Wow.

[02:28:13] Speaker 9: Three spirits.

[02:28:13] Speaker 15: He's got plus one striking for this one.

[02:28:14] Speaker 9: 22 and three would be-

[02:28:15] Speaker 16: Yes.

[02:28:16] Speaker 18: Yeah, 25.

[02:28:17] Speaker 9: 25.

[02:28:18] Speaker 18: That's plus striking.

[02:28:19] Speaker 16: Yeah, it's a blow thing.

[02:28:22] Speaker 9: You got a new best friend here.

[02:28:23] Speaker 16: This is gonna be nice to this old man who likes to swear.

[02:28:26] Speaker 1: Ulric, my friends call me brah.

[02:28:28] Speaker 16: (laughs)

[02:28:28] Speaker 1: Call me brah. And that's my turn. Uh, Red One's turn. Is Red One still alive?

[02:28:34] Speaker 15: Yes.

[02:28:34] Speaker 9: Yep.

[02:28:34] Speaker 15: He's hiding behind the pole.

[02:28:36] Speaker 18: I keep thinking Star Wars when you hear a Red One.

[02:28:38] Speaker 1: He's gonna scurry over.

[02:28:39] Speaker 18: Yeah, so am I. (laughs)

[02:28:40] Speaker 16: Red Leader.

[02:28:41] Speaker 1: So he has you kind of flanking it and he is going to... I think he's just gonna go straight for an attack.

[02:28:46] Speaker 9: Yeah, that's fair.

[02:28:46] Speaker 15: Did you free the dryad on your turn?

[02:28:48] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[02:28:48] Speaker 15: Yep.

[02:28:48] Speaker 9: Okay.

[02:28:49] Speaker 16: (tapping) Oh, he will miss horribly on his attack even with flank. And his second attack he'll miss even more horribly than he did the first time.

[02:29:00] Speaker 9: Yay.

[02:29:04] Speaker 16: Um, so next up is Aelys, me, crap. Uh, Skull Spider's on deck. Aelys is gonna go for the Skull Spider. Um, so it'll do its, uh...

[02:29:16] Speaker 18: Sheath point.

[02:29:17] Speaker 16: Sheath, it'll do a thorn whip and that trippy thing. Um, so I think it has to, uh...

[02:29:24] Speaker 1: So you'll take, um, basically an athletics check versus its, uh...

[02:29:27] Speaker 18: Maybe I need to change weapons.

[02:29:27] Speaker 9: Oh, okay.

[02:29:28] Speaker 18: A trip is just the athletics versus its reflex DC.

[02:29:30] Speaker 9: Well, it doesn't... It's something else would fit my guy better, I think.

[02:29:34] Speaker 16: Uh, 13.

[02:29:38] Speaker 1: It's reflex? Oh, no. That one missed.

[02:29:43] Speaker 9: Okay. Whoa. Um, what else can she do? Are you looking okay?

[02:29:50] Speaker 15: Yeah.

[02:29:51] Speaker 9: I'm untouched.

[02:29:52] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[02:29:53] Speaker 9: You guys haven't really done much to me, guys.

[02:29:53] Speaker 15: I've been immobilized but I am not hurt.

[02:29:56] Speaker 9: All right. Um, I will just try and attack these

[02:29:59] Speaker 19: Well, if you have to move anywhere, it doesn't matter.

[02:30:01] Speaker 9: He doesn't like to be immobilized.

[02:30:02] Speaker 19: Okay, um, 15?

[02:30:05] Speaker 9: Um, that's a miss.

[02:30:07] Speaker 19: That's a miss. Okay.

[02:30:08] Speaker 17: Uh, third eye shield. Third eye shield.

[02:30:10] Speaker 9: Oh.

[02:30:10] Speaker 17: I got you.

[02:30:12] Speaker 9: Uh, who's that?

[02:30:13] Speaker 17: Oh, that's right, the Dream Spider.

[02:30:14] Speaker 9: Uh, the Skull Spider.

[02:30:16] Speaker 17: Skull slash Dream Spider.

[02:30:18] Speaker 16: (laughs) Dream Spider? What's a Dream Spider?

[02:30:22] Speaker 9: That's a knowledge check.

[02:30:23] Speaker 16: (laughs)

[02:30:26] Speaker 1: I gotta remember when I write, print out these sheets, I gotta rewrite the names if I'm reper- if I'm repurposing them. Um, yes, it's gonna go straight up and attack.

[02:30:34] Speaker 9: On whom?

[02:30:36] Speaker 1: Uh, Aelys.

[02:30:36] Speaker 18: Probably Aelys.

[02:30:39] Speaker 1: Well, it's gonna miss horribly. It'll attack again. This venom can be nasty if it hits.

[02:30:46] Speaker 15: Yeah, that's a good one.

[02:30:47] Speaker 1: Um, that would be an 18.

[02:30:48] Speaker 9: That would just hit.

[02:30:50] Speaker 1: Um, so it would... She'd take two points of damage.

[02:30:53] Speaker 9: And? Okay. That's all of her stamina.

[02:30:56] Speaker 15: Of course, yeah. Of course.

[02:30:56] Speaker 1: And then she has some venom, so 14.

[02:31:00] Speaker 9: Even if she already passed it before?

[02:31:01] Speaker 1: Yep. Yeah.

[02:31:02] Speaker 9: That's a two hit by Enugos.

[02:31:04] Speaker 15: That's a tell there, I think.

[02:31:05] Speaker 9: That's a two on the die, so... Yeah, that's, uh, six.

[02:31:09] Speaker 1: Um, let me see if it has...

[02:31:11] Speaker 9: Aelys should be hardly doing anything.

[02:31:14] Speaker 8: He's, uh-

[02:31:15] Speaker 1: So basically it's gonna go into stage two. So she is stupefied, one. I don't think that'll affect her any. And, um, she has poison damage.

[02:31:27] Speaker 3: Okay. How much poison?

[02:31:28] Speaker 1: Um, just DC for six resistance. So let's do it once for one round. Two points of poison damage.

[02:31:33] Speaker 3: Okay.

[02:31:33] Speaker 1: That's not that much. She, she took two points, not she has two points.

[02:31:38] Speaker 8: Yeah. And she has a cloak.

[02:31:42] Speaker 3: Oh, yeah, totally forgot about that. Uh, so reaction was at DC17.

[02:31:47] Speaker 8: Yeah.

[02:31:47] Speaker 3: Thingamabob.

[02:31:47] Speaker 8: She said last time.

[02:31:48] Speaker 3: Yeah.

[02:31:49] Speaker 20: How often does that? Can you use that?

[02:31:50] Speaker 3: Uh, once per day. So never mind-

[02:31:53] Speaker 20: Oh.

[02:31:53] Speaker 3: ... she has nothing.

[02:31:54] Speaker 8: That's a good point.

[02:31:55] Speaker 3: That is her turn. Next up is Kotal.

[02:31:59] Speaker 8: Kotal will-

[02:32:00] Speaker 3: Dryad.

[02:32:01] Speaker 8: ... she says an acrobatic checks to break free.

[02:32:04] Speaker 3: Um.

[02:32:05] Speaker 8: Oh.

[02:32:05] Speaker 20: Athletics or strength?

[02:32:07] Speaker 8: He said acrobatics. I didn't know if it was special or if it was a normal escape.

[02:32:10] Speaker 1: It says a D18 acrobatics check. But usually you... I would say the other methods count. That doesn't make any sense that it wouldn't. Move athletics and if you don't have athletics you're pretty much screwed.

[02:32:30] Speaker 8: I'm... (laughs) Trust me, I have athletics and acrobatics and a very good unarmed attack. Uh-

[02:32:36] Speaker 1: Uh, it says acrobatics, but, yeah, I mean, I would say that, I would say either or plus, uh-

[02:32:40] Speaker 8: If, uh, Kotal does his, like, does definitely not like being restrained even though... Is this a attack? Right?

[02:32:48] Speaker 1: Yeah, it would be considered an attack for him to escape with.

[02:32:51] Speaker 8: He's still, um... Nah, he's gonna, he's gonna start by... Since he, it doesn't stop him from attacking, he's gonna bonk the guy who webbed him first.

[02:33:05] Speaker 3: Mm.

[02:33:05] Speaker 8: No, there's no chance that a 12 hits. 16.

[02:33:14] Speaker 3: Plus?

[02:33:15] Speaker 8: That's it.

[02:33:16] Speaker 3: Blank. Which hits.

[02:33:17] Speaker 8: Oh, is it blank?

[02:33:19] Speaker 3: Yep, yeah, with me.

[02:33:19] Speaker 8: I did not see that. Uh, that is a bludgeoning.

[02:33:25] Speaker 1: Um, that would... What happens basically?

[02:33:27] Speaker 8: Yay. Um, I mean, it was a staff squarely to the side of his head, so he probably just-

[02:33:34] Speaker 3: Oh.

[02:33:34] Speaker 8: ... slumps, slumps to the ground. Um, and then he will, you know, vigorously attempt to, um, break free. What did you say the DC was?

[02:33:52] Speaker 1: Nine or 18.

[02:33:53] Speaker 3: (laughs) That was so close.

[02:33:54] Speaker 8: The second that was on an 18. Um, that's still, it would've been minus one, so it would've been a 17. No, no, that's not good. Not with minus 10 or minus eight 'cause it's actual.

[02:34:06] Speaker 20: Yeah, if they're attacking.

[02:34:07] Speaker 1: So once it falls, you guys notice the spiders that are there start to, um, lose focus, so to speak.

[02:34:13] Speaker 8: Mm, how do you-

[02:34:14] Speaker 1: And then she begins to say something. I know it's not part, not the end of the round. Oh, no, you were at the end of the round.

[02:34:18] Speaker 3: Yeah, it is the end of the round. She's about there.

[02:34:19] Speaker 1: So she gets to say something, um, somewhat angrily. And the little guys over there that were staring at you, trying to grab at you, um, turn around. It looks like they're kind of pointed now angrily at the spiders. But for the sake of time, the spiders just skitter off. Assuming you'll let them.

[02:34:38] Speaker 8: Indeed.

[02:34:39] Speaker 3: Yeah.

[02:34:39] Speaker 8: Yeah.

[02:34:40] Speaker 1: So they start scurrying away.

[02:34:43] Speaker 8: And then presumably I will eventually break free.

[02:34:46] Speaker 3: If I... I got you. Ah! I charge over with my 10-foot pole.

[02:34:51] Speaker 8: I have reached and as you get close, I trip you.

[02:34:54] Speaker 3: 10 feet. (laughs)

[02:34:57] Speaker 8: Oh.

[02:34:57] Speaker 3: And I burn his webs loose.

[02:34:59] Speaker 8: That is a 25-

[02:35:00] Speaker 20: Oh.

[02:35:00] Speaker 8: ... against your, uh, reflex DC.

[02:35:02] Speaker 3: Nope, 'cause I am not moving any farther, 'cause I got a 10-foot pole. So I got reach. Just as long as you, so I'm not actually moving through any, out of this crap, just moving into it. Yeah, but if he has 10-foot reach and you have 10-foot reach, the arch is still within-

[02:35:20] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[02:35:20] Speaker 3: So I moved in, but I don't trigger because it's my action, not his.

[02:35:23] Speaker 8: No, I had a readied action.

[02:35:25] Speaker 3: No, 'cause you went your turn and this is my turn now. (laughs)

[02:35:29] Speaker 8: Uh, 25 against your DC.

[02:35:30] Speaker 1: And I'm burning his webs free.

[02:35:32] Speaker 8: You're on the ground. You're on the ground.

[02:35:33] Speaker 20: (laughs)

[02:35:33] Speaker 1: You use legendary resistance.

[02:35:34] Speaker 3: Yep. My layer action.

[02:35:36] Speaker 1: Ah, my friends, it is good to-

[02:35:38] Speaker 3: (laughs)

[02:35:38] Speaker 1: ... see such roughhousing among peers.

[02:35:40] Speaker 3: (laughs)

[02:35:41] Speaker 1: (laughs)

[02:35:43] Speaker 3: Burn them all down.

[02:35:45] Speaker 20: Um, I think the dryad is on our side.

[02:35:47] Speaker 3: There's webs everywhere.

[02:35:48] Speaker 20: Oh, the webs sure. Yeah.

[02:35:50] Speaker 3: Burn the spiders.

[02:35:51] Speaker 20: I don't think the dryads will be totally cool with fire is all I'm saying.

[02:35:54] Speaker 3: Well, it's only a little fire.

[02:35:57] Speaker 8: Mm.

[02:35:59] Speaker 3: Mm.

[02:36:00] Speaker 1: (laughs) So you guys, um, finish it off. The dryad starts, um, speaking. Um, I will at some point look up her name, but that doesn't really-

[02:36:11] Speaker 3: (laughs)

[02:36:12] Speaker 1: ... matter at this point. Um...

[02:36:15] Speaker 8: Do we understand her?

[02:36:16] Speaker 3: Start with a G.

[02:36:17] Speaker 1: Um, actually no, unless you speak Sylvan or Spriggan.

[02:36:20] Speaker 8: What?

[02:36:20] Speaker 1: Obviously is in this world.

[02:36:21] Speaker 8: Presumably our elf friend can translate.

[02:36:23] Speaker 3: Yes, Eilish.

[02:36:24] Speaker 1: Um, she does as do the, the fairies-

[02:36:26] Speaker 3: Fairies.

[02:36:26] Speaker 1: ... who are, um, jumping in and about and flying all over her, the vines that make up her hair. Um, Eilish will look over and say, um, she begins her best, uh, thing at, uh, doing, at, uh, translating as best she can. Um, yeah, she is, uh, immensely glad for what you guys have done. Um, been willing to help out a creature such as herself from such vile, um, beings that would control spiders and force them to do their will. Um, she is, um, very honored to have you here. Um, she strides back to one of the trees, you hear kind of a breaking sound. Reaches out and hands something to you guys. Um, (clears throat) it is a club. (book slams)

Not just any club. Well, it's a mace, technically.

[02:37:20] Speaker 21: A wood club.

[02:37:21] Speaker 8: Well, there you go. And you wanted a different weapon. It fit it better.

[02:37:24] Speaker 22: No, no.

[02:37:24] Speaker 1: So, if you guys, um, you guys have, uh, what was it? Crafting?

[02:37:27] Speaker 8: I have crafting.

[02:37:28] Speaker 1: If you wanna check, you can check and see if you can figure out what it is. She'll hand it to you. It's a fine. It's made of branches. Um-

[02:37:35] Speaker 8: 19.

[02:37:36] Speaker 1: Mm-hmm. Good enough. Um, it's a, basically it's a plus one potency mace, is what it counts as. But it's a fine branch that's, um, you know, uh, basically enchanted. Uh, it's doesn't look like anything that humans made, but you can usually swing it as a, um, +1 mace. Um, but if you want to, you can take off the root and attach it to a weapon. And you think when you do, the weapon would have a, would start having this very woody, leafy, um, feel to it as it starts to grow.

[02:38:05] Speaker 22: Start growing.

[02:38:06] Speaker 1: Yep. So, that's what that is. Um-

[02:38:11] Speaker 22: Sanity?

[02:38:12] Speaker 1: And then, uh, she talks a little bit more and, uh-

[02:38:15] Speaker 8: Kotal, should, as he's studying it and discovering what it is, like has a sense of reverence. (laughs) The power of nature.

[02:38:24] Speaker 1: And she hands you guys, um... (clears throat)

[02:38:27] Speaker 8: Would you, my friends, would you mind if I, uh, cared for this weapon?

[02:38:33] Speaker 23: It's all yours, my friend.

[02:38:35] Speaker 21: Yeah, okay.

[02:38:37] Speaker 23: I prefer larger weapons. (laughs)

[02:38:44] Speaker 1: And hands you guys two of these.

[02:38:46] Speaker 22: What are these?

[02:38:48] Speaker 8: Gems.

[02:38:48] Speaker 1: Small sapphires. Which is actually the one thing we were going to do tonight but I forgot to do and that is handle coins. If you guys can look at how much gold you have in your characters real quick.

[02:38:57] Speaker 22: Just gonna grab the 2020 pouches.

[02:39:01] Speaker 8: I think I have like... Yeah, I have four gold.

[02:39:04] Speaker 23: Yeah, I don't have a lot.

[02:39:05] Speaker 8: Yeah, you had time at the end of last session.

[02:39:07] Speaker 23: I spent some in town.

[02:39:08] Speaker 21: Oh.

[02:39:08] Speaker 23: I got a healer's kit.

[02:39:10] Speaker 21: Okay. I have eight gold and some silver.

[02:39:12] Speaker 23: And a gray axe because I wanted to vary attack types in case I needed it too. (coins jingling)

[02:39:24] Speaker 8: We need like a treasure chest we can use to hold the party gems.

[02:39:29] Speaker 22: So, do we know what these do?

[02:39:31] Speaker 8: Good job. There.

[02:39:33] Speaker 22: There it goes, things like gems.

[02:39:34] Speaker 1: They're not gems but they have... They'll work in the book but, um, gems, well, the way they work is you have to bargain with them a little bit. And depending on how well your diplomacy roll goes or your chance to try to bargain with them can impact what you get for price. (coughs) So pick a bag.

[02:39:50] Speaker 8: Kotal likes red always.

[02:39:52] Speaker 1: Actually, I'm going to go to the bathroom now.

[02:39:53] Speaker 8: Irv likes red. Kotal will accept red. Go Badgers.

[02:39:59] Speaker 22: Badgers? What are these badgers you speak of?

[02:40:02] Speaker 8: They are a fierce band of, of warriors.

[02:40:06] Speaker 21: They have badgers too.

[02:40:09] Speaker 22: The badgers have badges?

[02:40:10] Speaker 21: They do.

[02:40:12] Speaker 22: I don't think they had badgers on my island.

[02:40:13] Speaker 8: Wait, can we get badges?

[02:40:14] Speaker 21: It sounds... (laughs) I can make us badges.

[02:40:19] Speaker 8: (laughs) What color you want?

[02:40:23] Speaker 21: Uh, what are the choices? Uh, I'll just take blue.

[02:40:27] Speaker 22: Give me the light blue one.

[02:40:28] Speaker 8: Whoo, missed.

[02:40:29] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[02:40:30] Speaker 8: Ooh, it's soft. You picked the soft one.

[02:40:32] Speaker 21: Ooh, I like that.

[02:40:33] Speaker 8: It's gonna help... We're doing campaign points, so.

[02:40:35] Speaker 21: Yeah.

[02:40:35] Speaker 8: This is for Jomani. And we can use... We should use the-

[02:40:42] Speaker 23: Party loot?

[02:40:44] Speaker 8: That one's kind of weird.

[02:40:45] Speaker 22: What about the big green one?

[02:40:46] Speaker 8: You want the big green one for party loot?

[02:40:49] Speaker 23: It's going to have the most of everything, money and gems.

[02:40:57] Speaker 8: We're gonna forget they're in there, they're so tiny. (laughs)

[02:41:01] Speaker 23: (laughs) Oh, we totally are. Hey, you better put that in the party loot notes.

[02:41:06] Speaker 8: Oh, who's taking party loot notes?

[02:41:08] Speaker 23: You are. Oh, you actually have the keyboard.

[02:41:11] Speaker 8: Oh.

[02:41:12] Speaker 1: Well, you're gonna have to do party loot because-

[02:41:14] Speaker 8: I know, but we're trying... Well, we're coming like we're going to totally forget there's two tiny gems in here until somebody writes it down-

[02:41:19] Speaker 23: (laughs)

[02:41:19] Speaker 8: ... because they're so small and it's a giant bag.

[02:41:21] Speaker 1: Yeah. So how much gold does your guy have? And if you have silver, from here and up we're going to round up to one gold. If it's a consumable item, find multiples of it until you get one gold.

[02:41:30] Speaker 8: 14.

[02:41:31] Speaker 1: 14?

[02:41:32] Speaker 8: Round it up. 13 and a half. Yeah, 14.

[02:41:40] Speaker 23: I would like to trade my hero points in for platinum.

[02:41:43] Speaker 1: There you go. How much?

[02:41:45] Speaker 23: (laughs) I got two if I round it up.

[02:41:48] Speaker 1: You got the two. Okay. So basically, officially, whatever you have in your front pouch is what you have.

[02:41:55] Speaker 23: Five.

[02:41:55] Speaker 1: Um, that's an easy one. But who knows, if you guys are lucky, you can eventually someday earn the 10,000 coin.

[02:42:08] Speaker 8: Yeah.

[02:42:08] Speaker 1: I got to have it organized.

[02:42:09] Speaker 8: Can I bring my campaign coins from home and add them to my pouch?

[02:42:11] Speaker 21: (laughs) No, 'cause then you'll bring them from home and it'll be 5,000.

[02:42:15] Speaker 23: I have hundreds of gold. (laughs)

[02:42:18] Speaker 1: I wanna get more but the company's in Australia.

[02:42:20] Speaker 8: I know. The shipping is brutal. Every time they get some, you better buy a lot because of the shipping.

[02:42:24] Speaker 1: Every time they're out too. Which is why I have to go to Gen Con this year. I was gonna see if they're there.

[02:42:28] Speaker 8: Oh, yeah. Let me know. I, if they're there, I can bring stuff back for you. I'm switching this to party loot. The black one is party loot. But-

[02:42:35] Speaker 1: But party loot... Well, you can put them there if you want to. Um, party loot is going to be held by-

[02:42:39] Speaker 23: The treasurer, whoever that is.

[02:42:40] Speaker 8: Well, whoever, until of she's here.

[02:42:41] Speaker 23: Until Little Fairy, yeah.

[02:42:45] Speaker 1: Wow. So is that just the small gems?

[02:42:47] Speaker 8: That's the two gems.

[02:42:47] Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

[02:42:49] Speaker 8: Um, yeah, unless somebody wants to put them in their pockets.

[02:42:52] Speaker 1: If you want to, put them in this.

[02:42:54] Speaker 21: Why don't you stuff that in another one of our pouches?

[02:42:55] Speaker 1: Put them in this and then put this in your pouch.

[02:42:57] Speaker 21: Yeah.

[02:42:57] Speaker 1: And that way, it's over there. I might, I might have some little plastic baggies around here somewhere too. We can use them next time.

[02:43:02] Speaker 8: I have a zillion plastic bags-

[02:43:05] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[02:43:05] Speaker 8: ... from board game stuff so I can bring in some little transparent ones so that we can see what's in them.

[02:43:09] Speaker 1: Oh, yeah. Yeah, I know I have some little tiny ones around here. If you guys want, if they're bigger or thicker, you guys wanna use those instead.

[02:43:15] Speaker 8: All right, I'll bring... I have so many from, like, board game obsession years that I'll just bring them in and you can pick what you like.

[02:43:21] Speaker 1: Um, so the Little Fey are, um-You think where, you rest up, um, (instrumental music) the, uh, willow dry it, uh, is, is super happy. She heals up you guys and, uh, brings up some nice fruits, berries, nuts and whatnot that you guys can eat for dinner. Um-

[02:43:41] Speaker 24: Mm-hmm, fudge!

[02:43:41] Speaker 1: ... if you're, you know, if you want to all that much. Um, before, um, helping you out, the two, the, the little fairies offer you guys... They know where you can get some treasure and they'd be happy to take you there. Um-

[02:43:56] Speaker 24: Treasure?

[02:43:57] Speaker 1: So you start heading back. Um, they take you to, um... Eventually you pass by, um, Ailish is where they're from. Um, she says, "If you guys ever need anything, feel free to see her over here." And you can tell the bridge isn't far away. You know you could get here without any danger. Um-

[02:44:14] Speaker 25: Probably-

[02:44:14] Speaker 26: Who is saying this?

[02:44:15] Speaker 1: Ailish.

[02:44:15] Speaker 25: Any elf?

[02:44:16] Speaker 27: Okay.

[02:44:17] Speaker 1: Yeah. She basically hands you a few acorns and she says, "Keep this in your pouch. They'll help protect you to get over here." So basically that's just way of your knowing if you're going basically this world, if you wander anywhere away from, from the crossing, you're probably dead. But this will protect you to her, you know-

[02:44:35] Speaker 27: Okay.

[02:44:35] Speaker 1: ... her place and back 'cause she's a... Otherwise you'd never be able to interact with one of the, um, main NPCs. Um-

[02:44:41] Speaker 27: It was a pleasure meeting you, Ailish.

[02:44:44] Speaker 1: Um, she says, "Yes, as well." Um, oh... I can't remember the other-

[02:44:50] Speaker 26: (sneezes)

[02:44:50] Speaker 27: Bless you.

[02:44:50] Speaker 1: Um, anyway, um-

[02:44:51] Speaker 27: (sneezes). Bless you.

[02:44:52] Speaker 1: She nods politely and, um, "Wishes you guys would come visit some more. She may have need of some assistance, um-"

[02:45:00] Speaker 27: Yes, I'm, well I'm wanting to see this strawberry patch.

[02:45:03] Speaker 1: She, um, Grim, Grimgar, I might say Grimgar a lot, um, says, "Well, you guys have shown yourself quite, uh, strong in battle. Um, well, perhaps, um, you'd be welcome to come visit me as well." He points to a part on the lake, um, not too far away from-

[02:45:24] Speaker 27: The one with the house?

[02:45:26] Speaker 1: ... the island. Um-

[02:45:28] Speaker 27: The island with the house or a different one?

[02:45:29] Speaker 1: What's that?

[02:45:30] Speaker 27: Island with the house or are you thinking on the shore?

[02:45:32] Speaker 1: He's kind of just off of the shore.

[02:45:34] Speaker 27: Okay.

[02:45:34] Speaker 1: He's in that way. He has a little thing he built where he should be safe. Um, he says, "Just be careful. I, uh, to grow my, um... I am interested in growing, uh, honey for mead, um, and selling that. Um, as the caravans go there's plenty of plants and plenty to pollinate. So I've been keeping bees, so I've been busy tending that, but, uh, feel free. Um, I should perhaps like to see you again sometime. And I may also have need of you." Um, so the fae, wanting to reward you guys, um, take you to this place where there's this nice little round patch on the ground and there's plenty of gooey bits. Um-

[02:46:17] Speaker 26: Is this the lost gnome hoard?

[02:46:18] Speaker 1: (coughs) You, mm, definitely recognize this spot. Um, because yeah, this is where the, uh, they brought the other stone statues to life for a few seconds.

[02:46:30] Speaker 26: Mm.

[02:46:30] Speaker 1: Um, and if they see treasure and they point and there are their backpacks which, um-

[02:46:36] Speaker 26: (laughs) Oh.

[02:46:36] Speaker 1: ... managed to survive. Um, uh, you guys start going through their backpacks. Um, and there is a ax.

[02:46:45] Speaker 26: Thank you, little ones.

[02:46:46] Speaker 27: That's Frank's.

[02:46:49] Speaker 1: Where did I put that? Too much crap.

[02:46:53] Speaker 27: Is it a great ax or just a regular old meat ax?

[02:46:57] Speaker 1: Battle ax. It is a one-handed one. Now it has a... Well, you wanna do crafting?

[02:47:03] Speaker 27: It's got runes it doesn't matter what it is.

[02:47:05] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[02:47:09] Speaker 25: Uh, 13.

[02:47:12] Speaker 1: We're gonna say that's high enough so I don't have to... I can't remember the DCs off the top of my head.

[02:47:16] Speaker 25: It's 15 usually.

[02:47:17] Speaker 1: Oh. I'm gonna... You can figure it out. This is, it has a plus one potency rune since... Yeah. So-

[02:47:25] Speaker 25: Another plus one rating.

[02:47:26] Speaker 1: Excuse me.

[02:47:27] Speaker 27: We can exchange it.

[02:47:29] Speaker 25: I can, I can transfer it with my crafting.

[02:47:31] Speaker 27: Oh, that would be very handy.

[02:47:32] Speaker 25: It might take some time. We'll need to do it in town.

[02:47:34] Speaker 27: Okay.

[02:47:35] Speaker 1: If you guys want to rest for this, you're resting overnight, we say over the night you guys can do it so you don't have to hold onto the cards. You can just go ahead and add that here.

[02:47:42] Speaker 27: Checking that into my model then.

[02:47:44] Speaker 1: (coughs) Yeah.

[02:47:44] Speaker 27: Cool.

[02:47:44] Speaker 1: We'll say you're gonna do it overnight, zero out the anger anyways. It'll be the next day before you do, do it again. Um, there is a ring in the, uh... Well, no, it's actually not a ring in there. Um, the fae also... Well, you dig through the, the pouch and you look through everything.

[02:48:01] Speaker 24: My friend-

[02:48:02] Speaker 1: ... and-

[02:48:02] Speaker 24: Do you want to roll for the potency rune?

[02:48:05] Speaker 26: No, you can use it better than I.

[02:48:07] Speaker 24: Thank you, Michael.

[02:48:08] Speaker 25: Mm-hmm.

[02:48:10] Speaker 24: There's a ring.

[02:48:11] Speaker 26: Sorry.

[02:48:12] Speaker 27: Dells provides.

[02:48:14] Speaker 1: Okay, let me see real quick.

[02:48:17] Speaker 27: Just loot my friends. My companions. Take all their gear. (coins jingling) I'm fine. (laughs)

[02:48:25] Speaker 24: Did you know these people?

[02:48:26] Speaker 27: Yes. (laughs)

[02:48:29] Speaker 24: This... Huh. My friend, this must be quite tough for you.

[02:48:35] Speaker 27: They're a bunch of bastards. (laughs)

[02:48:36] Speaker 1: So there is some gold in their pouches as well. You guys can divide that up. About 10 altogether. I can subdivide that up actually.

[02:48:45] Speaker 25: I do have to remember the ring, the things. This is, uh-

[02:48:48] Speaker 1: They all look a little different.

[02:48:50] Speaker 26: The cross is five.

[02:48:50] Speaker 25: Cross is five.

[02:48:51] Speaker 26: This is one.

[02:48:52] Speaker 1: You have to look for the thing on 'em because there's two different types of gold in there, but they all have numbers on them.

[02:48:56] Speaker 25: That one doesn't have a number. Square.

[02:48:58] Speaker 26: Yeah, this one doesn't have a number either. Oh, it's this.

[02:48:59] Speaker 1: They do, but it's really small in one of the corner, one of the top sides. Let me see, otherwise I can't tell.

[02:49:06] Speaker 27: That's supposed to be a one there too.

[02:49:07] Speaker 28: Uh, try the other side.

[02:49:10] Speaker 26: One?

[02:49:10] Speaker 27: Yeah.

[02:49:11] Speaker 28: Oh, one, yeah. Okay.

[02:49:13] Speaker 1: The square ones are always easy.

[02:49:14] Speaker 25: Which one is it supposed to be?

[02:49:15] Speaker 27: One.

[02:49:15] Speaker 28: One.

[02:49:16] Speaker 25: That's eight gold. That's a one.

[02:49:19] Speaker 28: Should be a five.

[02:49:20] Speaker 24: Um-

[02:49:20] Speaker 25: These are supposed to be twos?

[02:49:24] Speaker 1: I thought they were. They must have got fell in the wrong...

[02:49:26] Speaker 26: How about we make it an even nine?

[02:49:28] Speaker 1: Yeah, we can do that. (laughs)

[02:49:30] Speaker 29: Yeah.

[02:49:30] Speaker 1: So I'll just give you guys each three, so-

[02:49:32] Speaker 3: Or, uh, I guess if you go 10-

[02:49:33] Speaker 29: Same.

[02:49:33] Speaker 3: ... then one for the party then. I don't know.

[02:49:35] Speaker 1: Here we go. Two, two, and this is also a two. I'll take the five. And I'll throw a single one.

[02:49:46] Speaker 8: Five's gone.

[02:49:46] Speaker 1: I'm gonna grab me a pouch for party loot. Actually, we'll do this one.

[02:49:49] Speaker 8: This is the, here's the party loot's in here. You told me to put the...

[02:49:52] Speaker 1: (clears throat) Well, no, that's whoever wants to hold onto it. Or, oh, you want to do that? Here.

[02:49:55] Speaker 8: Yeah.

[02:49:55] Speaker 1: So I'll just have that.

[02:49:56] Speaker 8: That's got the gems in it.

[02:49:57] Speaker 1: I'll keep that with, uh... Yeah, that's a good color 'cause that matches Vidia-

[02:50:01] Speaker 8: Yeah.

[02:50:02] Speaker 1: ... who is also mostly purple. And when we finish up you can just put the pouches over on the... yeah, right over there. Um-

[02:50:11] Speaker 3: You said we also got a ring of something?

[02:50:13] Speaker 1: Well-

[02:50:13] Speaker 8: He changed his mind. It was mine instead.

[02:50:15] Speaker 3: Oh.

[02:50:15] Speaker 1: No, 'cause one of the fey comes up and she was really happy, um, Silvermist. And says, "Noble friends, you have, um, done well defeating the spiders. And you have proven, uh, your good intentions through the tests. We would present you with this." And she holds up, in this case it's the size of her head, but it's a ring.

[02:50:36] Speaker 3: Hmm.

[02:50:37] Speaker 1: Once again, you can...

[02:50:40] Speaker 3: Ooh, that's a good roll.

[02:50:42] Speaker 8: 22.

[02:50:43] Speaker 3: That's like a critical roll, so that's like-

[02:50:45] Speaker 8: It is a-

[02:50:45] Speaker 3: ... double the value of the ring. It's like two rings.

[02:50:50] Speaker 1: Reading ring.

[02:50:54] Speaker 3: What's that do?

[02:50:55] Speaker 1: It's weird. (laughs) It basically lets you read in dim light.

[02:50:59] Speaker 8: Oh.

[02:50:59] Speaker 3: Is that like a real item?

[02:51:00] Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

[02:51:01] Speaker 3: I didn't know if it was like a custom item.

[02:51:04] Speaker 1: As much as I can find weird stuff, you guys will probably be fine today.

[02:51:10] Speaker 3: I'm okay with that. Other, it's a lot of the like loot is kinda boring.

[02:51:13] Speaker 1: I mean, I figured I could give a few potent spoons here and there but-

[02:51:16] Speaker 3: Yeah.

[02:51:16] Speaker 1: ... I'll start looking at some of the other weird ones, uh, once you guys are a little bit better set.

[02:51:20] Speaker 3: I don't think it, I don't think Pathfinder second edition has many of them.

[02:51:23] Speaker 8: There's a ring that helps you read at night. It's supposed to be for people who have vision problems, but whatever.

[02:51:31] Speaker 29: Is it worth 7,000 gold by chance? 15?

[02:51:35] Speaker 8: Uh, it is... The greater reading ring is worth 1,800 gold.

[02:51:39] Speaker 29: Hmm.

[02:51:40] Speaker 8: So, so that is a level 12 item and this is probably the level one version.

[02:51:43] Speaker 29: Probably.

[02:51:44] Speaker 3: 15. (laughs)

[02:51:45] Speaker 8: Which is worth 15.

[02:51:46] Speaker 3: (laughs)

[02:51:47] Speaker 8: (laughs)

[02:51:47] Speaker 3: There's a little difference.

[02:51:48] Speaker 8: But also, I'm not sure why anybody would buy this given the description.

[02:51:52] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[02:51:52] Speaker 8: It's kind of sp- designed so once it's been bonded to somebody it can never be used by anybody else.

[02:51:58] Speaker 3: Oh. Yeah. Does it let you read like different languages?

[02:52:03] Speaker 1: Now one thing I'll also let you guys do, since this is mostly a trading bartering place, um, typical selling is half gold but there is a chance you can try to barter with it, where you can get... If you're exchanging for something else you might get a better chunk of its value, more than what we paid.

[02:52:18] Speaker 3: That might be worth something to try to, to sell.

[02:52:20] Speaker 8: All right. Well, I can... (dice rolling)

[02:52:26] Speaker 1: Why don't they take you guys back? Um-

[02:52:28] Speaker 8: I'll create a document for non-gold party loot tracking.

[02:52:33] Speaker 1: Yeah. Well eventually that's also gonna-

[02:52:35] Speaker 8: Maybe we get cards.

[02:52:35] Speaker 1: Basically I'll have the card for her and it'll go in her card if you guys don't assign it to someone. Um, just remember you have it for now. By next week if you're able to bring those back then it'll... 'Cause I didn't have any rings surprisingly.

[02:52:46] Speaker 8: We found a reading ring.

[02:52:48] Speaker 30: Yep.

[02:52:48] Speaker 1: (laughs) So.

[02:52:51] Speaker 8: It'll be in the list.

[02:52:52] Speaker 30: Yeah.

[02:52:54] Speaker 8: We're going to put it in party loot.

[02:52:58] Speaker 1: Yeah. She'll be your party loot holder.

[02:52:59] Speaker 8: And she can... And you're gonna have item cards.

[02:53:02] Speaker 30: Yeah.

[02:53:02] Speaker 1: And so basically if you, and if no one's claimed it, it'll be on her. And then once someone claims it you just add it to your thing and then the card goes back, so...

[02:53:09] Speaker 8: Okay.

[02:53:11] Speaker 3: Um-

[02:53:11] Speaker 30: I definitely have a few cards.

[02:53:13] Speaker 8: Do you want to, are we gonna use item cards for consumables?

[02:53:16] Speaker 1: Uh, no, that one's... Um, initially yes. She'll hold it if no one claims it. If someone claims it then...

[02:53:22] Speaker 8: Just for your laboratory inventories or anything that we have ourselves?

[02:53:25] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[02:53:25] Speaker 8: Okay. Okay.

[02:53:28] Speaker 1: I didn't, I... With my select, I don't know, I think I have some potions but I couldn't find it.

[02:53:31] Speaker 8: Yeah. It's-

[02:53:32] Speaker 1: Ken has a ton. Ken's section's far larger than mine.

[02:53:35] Speaker 3: The cards?

[02:53:36] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[02:53:36] Speaker 3: Yeah, I bought a lot of those things.

[02:53:39] Speaker 1: But yeah, that's it for now. You guys head back home. Um, it's not... If you take the direct path and not wind through the forest like you guys did earlier-

[02:53:46] Speaker 8: It's like three minutes.

[02:53:47] Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not so bad, so-

[02:53:48] Speaker 8: We walk for two and a half minutes and come out into the open and see the bridge.

[02:53:52] Speaker 3: Well, that doesn't take long.

[02:53:54] Speaker 1: And yeah, if you're able to, uh, come in, you're able to... It's late by, night by this point, so you hop in, basically in bed again. Uh, wake up in the morning just to find there's perhaps another adventure afoot.

[02:54:04] Speaker 3: Before they leave, the, uh, fairies leave, I wanted to question them about the, uh, the gnomish, uh, uh, the great gnomish treasure hoard that's missing out here that was stolen from the IRS.

[02:54:18] Speaker 8: I mean, we can talk about it next time.

[02:54:20] Speaker 1: General room service.

[02:54:20] Speaker 8: I do, I do want to at some point in a moment of quiet have a conversation with the captain.

[02:54:24] Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

[02:54:25] Speaker 8: But we'll, we can wait till everybody's here.

[02:54:29] Speaker 1: Yeah. Yeah, so it'll be next week, um, next week is the last session in the introductory part, so generally I don't stay this long at Level 1. But I wanted to at least get through all the introductions, so you guys will meet the remainder of the, uh, uh, Drimasticae next week and-

[02:54:42] Speaker 3: Who did I miss last week?

[02:54:44] Speaker 1: Oh, the two on the board there, Lynn and Sylvia.

[02:54:47] Speaker 8: Lynn and Syl- Lynn is an old monkish man. We don't actually know much about him other than he's an old man who acts like a monk.

[02:54:55] Speaker 29: Mm-hmm.

[02:54:55] Speaker 8: Um, and Sylvia was...

[02:54:59] Speaker 30: She was, um...

[02:55:00] Speaker 8: Oh yeah, I remember what her stats were.

[02:55:01] Speaker 30: She gave me Alden vibe, but I don't know.

[02:55:03] Speaker 8: Yeah. Um, but I mean, I don't remember what she, she did. She healed us a couple times.

[02:55:07] Speaker 1: So-

[02:55:07] Speaker 8: Or maybe she just used medicine to stabilize it. She's the one who kept bringing us back.

[02:55:11] Speaker 1: Oh, that would've been him.

[02:55:12] Speaker 8: Oh, that's him? Okay.

[02:55:13] Speaker 3: That was Lynn.

[02:55:14] Speaker 1: She would be classified as, closest thing to think of is a, um, who is it? The one who uses panache? Um...

[02:55:22] Speaker 3: Swashbuckler.

[02:55:22] Speaker 1: Swashbuckler. That's the closest thing she would be. Now your character might know something, the name Mornhuld wouldn't actually mean something to you. Um, uh, in your case, like I'll send you a note to me. That, that way you can introduce her to the party too if you feel like it, so...

[02:55:41] Speaker 8: These are empty.

[02:55:42] Speaker 1: But it would, might mean something to you.

[02:55:44] Speaker 8: Where do you want us to keep the not empty ones? Um, you can just put 'em on top of the printer or something like that. I'll try to get a little-

[02:55:49] Speaker 3: Should we put our name in them so we know which is what?

[02:55:51] Speaker 8: My name is, mine is red.

[02:55:53] Speaker 3: We can color code it.

[02:55:54] Speaker 29: Yeah.

[02:55:55] Speaker 1: Just remember what color you have.

[02:55:57] Speaker 3: I have one with the most money in it.

[02:56:00] Speaker 29: I am chatbot.

[02:56:02] Speaker 3: Chatbot, I have the most money in my pouch, whatever color it is. (laughs)

[02:56:07] Speaker 1: And that's like-

[02:56:08] Speaker 3: I like blue. And I'll be missing next week.

[02:56:10] Speaker 8: All right, I'm stopping-

[02:56:11] Speaker 3: Oh, yeah, sorry. You're the one who couldn't-
