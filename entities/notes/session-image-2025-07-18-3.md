# Chains Broken, Storms Ended

## Prompt

```
Epic fantasy digital painting, climactic divine ritual scene at ancient stone ruins shrouded in supernatural mist. An elderly chef-turned-cleric (male human with wild white hair like storm clouds, weathered face with deep lines, wearing worn leather vest over simple shirt, holding wooden staff) performs complex religious magic while golden divine light emanates from ritual components (antique lantern and shovel). Around him, the spirits of a tragic couple materialize - a desperate middle-aged man in commoner's clothes rapidly aging to dust as his binding breaks, and a grateful woman's spirit departing on wind that tastes of freedom. Stone ruins with scattered circles and an arch frame the scene, while supernatural fog begins to dissipate and storm clouds overhead start to clear for the first time in decades. Art style: epic fantasy, divine magic effects, dramatic lighting contrasts between golden ritual light and dissipating darkness. Wide shot emphasizing the scale of liberation from decades of supernatural imprisonment.
```
