# The Scholar's Discovery

## Prompt

```
Epic fantasy digital painting, scholarly revelation scene in a rustic tavern mess hall where ancient knowledge meets present mystery. A green-scaled lizardfolk monk (male Slaan with distinctive reptilian features, bright green scales with lighter coloration on snout and throat, wearing practical leather armor with straps) spreads detailed parchment drawings across a wooden table with deliberate precision. Beside the table stands a cheerful female hob server (green-gray skin, bright golden eyes, vibrant green bob haircut, wearing teal apron dress over white blouse) holding a wooden charm depicting a dwarf with helmet and hammer. Other party members - a pale dhampir woman in dark gothic clothing, a bearded Norn man in blue Nordic garments, and a white-bearded dwarven slayer - lean in with growing interest. Warm tavern lighting illuminates the drawings and charm, creating atmosphere of academic discovery. Art style: detailed fantasy realism with scholarly atmosphere. Medium shot emphasizing the connection between the charm and the drawings.
