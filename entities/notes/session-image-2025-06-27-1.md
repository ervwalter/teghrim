# The Jailor's First Strike

## Prompt

```
Epic fantasy digital painting, massive undead colossus throwing chunks of its own decaying flesh at adventurers in a dark forest clearing, the Jailor (twenty-foot-tall skeletal giant with massive iron cage built into its ribcage containing trapped screaming victims, wrapped in tattered robes and dragging rusted chains, skull-like head with curved bone horns), striking down a Norn spellcaster (male human with long dark hair, well-groomed beard, elaborate blue Nordic clothing with golden mystical symbols, bird skull pendant), while a dhampir investigator (female vampire with porcelain-pale skin, crimson eyes, black bob haircut, gothic leather jacket over corsets) prepares her crossbow, dark twisted trees surrounding them, sickly green aura emanating from the creature, dynamic action composition with the flesh projectile mid-flight. Horror fantasy atmosphere, dramatic chiaroscuro lighting.
```
