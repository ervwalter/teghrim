33. **ACTION**: [00:29:37] Bruldin investigates his backstory - specifically Battle of Rothfuss Delta from 80 years ago

34. **DIALOGUE**: [00:29:50] Bruldin to Irka: "I'd like to investigate, see if I can figure out what happened to some of the dwarven survivors, or probably no survivors. Bruldin doesn't think there are any, but maybe find their bodies, lay them to rest properly"

35. **LORE**: [00:30:10] Irka responds - knows of the battle (pretty large), wasn't involved as he's from western dwarven lands which weren't involved

36. **NPC**: [00:30:30] Irka suggests potential information sources:
   - The two Duergar at the crossing might know something
   - Gierr (the Norn) may know since Norn were obviously involved (though easily could not have been alive 80 years ago)

   - Black Templars were much smaller organization back then, now one of major religions spreading

42. **SKILL**: [00:31:51] Alrik spends second day with Lyn Chong using Performance skill - plays lute and regales him with story about Gia (Gaia), rolled 17 (not quite enough)

51. **ITEM**: [00:36:00] Cold iron maul cost calculation: 40 gold base + 4 gold per bulk, mauls are 2 bulk = 48 gold total

52. **ACTION**: [00:36:20] Bruldin makes down payment on cold iron maul (short 7 gold currently)

53. **DIALOGUE**: [00:36:30] Alrik jokes: Offers to loan Bruldin 7 gold at "200% a day" interest

54. **PLANNING**: [00:36:45] Michael notes also needs to afford rune transfers from old weapon (10% of rune cost)

55. **LORE**: [00:37:00] GM note - party knows someone (likely through Sylvia) who "knows a guy" who can do rune transfers, but they have to be friends with her first

58. **DIALOGUE**: [00:38:00] Sigrid tells Arnor: "Be kinda careful when those Black Templars were here. They definitely have paid interest into the carvings"

59. **LORE**: [00:38:20] Sigrid notes Copyton Wolf and his daughter are both followers of Tyrael (archangel over law, order, society) - very lawful types who "don't super dislike witches, but they also don't like them either"

60. **ITEM**: [00:38:45] Arnor completes third day of prayer and receives **augury token** - takes 10 minutes to use as ritual, functions like augury spell (ask "Will this action be good, neutral, or negative?" and get weal/woe/neutral answer)

61. **LORE**: [00:39:15] GM promises more information during week about possible witch cult recruits and potential ritual locations near town - meeting in town would be risky, Sigrid has ideas about nearby secure locations

77. **DIALOGUE**: [00:43:55] Grogug: "Well, you know, when you guys come back, you bring it to me, you know, maybe I can see you perhaps waiving a certain fee, you know, for a time or two. Always up for that. Oh, you can quarter it up if you need to. But, you cut it up and bring some pieces, I'll consider, you know, maybe waive a fee for a few times. Not that I wouldn't want some mendels to go with my drake, you know. Now that would be absolutely prime with you guys"

78. **DIALOGUE**: [00:44:20] Aurelia (Katie): "He eats medals?"

79. **CLARIFICATION**: [00:44:25] Party explains - Mendels is name of bakery/baker, not medals

80. **ACTION**: [00:44:30] Grogug removes barriers and party heads to top of falls

81. **OOC**: [00:44:38] Party jokes about going different directions - Alrik mentions pirates, going to coast

85. **DIALOGUE**: [00:45:55] Alrik: "Qotal is very interested in returning to the dwarven statue keep. The main reason that my character exists. The pirates joke is done and now we're headed straight for the salt mines. AKA dwarven stronghold"

### Raft Crafting Challenge [00:47:57 - 00:51:39]

90. **DIALOGUE**: [00:47:05] Qotal: "Before we come up here, if we're gonna cross the river, maybe we should see about hauling a boat up with us and just rowing down the river so we have something to cross the lake with"

91. **LORE**: [00:47:20] GM explains getting boat up falls would be very difficult due to switchback paths - suggests making something like canoe or raft instead

97. **DIALOGUE**: [00:49:15] Bruldin: "Who says we don't have nuclear power? We do have fae that glow. Way to grind her up. Nuclear power is basically just rocks that are hot and they spin a turbine. I'm sure we can find some magic rocks that stay hot. So fae nuclear power basically is a steam boat"

98. **DIALOGUE**: [00:49:35] Qotal: "Instead of guinea pig power, how about fae power? We can get a bunch of little fae, put them in treadmill wheels. I know where there's a lot of fae. All I have to do is start telling the wheels. I could just start telling this story that I know and they'll all come to us"

99. **DIALOGUE**: [00:49:50] Alrik: "Or you can just push something shiny in front of them"

100. **ROLEPLAY**: [00:49:41] GM reminds Kent that Vidia has been begging for stories

103. **DIALOGUE**: [00:50:25] GM: "She'll lick her lips and listen. And if you mention there's warm cups of tea, she is definitely interested"

104. **DIALOGUE**: [00:50:35] Alrik: "Oh, when we camp tonight, I'll make you some special biscuits with rocks in them"

105. **LORE**: [00:50:43] GM note - party can build additional watercraft over time and keep them at Upper Falls area for future use, could later build sails, anchors, astrolabes

106. **PLANNING**: [00:50:50] Party discusses raft vs canoes

107. **DIALOGUE**: [00:51:00] Qotal: "I would say probably a raft rather than canoes so we can hop on one and... Rafts are more straightforward"

117. **SCENE**: [01:05:22] Halfway across water, party starts noticing smoke rising from island

   - Arnor: "No, they melt"
   - Bruldin: "Oh, then they become ice men"

126. **LORE**: [01:10:16] GM provides actual information (Qotal's knowledge):
   - Mix between yeti and ogre
   - Intelligent enough to make camps, can speak and cook things
   - Do not like lizards (eating lizardfolk makes them sick)
   - Intelligence probably less than human, on par with ogres

127. **LORE**: [01:10:59] Alrik confirms these creatures do not like to eat lizard folk - it makes them sick (necrosis comment)
