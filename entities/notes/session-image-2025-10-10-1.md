# Qotal's Theatrical Stand Against Persistent Fairies

## Prompt

```
Epic fantasy digital painting, a green-scaled Slaan monk (male lizardfolk with bright green scales, lighter coloration on snout and throat, wearing practical leather armor with straps and buckles, wielding bo staff with cold iron cap on end) theatrically swatting at three hovering fairies in a ransacked treehouse interior, Silvermist the purple-winged fairy maintains exactly ten feet distance while continuing her epic tale, pink Iridessa and male Fawn retreat cautiously, scattered books and botanical samples strewn across floor and furniture with pages fluttering through open windows, morning sunlight streaming in, warm golden light contrasting with cool shadows, whimsical chaos meets martial discipline. Art style: detailed painterly fantasy illustration, vibrant colors, storybook quality with edge of comedy. Composition emphasizes Qotal's measured patience versus fey enthusiasm, medium shot capturing both the monk's theatrical performance and the fairies' careful retreat.
```

## Context
