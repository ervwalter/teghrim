# Septerra Calendar System

The world of Septerra follows a unique calendar system with consistent structure across all months and a week that begins on Saturday.

## Calendar Structure

- **Days per Month**: 35 days exactly
- **Months per Year**: 12 months
- **Days per Year**: 420 days
- **Week Start**: Saturday
- **Days per Week**: 7 days

## Months of the Year

The Septerra calendar consists of twelve months, each with exactly 35 days:

1. **Heim-Beerus** - First month of the year
2. **Heim-Mystra** - Second month
3. **Fon-Tyrael** - Third month
4. **Fon-Dibella** - Fourth month
5. **Fon-Gaia** - Fifth month
6. **Aestra-Stendar** - Sixth month
7. **Aestra-Helios** - Seventh month
8. **Aestra-Orpheus** - Eighth month
9. **Aut-Luna** - Ninth month
10. **Aut-Pharasma** - Tenth month
11. **Aut-Teclis** - Eleventh month
12. **Heim-Wee Jas** - Twelfth and final month

*Note: For player reference, these months correspond to Earth's January through December in order, but these Earth names do not exist in the world of Septerra.*

## Month Prefixes

The months are organized into four seasonal groupings, each with a distinct prefix:

- **Heim-** months: Heim-Beerus, Heim-Mystra, Heim-Wee Jas (Winter months)
- **Fon-** months: Fon-Tyrael, Fon-Dibella, Fon-Gaia (Spring months)
- **Aestra-** months: Aestra-Stendar, Aestra-Helios, Aestra-Orpheus (Summer months)
- **Aut-** months: Aut-Luna, Aut-Pharasma, Aut-Teclis (Autumn months)

## Week Structure

Each week begins on Saturday and follows a seven-day cycle. With 35 days per month, each month contains exactly 5 complete weeks.

## Date Format

Dates are typically written as: "[Day number] [Month name]"

- Example: "14th Aestra-Orpheus" or "Aestra-Orpheus 14th"

## Calendar Context

Many of the month names appear to reference deities from the Septerra pantheon, suggesting a religious or cultural significance to the calendar structure. The consistent 35-day months and 420-day years indicate a highly ordered calendar system, possibly magically or divinely maintained.
