# The Necromancer's Welcome

## Prompt

```
Epic fantasy digital painting, ominous necromantic scene in massive bone-filled dungeon chamber. The Fleshcrafter (large tall female creature with no visible eyes, horns covering head like grotesque crown, wearing cloak made of flayed skins - different colors and sizes stitched together, some clearly humanoid) stands on raised stone platform gesturing with languid authority as skeletal remains assemble themselves from massive bone pile covering chamber floor. Multiple human-sized skeletons rising from scattered remains, including one towering large skeleton. Four battle-worn adventurers in foreground - green-scaled lizardfolk monk (male Slaan with bright green scales, leather armor), elderly chef with wild white hair (male human in worn vest, wooden staff), Nordic man with long dark hair (male human in elaborate blue clothing with golden mystical symbols), bare-chested dwarf with white braided beard (male dwarf with scarred torso, massive warhammer). Small luminous sprite with purple-pink hair hovers nervously. Oppressive darkness broken only by sprite's glow and eerie necromantic energy as bones click and grind into undead warriors. Cloth pouch visible dropped inside doorway behind necromancer. Art style: detailed, painterly, gothic horror aesthetic. Composition emphasizes necromancer's commanding presence and the rising skeletal army between her and the party.
```

## Context

After the party defeats giant rats in the bone chamber, the Fleshcrafter necromancer emerges from deeper passages dragging a mysterious pouch. Following Alrik's sarcastic greeting about being the "neighborhood welcoming committee," she coldly commands the bones to rise, creating a skeleton army to capture the intruders alive.
