# Breath of the Nexus

The Breath of the Nexus is a cyclical natural phenomenon where ley line nexuses—concentrated points of magical energy—release or "exhale" a surge of energy at regular intervals. The [entity:7764101|Willow Dryad] describes these pulses as "like nature is exhaling a bunch of energy," giving the phenomenon its name. These breaths occur at regular intervals, though forest-born creatures like dryads don't track time precisely enough to know exactly how many years or seasons pass between each occurrence.

## Nature of the Phenomenon

**Cyclical Energy Release**: Ley line nexuses periodically release concentrated bursts of natural magical energy. The pulses occur at "very regular intervals," suggesting a predictable natural cycle rather than random events.

**Regular Intervals**: The time between Breaths is consistent, though the exact duration remains unknown. The [entity:7764101|Willow Dryad] suggests [entity:7764102|Aelysh] might be able to calculate the interval between pulses, as she maintains more precise records than forest-born creatures.

**Geographic Scope**: Each nexus presumably has its own Breath cycle. The positive nexus near [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing] in the waterfall region and the negative nexus in [entity:7763172|Astoria] may operate on different or synchronized schedules.

## Effects and Implications

**Espada Departure**: The Breath appears connected to when Espada (or Rhonqar) depart from their associated nexuses. Genovian should have left the waterfall region before the last Breath of the Nexus, according to the [entity:7764101|Willow Dryad].

**Timing References**: Forest-born creatures use the Breath as a time marker for significant events, similar to how humans might reference years or decades. The dryad hasn't seen Genovian "since before the last breath of the nexus."

**Current Cycle**: The region is currently "a ways out" from the next Breath, suggesting the most recent one occurred some time ago.

## Ley Line Nexuses

**Non-Linear Geography**: Ley lines aren't straight—they "arc and move like energy does." Nexus locations exist in geographic areas but "tend to change" rather than remaining at fixed points.

**Positive and Negative**: There are at least two types of nexuses. The waterfall region near [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing] hosts a positive nexus, while a negative nexus exists far south across the mountain range in [entity:7763172|Astoria].

**Nexus Locations**:
- Positive: Elevated waterfall plateau north/south of the waterfalls, "in this vicinity, more so in these upper regions"
- Negative: [entity:7763172|Astoria], across Himalaya-like mountain range, approximately 5+ hexes south

## Mysteries

- What causes the Breath to occur at regular intervals?
- How long is the interval between Breaths?
- What is the difference between positive and negative nexuses?
- Why must Espada depart when the Breath occurs?
- What happens if an Espada doesn't depart? Is Genovian's situation (emanations persisting) related to failure to depart?
- Does the Breath affect the surrounding region beyond the nexus itself?
