# Battle on the Corrupted Bridge

## Prompt

```
Epic fantasy digital painting, dramatic battle scene on a weathered wooden bridge over a shallow ravine, a Norn spellcaster (male human with long dark hair, blue Nordic robes with golden runic symbols, bird skull pendant) channels crackling white-blue lightning between his raised hands while two amorphous rust oozes the color of old copper surge upward through splintering planks. A dhampir warrior (female with pale skin, black bob, gothic leather armor) dances back as her steel blade corrodes and pits from contact with the oozes, a dwarven slayer (male dwarf with white beard, bare scarred torso) swings his deteriorating maul like a club, and a wood elf druid (female elf with bronze skin, long black hair adorned with vines and berries, green leaf-woven clothing) prepares nature magic. The bridge shows decades of decay compressed into moments, metal fixtures rusting instantly. Dramatic lighting with the lightning bolt illuminating the scene against a diseased forest backdrop. Dynamic action painting style, wide shot showing the desperate battle on the failing bridge.
```
