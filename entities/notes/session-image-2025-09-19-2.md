# Botanical Scholars

## Prompt

```
Epic fantasy digital painting, intimate scholarly exchange in treehouse home built within massive redwood-like tree near frontier bridge settlement. Warm afternoon light filters through leaves and windows. A green-scaled lizardfolk monk (male Slaan with bright green scales, lighter throat coloration, wearing practical traveling clothes, intelligent reptilian features with pronounced lizard-like head) shares pressed plant specimens and discusses medicinal herbs from distant southern lands. Across from him, a striking wood elf (female with warm bronze skin, luminous glowing green eyes, long flowing black hair cascading past waist, crowned with living vines featuring small red berries, wearing deep green leaf-woven clothing with athletic build, wooden staff with white flowers nearby) examines the specimens with scientific precision. Between them, botanical reference books, dried herbs, sketch journals showing plant anatomy, tools of scholarly research. Their body language suggests deepening friendship through shared passion for understanding living systems. Natural materials throughout the interior - woven furniture, hanging plants, shelves of specimens and books. The scene captures moment of genuine intellectual connection between two researchers from vastly different cultures finding common ground in botanical knowledge. Art style: warm, intimate lighting emphasizing scholarly atmosphere, detailed naturalistic rendering, painterly quality suggesting academic illustration meets fantasy portraiture.
