# The Monk Strikes the Necromancer

## Prompt

```
Epic fantasy digital painting, dynamic action scene of a green-scaled lizardfolk monk (male Slaan with bright green scales, wearing simple traveling clothes, wielding a bo staff) mid-leap from a Gothic mansion's ornate windowsill toward a second-floor balcony where a necromancer in tattered black robes weaves dark magic, purple energy crackling from his hands. Below, hordes of small undead goblins (skeps) swarm the mansion grounds while the monk's companions engage in fierce combat - a scarred dwarf warrior with glowing tattoos, an elderly chef casting needle-like magical projectiles from his outstretched hands, and a pale dhampir woman wielding a medieval hand crossbow (small mechanical bolt-shooting weapon with traditional crossbow design). The three-story Gothic mansion features imported stone and elaborate Astorian architecture on its island setting, surrounded by water. Dramatic lighting with necromantic purple energy contrasting against bright daylight, dynamic composition showing the monk's acrobatic leap frozen in time. Art style: high action, dynamic poses, fantasy adventure art. Wide angle emphasizing both the aerial acrobatics and ground combat.

```
