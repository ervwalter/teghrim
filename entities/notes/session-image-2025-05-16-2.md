# The Call for Aid Answered

## Prompt

```
Epic fantasy digital painting, a mysterious eagle-like winged creature bursts from dark forest canopy, swooping over a desperate battle scene where a weathered Norn wanderer (tall male human with white skin, practical traveling clothes, evil eye talisman visible) extends one hand skyward while casting needle-like magical projectiles with the other. Below, a green-scaled reptilian monk (male Slaan with jade-colored scales, simple robes, bo staff) lies unconscious as a pale dhampir woman (female with aristocratic bearing, leather armor, hand crossbow) drives her blade through a massive orc's eye. The creature's form remains indistinct and shadowy, more suggestion than detail, its presence creating ripples in the air. Moonlight catches on scattered weapons and blood. Art style: atmospheric, mysterious, painterly with dramatic lighting, ArtStation quality. Mid-angle shot capturing the supernatural intervention.

```
