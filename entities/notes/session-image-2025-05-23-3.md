# Breaking the Spider's Web

## Prompt

```
Epic fantasy digital painting, intense rescue scene as heroes cut through massive spider webs to free a trapped dryad (female tree spirit with bark-brown skin, wrapped in thick webbing between two posts). A green-scaled monk (male Slaan with jade scales, hands glowing with inner fire) burns through webs while a scarred dwarf warrior (male dwarf with iron-gray beard, ritual scars, massive maul) crushes a skull-marked spider. An elderly wild-haired man (human male, weathered leather, wielding a flaming torch on a pole) fights off red spiders. In the background, a wood elf woman (female elf with thorn-woven cloak) slashes through webs with her blade. The Great Willow looms overhead, its branches reaching toward its guardian. Spiderwebs catch firelight and moonlight in geometric patterns. A dying spriggan falls in the background. Art style: dynamic action, dramatic lighting with fire and magic, detailed textures on webs and bark, ArtStation quality. Wide action shot capturing the climactic rescue.

```
