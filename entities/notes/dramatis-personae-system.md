# Dramatis Personae System

## Overview

The Dramatis Personae system is a core campaign mechanic that distinguishes between major NPCs (Dramatis Personae) and all other NPCs (Lesser Dramatis Personae). This system creates meaningful social progression mechanics tied to character advancement and skill acquisition.

## Definition and Classification

- **Dramatis Personae**: A select group of major NPCs who are considered "main characters" of the campaign world
- **Lesser Dramatis Personae**: All other NPCs in the campaign

## Relationship Progression

All Dramatis Personae begin with a **neutral attitude** toward party members. Relationships can advance through four stages:

1. **Neutral** (starting relationship)
2. **Friend** (available at level 2+)
3. **Good Friend** (available at level 5+)
4. **Best Friend** (available at level 8+)

### Advancement Mechanics

- **Spending Time**: Players can spend downtime days with Dramatis Personae to learn about them (likes, dislikes, languages, skills they can teach)
- **Action Token Investment**: Starting at level 2, players can spend an Action Token to attempt improving their standing
- **Bonus System**: Receive +1 for each downtime day spent with the target Dramatis Personae (up to +3 maximum)
- **Failure Handling**: Failed attempts don't consume the Action Token, but any accumulated bonus resets

## Relationship Limits

- **Friends**: Players can befriend ALL Dramatis Personae
- **Good Friends**: Players can have only ONE Good Friend
- **Best Friends**: Players can have only ONE Best Friend
- **Group Requirement**: Each Dramatis Personae should be friends with at least one party member

## Skill Point Rewards

Players earn skill points for relationship milestones:

- **First Friend**: 1 skill point
- **First Good Friend**: 1 skill point
- **First Best Friend**: 1 skill point

### Skill Point Usage

Skill points can be spent to learn:

- **Bonus Language** (once only)
- **Bonus Lore Skill** (once only)
- **Bonus Archetype Feat** (once only)

**Requirements**: Must find a Dramatis Personae who can teach the desired skill AND who considers you at least a friend.

## Secrets Mechanic

Each Dramatis Personae has a personal secret (flaw, traumatic past, shame, etc.). Starting at level 6, players with a Good Friend can attempt to guess their secret. Once learned, players can attempt to do something meaningful for that Dramatis Personae.

## Campaign Integration

The system encourages players to:

- Engage socially with major NPCs
- Spend downtime meaningfully
- Develop long-term character relationships
- Pursue specialized training and knowledge
- Invest in the campaign world's social fabric

## Tagging Guidelines

- **Entity Files**: Tag confirmed Dramatis Personae with "Dramatis Personae"
- **Lesser NPCs**: Do not tag with any Dramatis Personae designation
- **Identification**: Major story-relevant NPCs with teaching potential are likely Dramatis Personae
- **Player Agency**: The system assumes players will identify and pursue relationships with these key figures

## Examples from Current Campaign

Based on session events, likely Dramatis Personae candidates include:

- **Lyn Chong**: Spiritual teacher from Jade Kingdoms, offers unique cultural knowledge
- **Sylvia Mournhold**: Noble with family connections and martial expertise
- NPCs with significant screen time, teaching abilities, or ongoing plot relevance

This system transforms NPCs from quest-givers into meaningful relationships that enhance character development and provide mechanical benefits.
