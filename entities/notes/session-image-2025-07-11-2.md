# The Fallen Daughter's Wrath

## Prompt

```
Epic fantasy digital painting, a corrupted young woman emerges from swirling red mist at the center of a glowing Diablo ritual circle, her form partially obscured by supernatural crimson fog but eyes burning with pure hatred. Annie (young human woman transformed by dark magic) stands within the blazing sigil as bloody chains erupt from the ground around her, seeking hearts with demonic hunger. The ritual circle pulses with unholy light, surrounded by arranged orc corpses in theological patterns. In the background, scarecrows with blood-red flame crowns shamble forward from hay bales, their supernatural fire casting dancing shadows. The abandoned farm's burnt wheat field stretches to dark forest edges where drums echo ominously. Hellish red lighting dominates the scene with deep shadows, vertical composition emphasizing the chains rising from infernal depths.
```
