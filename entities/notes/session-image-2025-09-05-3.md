# The Orc Moot Gathering

## Prompt

```
Epic fantasy digital painting, atmospheric wide shot of massive tribal gathering in deep forest clearing. Five battle-worn adventurers stand at center surrounded by hundreds of orcs and goblins in traditional moot assembly: a dwarven slayer (male dwarf with white braided beard, bare scarred torso, red glowing eyes, massive warhammer), an elderly human chef (wild white hair, weathered face, leather vest, wooden staff), a green-scaled lizardfolk monk (Slaan with bright green reptilian scales, bo staff, practical armor), a pale dhampir woman (crimson eyes, black bob haircut, gothic leather jacket, rapier), and a Norn spellcaster (male human with long dark hair, well-groomed beard, elaborate blue Nordic clothing with gold mystical symbols, bird skull pendant). Tribal war drums in foreground. Orcs of varying sizes displaying traditional gear and weapons, some showing respect, others hostile curiosity. Wild goblins (slimy Tolkien-esque creatures with fanboy expressions) clustered at edges. Ritual combat ground marked with tribal symbols. Dense forest canopy overhead filtering afternoon light, smoke from cooking fires drifting through scene. Palpable tension between cultural exchange and potential violence. Art style: detailed environmental storytelling, cinematic scope, painterly realism, emphasizing cultural contrast between civilized heroes and tribal gathering. Atmospheric lighting with dappled forest sunlight, tribal aesthetic details throughout.
