# Iridessa's Tea-Soaked Entrance

## Prompt

```
Epic fantasy digital painting, a tiny pink fairy (female fairy with luminous pink coloring and gossamer wings) bursts through a rustic tavern doorway trailing droplets of bergamot tea that sparkle in morning light, worried expression on her delicate features as she frantically searches the crowded room. Half-eaten breakfasts on wooden tables, a pale woman (female with porcelain skin, black bob haircut with straight bangs, dark leather jacket) looks up with raised eyebrow, a bearded man (male human with long dark hair, elaborate blue clothing with golden mystical symbols) studies table grain intently, and a sturdy dwarf warrior (male dwarf with white braided beard, leather armor vest, weathered appearance) methodically eats from his tankard. Warm tavern interior with wooden beams and morning sunlight streaming through windows, creating contrast with the fairy's glowing presence. Fantasy art style, dynamic composition emphasizing the fairy's urgent motion and the adventurers' varied reactions.
```
