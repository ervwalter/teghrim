# Highland Marsh Melee

## Prompt

```
Epic fantasy digital painting, chaotic three-way battlefield in marshy highland terrain. Multiple giant frogs with glistening amphibian skin stretch their massive fifteen-foot tongues toward adventurers, while enormous flies with iridescent wings dive-bomb massive beetles with chitinous armor plating. At the center, three heroes fight desperately - a green-scaled lizardfolk monk (male Slaan with bright green scales, leather armor, currently grabbed by frog tongue, bo staff raised defensively), a Norse witch (male human with long dark hair, elaborate blue clothing with mystical symbols, hands weaving sonic magic that affects multiple creatures), and a chef-warrior (elderly human with wild white hair, leather vest, wooden staff firing needle projectiles). The marsh environment shows twisted vegetation, murky water, and supernatural mist. Creatures are attacking each other as much as the party, creating tactical chaos. Dynamic lighting from filtered sunlight through highland mist, emphasizing the wet, dangerous terrain and multiple combat encounters happening simultaneously. Art style: detailed fantasy battle scene with emphasis on environmental hazards and multi-species conflict. Wide action composition showing the complex tactical situation.
```
