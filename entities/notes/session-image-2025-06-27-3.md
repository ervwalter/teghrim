# Annie's Final Stand

## Prompt

```
Epic fantasy digital painting, corrupted farm girl standing at the center of a demonic ritual circle in a burning wheat field, Annie (young woman shrouded in swirling red mist, face twisted with hatred and grief, dark magic crackling around her hands), surrounded by animated scarecrows with farming tools as weapons splattered with green orc blood, the ritual circle glowing with Diablo's sigil beneath her feet, multiple dead orcs and goblins scattered around trying to escape or enter the circle, wheat field ablaze with orange flames rising into dark storm clouds, chains of dark energy extending from her hands toward attacking adventurers, expression of bitter rage and divine abandonment on her face. Dark fantasy horror atmosphere, dramatic fire lighting mixed with supernatural red glow.
