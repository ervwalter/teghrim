# The Monk's Declaration

## Prompt

```
Epic fantasy digital painting, a green-scaled lizardfolk monk (male Slaan with bright green scales, lighter coloration on snout and throat, wearing practical leather armor with multiple straps) stands in dynamic combat pose, his bo staff raised high after striking down a scarred orc leader in a burning wheat field. "I am Qotal!" he declares with absolute confidence as smoke rises from ritual fires behind him. His reptilian features - pronounced lizard head with sharp intelligent eyes and pointed teeth - are illuminated by flickering orange firelight. Around the edges of the frame, dozens of orc and goblin spectators lean in with excited interest, some pointing and wagering on the combat. The abandoned farm's stone walls provide a grim backdrop while crimson ritual sigils glow faintly in the scorched earth. Dynamic lighting with dramatic shadows, heroic low angle composition emphasizing the monk's athletic prowess and warrior pride.
```
