# The Bulvak Leader's Grasp

## Prompt

```
Epic fantasy digital painting, intense combat scene as a massive bulvak demon (seven-foot humanoid with corrupted muscle, backward-sweeping horns, demonic features) lifts a green-scaled lizardfolk monk (male Slaan with bright green scales, lighter throat coloring, leather armor with straps) in crushing grasp while attempting to gore with horns, the monk's body twisting like water to escape, forest clearing strewn with battle debris, a dhampir investigator (female with pale skin, black bob hair, leather jacket) fires crossbow bolt into the creature's shoulder drawing dark blood, a wild-haired chef (elderly male human with white unruly hair, leather vest) swings massive maul in measured arc, smaller bulvaks visible in background defending their leader, beaten human prisoners tied with ropes visible at clearing's edge, dynamic action with motion blur on strikes. Dramatic lighting with dappled forest shadows, visceral combat energy. Low angle emphasizing the bulvak's imposing size.
