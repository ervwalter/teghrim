# The Slayer's Fury at the Broken Gate

## Prompt

```
Epic fantasy digital painting, a scarred dwarven warrior (male dwarf with iron-gray beard, bare torso covered in ritual scars and glowing blue-white tattoos, wielding a massive two-handed maul) stands defiantly in a broken gateway as a hulking orc (massive green-skinned orc in crude armor with enormous maul) charges through shattered chains and splintered wood, goblin raiders pouring in behind. The dwarf's tattoos pulse with berserker rage, illuminating the scene with ethereal light. Defensive wooden stakes frame the entrance, some painted with fresh goblin blood. Moonlight streams through the breach contrasting with the supernatural glow. Dark forest looms beyond. Art style: detailed, painterly, dynamic action pose, ArtStation quality. Wide shot emphasizing the collision of forces at the threshold.

```
