# Dwarven Warrior Recognition

## Prompt

```
Epic fantasy digital painting, two dwarven warriors sharing a moment of brotherhood after intense sparring practice in a frontier military training ground. In the center, a white-bearded dwarven slayer (male Highland dwarf with impressive white beard flowing to his chest, bare muscular torso displaying ritual battle scars, wearing minimal leather bracers and fur-trimmed boots, massive warhammer "Old Bessie" nearby) clasps hands with a Highland dwarf captain (male dwarf with rich brown hair past shoulders, long beard reaching nearly to belt, wearing quilted teal armor over leather with dwarven face decorations on belt). Both breathing hard and grinning, sweat glistening on their faces, surrounded by defensive training equipment and wooden stakes. Background shows other Highland dwarf guards observing respectfully. Morning sunlight illuminates the scene with golden warmth, emphasizing the genuine recognition between kindred spirits and the military precision of the frontier settlement. Art style: detailed fantasy realism, ArtStation quality. Close-up composition focusing on the handshake and mutual respect between warriors.
