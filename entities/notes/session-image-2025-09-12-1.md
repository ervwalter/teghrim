```
Epic fantasy digital painting, massive dire boar charging through forest underbrush with terrifying speed, tusks gore a female dhampir investigator (porcelain-pale skin, crimson eyes, sleek black bob haircut with straight bangs, gothic punk outfit with black leather jacket and corsets, holding rapier) who is thrown backward by the impact, blood spattering as she crashes to the forest floor gasping for breath, matted bristled fur over thick muscular hide, tusks long as daggers curving from bone-crushing jaws, other adventurers visible in background reacting to the sudden violence, dappled forest sunlight filtering through canopy, dramatic action composition emphasizing the boar's brutal momentum and the dhampir's vulnerable position, debris and leaves flying from impact. Art style: detailed, visceral, high-contrast lighting, ArtStation quality. Dynamic diagonal composition capturing peak moment of violent collision.
```
