# Alrik's Divine Healing

## Prompt

```
Epic fantasy digital painting, intense healing magic scene in dark forest battle, an elderly chef-turned-adventurer (wild white hair like storm clouds, deeply wrinkled face, worn leather vest over white shirt, wooden staff) channeling brilliant golden divine light from his hands, simultaneously healing a fallen Norn companion (male human with long dark hair, bloodied blue Nordic clothing) while the holy radiance sears the flesh of a towering undead jailor (twenty-foot skeletal giant with iron cage chest containing victims, wrapped in chains), the divine energy creating dramatic contrast between healing warmth and burning judgment, forest shadows dancing from the magical illumination, desperate determination on the healer's weathered face. Cinematic lighting with golden divine glow as primary light source.

```

In a desperate moment with Arnor fallen and the Jailor overwhelming them, Alrik channels divine power to both heal his companion and damage the undead creature, demonstrating the dual nature of holy magic.
