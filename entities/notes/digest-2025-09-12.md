## Chronological Events

### Downtime and Planning (AO34)

1. **RECAP**: Session begins with Craig recapping downtime activities from before recording started
   - Qotal built house with Aelysh
   - Aurelia befriended Gaz
   - Alrik worked with Irka
   - Arnor built secret witch cult
   - Bruldin talked with Gierr and Irka, became friends with Gierr
   - Party sold loot and made money
   - Players confirm this is AO34 (Aestra-Orpheus 34th)

2. **ACTION**: Alrik attempts to befriend Irka using performance skill (dwarven poetry)
   - Rolls 18, fails to meet DC
   - Irka appreciates dwarven poetry but performance isn't his preferred skill
   - Alrik can try again another day

3. **ACTION**: Aurelia spends third day with Gaz and successfully becomes friends using Society skill
   - Rolls 24, succeeds
   - Gaz now considers Aurelia a friend
   - **DISCOVERY**: Gaz complains that the thing on her arm has now bitten a few other goblin friends
   - GM explicitly mentions this is "Chekhov's Gun" - will be important later

4. **NPC**: Aurelia gains friend benefit from Gaz
   - "She knows a guy" who can repair/maintain runes and weapons for free, waiving all fees

5. **DIALOGUE**: Arnor mentions spending day with Osanna to get her opinion on necromancer discoveries
   - Arnor rolls 27 (later corrected to 17) on Society check with Osanna

6. **DISCOVERY**: Arnor learns Osanna dislikes arcane magic
   - Complains about "hoity-toity wizards" and their towers and superior attitudes

7. **LORE**: Osanna provides extensive information about the Necarch organization when Arnor shares party's dungeon discoveries:
   - Osanna: "There are several powers. The Necarch are one of the major ones, along with, you know, my clan."
   - Osanna: "There's a very tenuous relationship between... The vampire clans don't always get along and they do occasionally fight."
   - Osanna: "The vampire elder, um, who's awake helps keep that balance, keeps them from being at each other's throat."
   - Osanna: "Their leader right now is Viktor, who is von Carstein. He's the founder of the von Carstein line."
   - Osanna warns this is "very concerning" - Necarch not known to operate outside Astoria
   - **LORE**: Necarch are heavily into arcane magic, love experimenting, love modifying themselves
   - Necarch often don't look natural anymore - gave example of one with no eyes and horns, very Pan's Labyrinth-like
   - **CREATURE**: Strigoi are vampires that serve the Necarch - also heavily morphed, don't look human, have weird features and morphed faces

8. **LORE**: Osanna explains limitations on her help:
   - Osanna: "Since she is von Carstein, she'll be very limited in what she can do or help you with, 'cause as the member representative of... the relationships between the von Carstein and the Necarch are very tenuous."
   - Asks party to share anything they learn as her bloodline would be very interested
   - Skull cave and Jailor capturing slaves for experiments is "not uncommon" for Necarch
   - Soul well concept is unknown to her - if party learns why they're doing it, would be valuable intelligence

9. **LORE**: GM explains friend secret mechanic:
   - At level 5, can become "good friends" with NPCs
   - Each NPC has a secret that can be discovered
   - If you guess the secret correctly during a day spent with them, you learn it
   - Can then do something nice related to the secret to potentially gain special boon (unique weapon, special power, etc.)
   - Osanna has two secrets (more than anyone else)
   - Secrets will be hinted at subtly as you spend time with NPCs

10. **SCENE**: Next morning (still AO34), party prepares for breakfast

11. **ACTION**: Alrik had another rough night on the bridge

    - Players recall the one-eyed creature quest
    - Kent remembers they talked to Aelysh about it

13. **RECAP**: Party recalls Aelysh's advice about the one-eyed creature:
    - Aelysh said to visit a dryad grove
    - It's the same dryad they rescued from spiders in session 2
    - Dryads originally lived in Aelysh's grove but moved to a different location
    - The one-eyed creature is "a natural spirit but it's not the same natural spirits that are around here"
    - Craig references Princess Mononoke - there are many little forest spirits (not fey, but nature spirits)
    - The one-eyed creature is "of nature" but different from local spirits
    - Aelysh believed the dryads would know more about it

14. **LORE**: Craig explains nature spirits in this world:
    - There are "little forced weird little creatures and spirits" like in Princess Mononoke
    - They're not fey, but exist around the area
    - Various appearances and types
    - [AMBIGUITY: Erv mentions "Leshy" but unclear if that's what these are called]

    - Qotal: "I know they're not acting like they're supposed to."

    - But the Espada should have left long ago
    - Hasn't been seen for quite some time

78. **LORE**: Explanation of time perception and the Breath
    - Forest-born like dryads don't count time beyond a season or two
    - The pulses/breaths are called "breath because it's like nature is exhaling a bunch of energy"
    - Usually very regular intervals
    - Dryad doesn't know how many seasons between breaths
    - Suggests Aelysh could help figure out years between pulses

    - Dryad surprised emanations still present
    - "That seems quite odd."

80. **DIALOGUE**: Party asks where Espada stayed

    - Ley lines aren't straight - they arc and move like energy does
    - Nexus is in a geographic area but tends to change
    - Located "in this vicinity, more so in these upper regions"
    - "I would perhaps look up there"
    - Dryad spoke with the Espada before, knew she was from that area

82. **LOCATION**: Clarification of "up" direction
    - Party confused about "up" - mountain top or north?
    - Dryad means elevated terrain, not map direction
    - "Up north or south of the waterfall"
    - Points to higher waterfall region
    - The elevated plateau area

83. **DISCOVERY**: Party realizes connection to previous exploration
    - Qotal: "Yeah, where we were before."
    - Bruldin: "We just bare- we just barely eked our way in there."
    - References their previous visit to waterfall area

84. **LORE**: Additional information about Genovian the Espada
    - Name: Genovian
    - Related to mist (consistent with one-eyed creature's abilities)
    - Highly related to elements but not true elementals
    - Associated with positive nexus (negative nexus is far south across mountain range)

85. **DIALOGUE**: Player discussion (OOC) about geography - Astoria is south across Himalaya-like mountain range, approximately 5+ hexes away

86. **LORE**: Genovian also referred to as a "Rhonqar"
    - Dryad: "Generally she referred to as a Rhonqar, which you'll also get that, but only by name"
    - Qotal gets this name by recognition only
    - Described as "a fairly kind person"

87. **NPC**: Willow Dryad summons small forest creature (leshy-type with white face mask) that sings a tune
    - Plays mystical song that Genovian taught young forest creatures

88. **SCENE**: Willow Dryad expresses concern about something wrong in the forest
    - Dryad: "I have felt much wrong. Um, I can't tell from where... the wind still tastes the same... brooks still sing as they should, but something is wrong and I can't put my finger on it"
    - Doesn't know if related to one-eyed creature situation

89. **NPC**: Willow Dryad suggests alternative - party could speak to old tree ent in Enchanted Forest
    - Location: South/southeast of Willow Glade, other side of road
    - Tree ent would know exactly where Genovian lived
    - Might have sensed whatever is bothering Dryad

90. **LORE**: Willow Dryad warns Enchanted Forest is highly dangerous for "mortal-born"
    - Contains highly dangerous natural primal presences

     - Both attacks hit successfully
     - Combined damage: 28 bludgeoning (added together due to flurry)

     - GM confirms it's a straight check
     - 14 is not enough to dispel the smoke
     - GM clarifies it's two actions and can only be done once per casting

153. **COMBAT**: Aurelia shoots at concealed tree
     - Must roll extra D20 for concealment
     - Rolls both dice simultaneously - one natural 20 and one lower roll (12)
     - Confusion about which die is the attack roll
     - GM has Aurelia roll D6 to determine which was attack: 4-6 means the crit was the attack
