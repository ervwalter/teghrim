### Gierr's Morning Visit and New Quest Hook (Aestra-Orpheus 31st)
**[00:44:55-00:46:40]** - **SCENE**: Early morning at Teghrim's Crossing. Gierr Bjornson comes to see party. Gets his usual breakfast, visits Sigrid (his niece). She nags him - needs to come up more, socialize, get out of the bushes, take a bath, stop playing with bees

**[00:45:38-00:46:02]** - **LORE**: Gierr has been busy with his hives, having problems with invasive large wasps

**[00:46:02-00:47:10]** - **QUEST HOOK**: Gierr mentions party did mission at old farmstead about week or two ago (Annie's farm - where orcs killed family, woman sold soul to Diablo for powers, was raising straw creatures). During that fight, party entertained orcs enough that orcs thought they were cool and let them leave without trouble

**[00:47:10-00:47:40]** - **DISCOVERY**: Gierr saw something weird in that vicinity during his walkabouts - starting to hear distant drums, saw smoke rising from area of old farm. Smoke and drums suggest orc activity

**[00:47:40]** - **QUEST**: Gierr asks party to explore rest of that hex square and check out what's going on with the smoke

### Hex Exploration: Old Farmstead Area
**[00:47:40-00:48:40]** - **SCENE**: Party travels to old farmstead area east of Teghrim's Crossing. Farmstead still intact. New plants sprouting where party had burnt grass. Buildings still standing. Things have tried to move into buildings - maybe goblins or forest critters. Periodically hear noises in distance - drumbeat or large grunt

**[00:48:40-00:49:30]** - **MECHANICS**: Party begins exploring hex with activity declarations: Scouting (detect magic), stealth, searching. Party travels at moderate pace on grid pattern

**[00:49:18-00:49:31]** - **ACTION**: Perception rolls. Aurelia 27, hears noises clearly with elf ears - grunts, talking off in distance coming from all over the place. Can't quite make out what's being said

**[00:49:31-00:50:14]** - **ACTION**: Bruldin survival check 14 → Recognizes orc and goblin tracks. Hunting or scouting parties went through very recently. Bruldin speaks Orc language (just decided to take that feat) and is familiar with orc/goblin signs

### Orc Encounter and Warning Shot
**[00:50:22-00:51:21]** - **COMBAT PREP**: Aurelia perception 20 → Sees moments before it happens - orc in elevated position in tree shoots bow and arrow NOT at party but as warning shot. Arrow lands in tree right in front of party (attention-getter)

**[00:51:21-00:52:24]** - **SCENE**: Orc hops down from tree and approaches party. Sounds a small horn. Soon more orcs and goblins start coming out. Orc has weapon drawn but doesn't look overly aggressive

**[00:52:05-00:52:24]** - **DIALOGUE**: Bruldin in Orc: "Hail Lord Mighty Orc." GM: "This is Teghrim's Crossing, speak common."

**[00:52:24-00:53:16]** - **LORE**: GM explains language mechanics. Common is "toilet speak language" - no one likes it because it's basic and inelegant. Speaking native language gives bonuses to diplomacy (lower DCs) because you're being respectful. Speaking Common can increase DCs. Speaking native language might overcome diplomacy deficit - better to speak native language without diplomacy skill than have diplomacy but not speak their language

**[00:54:25-00:56:09]** - **DIALOGUE**: Lead orc approaches speaking in Orc, gives proper orcish greeting (mostly an insult - normal orc culture). Bruldin insults him back properly. Orc: "You the humies that fought at the farm?" Bruldin: "Aye, that's us. We kicked some ass." Orc: "We remembers you. So are you here to see the orc moot?" Bruldin: "Well, we weren't sure what was going on. We saw the smoke... if there's an orc moot, that sounds like fun."

**[00:56:09-00:57:04]** - **LORE**: Bruldin society roll 16 → Orc moot is gathering of orc tribes (and goblins to lesser extent). When living in small tribes, tribes periodically come together to gather and meet. Normally most people would NOT be allowed at such a thing. Party gained respect from entertaining fight performance, which is why they're being allowed. This is an opportunity

**[00:57:04-00:57:40]** - **DIALOGUE**: Bruldin: "When does the orc moot gonna occur?" Orc: "Oh, it ongoing... They may be gathering soon. If you come if you wanna watch." Bruldin: "Sure. Where's it at?" Orc: "Come. You, uh, unscented humies come follow us."

**[00:58:02-00:58:14]** - **DIALOGUE**: Bruldin translates for party: "We're gonna go to orc moot. Find out what's going on in this area. They're all gathered. What better way to find out what's happening than direct to the source... Hopefully they don't eat us."

### Journey to Orc Moot
**[00:58:14-01:00:00]** - **SCENE**: Party marches with orcs into forest. As they travel, orcs growing in density. Party definitely getting attention - everyone else is orcs and goblins. Some orcs had seen party fight before and are interested. Others are like "What are you doing here?"

**[00:58:27-00:58:51]** - **LORE**: Goblins described as Tolkien goblins - mouths all slimy and drooly, very uncouth. Orcs more amenable to party. Goblins looking at party hungrily - not sure if fanboying or thinking party is dinner (maybe both)

**[00:58:51-01:00:32]** - **SCENE**: Party reaches area where tribes are gathering. Large orc comes up, starts talking to orc escort. Large orc: "Well, what them doing here? Ugly humies not supposed to be here. Dwarf, why dwarf, other guys, un-smelly people, they not welcome. They not welcome. They must go... They must prove themself." Cheer goes up among crowd. Orcs and goblins start gathering around party, shouting "test, test, prove, prove" and "fight, fight, fight"

**[01:00:32-01:00:39]** - **DIALOGUE**: Original orc escort: "If you stay, you must show you worthy."

### Verbal Sparring and Challenge
**[01:00:39-01:01:30]** - **DIALOGUE**: Bruldin: "How do we know you're worthy? We've proven our mettle fighting the demon and the farm. What have you done?" Orc: "You fight weak demon, that nothing. Me stronger." Bruldin: "You're smellier." Orc: "Not true. Good smell. Me got musk."

**[01:01:02-01:01:34]** - **DIALOGUE**: Bruldin mentions the Collector: "We defeated the collector. What have you done?" Orc: "Collector, bah. Me no normal collector." Bruldin: "You know the giant thing with the cage in its chest, roaming the forest, turning people into flayed sides of beef?"

**[01:01:34-01:03:33]** - **SKILL**: Bruldin uses society to impress → Roll 16 → Result good enough that it doesn't impress the large orc or close associates, but DOES impress some goblins and smaller orcs. Some recognize the Collector and actually fear it. Bruldin: "We have its whip!" (GM clarifies they have the rune, not the actual huge whip)

**[01:03:33-01:06:13]** - **SCENE**: Huge gaggle of orcs and goblins come out hearing the chanting. Drums start suddenly. They're anxious to see a fight. GM calls for society/nature rolls. Alrik 15, Arnor natural 29, someone else 19. GM explains: In a fight like this, orcs fight to the death all the time. If party loses, orcs will probably kill them. If party kills the orcs, they probably don't care - won't lose points for it. Many orcs and goblins circling like previous farm fight, looking for good show

### Pizazz Combat Mechanic Explained
**[01:06:13-01:07:07]** - **MECHANIC**: GM explains "pizazz" system (not panache). Once per round as free action, can declare next action is "pizazz action." Make attack - if hit, then choose different skill and describe how making attack with pizazz. Example: Making weapon attack, say "I'm using my arcane for pizazz" - as swinging sword, sparks of lightning go off. Then roll arcana check. Depending on roll, score points with orcs to show you're cool. Only do pizazz once per round. Must choose to use pizazz BEFORE making attack/casting spell. Must be different skill than what you're using for the action. Get more points if you win

### Combat: Gladiatorial Arena Fight

## Technical Notes
- **Session Title**: "The Orc Moot" (confirmed by GM at end)
- **Late Arrival**: Erv/Qotal arrived late, joined during gladiatorial combat (approximately halfway through session)
- **In-Game Date**: Aestra-Orpheus 30th-31st (two days covered)
- **System**: Pathfinder 2e with custom "pizazz" mechanic for gladiatorial combat
- **Pizazz Mechanic**: Once per round free action to declare action with flair, must use different skill than action skill, earns points with orc spectators based on roll
- **Language Mechanics**: Speaking native language provides significant diplomatic bonuses, Common is "toilet speak" nobody likes
- **Name Standardizations**: Speaker numbers converted to character names where identifiable (Erv=Qotal, Kent=Alrik, Michael=Bruldin, Matt=Arnor, Katie=Aurelia). Some "Castor" references likely mean generic "caster" term
- **Real-World Context**: Kent announced wedding date October 4th, 2026 (eloping in 2025)
- **Party Resources**: Heavy resource expenditure in previous session (Skull Rock), party mostly recovered by this session
- **Level Status**: Party at level 4, approaching level 5 (armor rune story requirement mentioned)
- **Transcription Notes**: Some proper names in correspondence may have transcription errors (Goldgrin confirmed, other names uncertain)
