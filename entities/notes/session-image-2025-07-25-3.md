# Aurelia's Revelation

## Prompt

```
Epic fantasy digital painting, dramatic moment of trust and revelation in a dark oppressive forest clearing scattered with fallen leaves and twisted undergrowth. A pale dhampir investigator (female with porcelain-pale skin, crimson eyes, sleek black bob hair with straight bangs, dark lipstick, wearing black leather jacket over elaborate gothic corsets and straps, golden-scaled armor pieces, skull pendant choker) lies wounded among forest detritus but conscious, looking up with weary honesty at her concerned companions. A bearded Norn wizard (male human with long dark hair past shoulders, well-groomed beard, elaborate Nordic blue clothing with golden mystical symbols, bird skull pendant) kneels beside her with genuine concern. Nearby, a massive undead bear corpse with bones protruding through blackened fur lies still. The atmosphere is heavy with corruption and supernatural malevolence, filtered sunlight creating eerie shadows. Art style: dark fantasy realism with Gothic undertones. Close-up composition focusing on Aurelia's vulnerable moment of truth.
