# The Norn's Moon Ceremony

## Prompt

```
Epic fantasy digital painting, a mystical Nordic shaman (male human with long dark hair, well-groomed beard, wearing elaborate blue clothing with golden Viking compass symbols, bird skull pendant on leather cord) raises his arms in ancient ritual beneath a waning gibbous moon, sacred forest clearing bathed in silver moonlight, a trash griffin familiar (crow-raccoon hybrid creature with black wings and raccoon features) perches on nearby branch watching intently, two companions present - a wild-haired elderly man (male human with unruly white hair, weathered face, leather vest) already asleep and snoring against a tree, and a gothic dhampir woman (female with porcelain-pale skin, black bob haircut, dark lipstick, leather jacket and corsets) standing in shadows appreciating the darkness, mystical energy spiraling upward toward the moon, ancient Norse runes glowing faintly in the air. Dark fantasy atmosphere with ethereal blue-silver lighting, magical realism style. Composition centered on the ritualist with moon overhead.
