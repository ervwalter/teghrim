# Qotal's Final Strike Against the Jailor

## Prompt

```
Epic fantasy digital painting, climactic moment of combat in massive underground dungeon chamber with jail cells lining the walls. A green-scaled lizardfolk monk (male Slaan with bright green scales, lighter coloration on snout and throat, wearing practical leather armor with straps and buckles, wielding bo staff) drives his staff deep into the chest cavity of a colossal twenty-foot-tall undead construct, the massive creature collapsing forward as bones crack audibly. The Jailor (skeletal emaciated giant draped in tattered robes and chains, skull-like head with curved horns, massive empty iron cage built into its ribcage visible through decaying flesh, greenish-pale coloration) shudders as the staff penetrates the bone cage, ribs shattering under the impact. Behind the monk, a scarred dwarven slayer (male dwarf with white braided beard, bare muscular torso covered in ritual scars, wielding massive maul) stands ready, while a Norn spellcaster (male human with long dark hair, well-groomed beard, elaborate blue Nordic clothing with golden mystical symbols, bird skull pendant) and elderly human chef (wild white hair like storm clouds, weathered face, worn leather vest over simple shirt, wooden staff) provide support. Torchlight casts dramatic shadows across dungeon stone walls, orange and amber illumination contrasting with the construct's sickly green decay. Rusted chains and shackles hang from the creature's enormous frame, trailing to the ground. Art style: detailed, painterly, dark fantasy, ArtStation quality. Dynamic composition emphasizing the size difference between monk and massive construct, moment of victory captured as the construct begins its final collapse.
