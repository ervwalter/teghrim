# Spider Snake Ambush in Skull Rock

## Prompt

```
Epic fantasy digital painting, intense dungeon combat scene in wide bedrock tunnel carved for giant creatures. Hybrid spider-snake creatures (serpentine bodies with arachnid features, venomous fangs visible, purple and red colorations, some larger than others) descend on silk threads from dark ceiling holes to strike at adventurers below. Green-scaled lizardfolk monk (male Slaan with bright green scales, lighter coloration on snout, wearing leather armor with multiple straps) recoils from venomous bite, poison visibly affecting him. Elderly chef with wild white hair like storm cloud (male human in worn leather vest, wooden staff) fights defensively. Nordic spellcaster (male human with long dark hair, well-groomed beard, elaborate blue clothing with golden symbols) channels lightning magic. Bare-chested dwarven warrior (male dwarf with white braided beard, scarred muscular torso, wielding massive warhammer) strikes at creature. Small luminous sprite (delicate features, purple-pink hair with flowers, lavender skin) hovers above providing yellow-green light. Oppressive dungeon atmosphere, shadows contrasting with sprite's glow and crackling electricity. Art style: detailed, painterly, ArtStation quality. Dynamic action composition emphasizing the hit-and-run tactics of creatures descending and retreating via silk strands.
