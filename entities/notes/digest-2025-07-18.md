- **Ghost Combat (Echin)**: Party vs Echin's ghost tied to magical mural → Tactical withdrawal after realizing need for different approach
- **Liberation Ritual**: Successful divine ritual to break magical binding holding both spirits → Resolution through investigation, diplomacy, and religious knowledge

## Entities for Extraction

### NPCs

- **Echin**: Human male from legend, deceased for decades. Was infatuated with Midora, brought her to forest ruins with "tales of love" then used magical ritual to bind her spirit to a mural when she didn't reciprocate his feelings. Became a ghost tied to the location, trapped alongside her. Appeared corporeal but was actually a restless spirit. Eliminated when ritual binding was broken and time caught up to him.
- **Midora/Midora**: Human female from legend, victim of Echin's obsessive magical binding. Was brought to forest ruins under false pretenses, then magically trapped for decades. Appeared as cloaked spirit near stone circle. Grateful to party for liberation, departed peacefully after ritual completion. Used wind magic to communicate.

### Locations

- **Storm Investigation Site**: Ancient stone ruins in forest where Midora and Echin disappeared decades ago. Contains crude old building remains, magical mural depicting Midora, stone circles. Site of supernatural storms caused by trapped spirits. Located west of Teghrim's Crossing, requiring day's travel through muddy forest. Supernatural fog with fear effects surrounds the area. Contains cart with ritual components (antique lantern and shovel).

### Quests/Tasks

- **Like Tears in the Rain**: Investigation of recurring supernatural storms plaguing the region. Party discovered storms were caused by trapped spirits of Midora and Echin from decades-old tragedy. Successfully performed divine ritual to break magical binding, freeing both spirits and ending the storms. Participants: Qotal, Aurelia, Alrik, Aelysh. Rewards: Magical javelin of lightning, resolution of regional supernatural threat.

### Organizations

- **Bridge Construction Era**: Historical context from ~40 years ago when Teghrim's Crossing bridge was built. Original commander built mansion on island then left. Houses completed within last 20 years. During this period, Midora and Echin disappeared, starting the recurring storm phenomenon.

## Unresolved Questions

- [AMBIGUITY: Entity linking - relationship between one-eyed creature sightings and the storm spirits unclear]
- [AMBIGUITY: Name consistency - "Midora" vs "Midora" used interchangeably, "Echin" vs "Guy" in some references]
- [AMBIGUITY: Magical javelin power level - GM indicated it may be overpowered for party level and will adjust]

## Technical Notes

- Speaker attribution challenging during combat sequences due to segment concatenation
- Multiple instances of overlapping time ranges between transcript segments
- Names from legend showed spelling variations in transcript (Midora/Midora, Echin/Guy/Eisen)
- Some mechanical uncertainties around ghost resistances and ritual components discussed during play
