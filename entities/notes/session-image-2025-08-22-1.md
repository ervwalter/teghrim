# Osanna's Electrocution at Skull Rock

## Prompt

```
Epic fantasy digital painting, dramatic magical shock scene at cursed stone formation shaped like massive skull. A vampire noble (strikingly beautiful female with porcelain-pale skin, lustrous black curled hair, wearing elegant black and red corset dress with white puffy sleeves, red gemstone earrings) is violently thrown through the air by electrical discharge from ancient pedestal mechanism atop the skull structure. Brilliant arcs of positive energy crackle around her body causing visible pain, her face contorted in genuine agony, hair and dress whipping from the force. Overcast sky with light rain, dark gray stone formation looming below. Four adventurers watch in alarm from base of structure - green-scaled lizardfolk monk (male Slaan with bright green scales, lighter coloration on snout, leather armor), elderly chef with wild white hair (male human wearing worn leather vest over white shirt, wooden staff), handsome Nordic man with long dark hair and beard (male human in elaborate blue clothing with golden mystical symbols, bird skull pendant), and bare-chested dwarf with white braided beard (male dwarf with scarred torso, minimal armor, massive warhammer). Art style: detailed, painterly, dramatic lighting with electrical discharge illuminating the scene. Wide composition showing the violent arc of the vampire's trajectory against stormy sky.
```
