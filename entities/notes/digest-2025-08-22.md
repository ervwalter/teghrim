25. **DISCOVERY**: Lyn reveals collaboration with Rosencrantz on anti-Jailor weapon using ichor from previous fight, expects completion by end of day

### [Time Range: 00:29:11 - 00:50:50] Downtime Activities - Day 1 (Aestra-Orpheus 28th)

30. **PLANNING**: Party decides downtime today, wait for preparations, go tomorrow
31. **PLANNING**: Qotal mentions wanting to befriend: Sylvia, Gierr, or Gaz
32. **ACTION**: Qotal spends downtime day with Gaz using Society check to gossip/gather information → rolls 12 → spends pleasant day but learns nothing new (this is Qotal's second day with her, gets +2 bonus for future checks)
33. **ACTION**: Alrik decides to spend day with Sylvia Mournhold
34. **LORE**: Alrik automatically learns about Sylvia - she's from famous Mournhold military family, comparable to "a Wellington" - well-renowned throughout all Iron Kingdoms
35. **DISCOVERY**: Alrik spends day with Sylvia learning she's poring over maps, picking information from goblins, setting up possible trade routes for mining/finding gems. Two benefits: (1) She's a gem buyer who gives better prices, (2) Like Irka, she'll buy things at slightly better price
36. **ACTION**: Arnor spends time with Gierr doing archery practice (Athletics check) → rolls natural 20 for total of 30 → critical success
37. **DISCOVERY**: Gierr is hunter by profession finding pelts for Ygrid to sell, does scrimshaw carving with bones, raising bees to make Nornish mead. BENEFIT: "Norn Brew" - before every mission, gives free elixir comparable to party level (only lasts for that adventure)
38. **ACTION**: Bruldin's player manages witch activities and time with Sigrid
39. **SCENE**: Day passes uneventfully. Storm clouds move in, rains a bit overnight
40. **LORE**: Alrik has vision from Skuld (Norn deity of future) during spirit communion - sees ravens flying in unusual large flock, hears Skuld chanting. Vision shows giant winged humanoid woman with raven wings flying toward their direction, described as ominous and "not a valkyrie"

### [Time Range: 00:50:50 - 01:09:25] Journey to Skull Rock

41. **SCENE**: Morning of Aestra-Orpheus 29th arrives, still cloudy and slightly rainy
42. **ITEM**: Qotal prepares four lesser elixirs of life using alchemy (gives one each to two party members, keeps two) - basic 1d6 healing for combat emergencies, disappear if unused by end of day
43. **ITEM**: GM explains Lyn and Rosencrantz created three potion bombs using jailor ichor, fine-tuned to work specifically on the jailor. Should confuse construct's simple logic, giving opening for a few rounds. "Make them count, because this is all I could create."
44. **PLANNING**: Qotal volunteers to carry bombs since he has good dexterity for ranged throws
45. **SCENE**: Osanna walks forward slowly toward skull formation. She suddenly starts yelling - party realizes she's pranking them
46. **ACTION**: Osanna climbs around back of skull formation, reaches top where pedestal is located
47. **ACTION**: Osanna presses mechanism on pedestal
48. **COMBAT**: Osanna screams in pain - gets violently zapped by mechanism
49. **PERCEPTION**: Party makes checks - Alrik (25) determines "this sounds real" not another prank
50. **ACTION**: Osanna flies through air from electrical shock, lands unconscious/dazed
51. **DISCOVERY**: The necrotic curse field that party had sensed previously now goes away - field would have triggered vulnerabilities for massive damage (48+ potential)
52. **INVESTIGATION**: Qotal sees actual door inside skull formation when looking with flashlight
53. **DIALOGUE**: Osanna to party before they enter: "Please tell me in detail what you find"
54. **DIALOGUE**: Arnor to Osanna: "I look forward to it. You'll provide the wine." GM: "Blood wine? Plenty."
55. **LORE**: Osanna is whole blood vampire, pretty high level - even at half level would be formidable ally
56. **SCENE**: Door leads to stairway winding down - stairs NOT human-sized, much bigger, designed for large-sized creatures or bigger (jailor would need to fit through)
57. **ATMOSPHERE**: As party descends, area has very oppressive spiritual feeling, almost spiritual drain
58. **DIALOGUE**: Arnor: "Malaise" / "It is cursed. The spirits of this place are dark and dreadful"
59. **DIALOGUE**: Qotal: "This place is not... wholesome. The power of nature is suppressed in this place"
60. **SCENE**: Halls are really wide - tunnel has been carved, NOT natural, NOT dwarven construction
61. **NPC**: Vidia (Alrik's fairy companion) provides light, hovering above party chewing fingernails nervously
62. **DIALOGUE**: Alrik gives Vidia licorice, tells her not to chew fingernails
63. **DIALOGUE**: Alrik: "Whatever is down here does not need light"
64. **SKILL**: Qotal and Bruldin attempt Survival checks (21 and 19) - hard to tell much, walking mostly on bedrock with minimal dust, not enough moisture for clear tracks
65. **DISCOVERY**: Party starts hearing crunching - lots of tiny skeleton bones on ground
66. **SKILL**: Qotal uses Nature check (21) - identifies bones as rodents (rats, mice), fairly small but some decent size
67. **DIALOGUE**: Bruldin: "Are the rodents leaving or coming into cave when they died?"

### [Time Range: 01:09:25 - 01:10:20] Investigation of Skull Mechanism

68. **ACTION**: Party climbs back up to examine pedestal/rune
69. **SKILL**: Arnor uses Arcana check with astrology ability → rolls 17 → learns details about mechanism
70. **DISCOVERY**: Rune pulls from energies very deep within, mechanism easy to use, will turn off and reset in day or two (not hours), field probably just covered area up top, really simple to deactivate and wasn't trapped, linked to something further down
71. **SKILL**: Alrik and Arnor examine Osanna's condition with Medicine checks - Arnor rolls 29
72. **DISCOVERY**: Osanna definitely landed hard with skid mark, was genuinely dazed (not acting like her earlier prank), something interacted with her
73. **THEORY**: Arnor suggests "Maybe when you turn off the thing, it gives short pulse of positive energy" - would explain why it hurt vampire Osanna
74. **CONCLUSION**: Qotal: "So the thing probably didn't kill these rats" / Arnor: "Not intentionally anyway" / Bruldin: "Something else killed them"

## Entities for Extraction

### NPCs
- **Necromancer (Skull Rock Master)**: Large, tall, eyeless creature with horns covering head area. Wears cloak of flayed skins (various creatures, possibly including humans). Speaks Necral and Common. Can raise skeletons from bones through necromantic magic. Mentioned "we" before correcting to "I" suggesting possible collaborators. Controls Skull Rock dungeon. Dragging large pouch/cloth containing unknown contents. Appearance similar to Pan's Labyrinth Pale Man or LOTR Mouth of Sauron.

- **Eris**: Goddess of discord and chaos, keeper of balance alongside Pharasma and Tyrael. Represents necessary chaos. Her followers are Priests of Discord who prevent any faction from becoming too powerful. Symbol found in woods near Teghrim's Crossing suggests priests may be operating in area.

### Locations
- **Skull Rock**: Common name for Cursed Stone Formation, the Jailor's lair. Giant-sized carved tunnel system (not natural, not dwarven). Entrance protected by necrotic curse field controlled by pedestal mechanism on top of skull formation. Field resets in 1-2 days after deactivation. Mechanism pulls energy from deep source, linked to something further down. Tunnels designed for large creatures. Hundreds of rodent skeletons throughout. Strong spiritual oppression/curse atmosphere. Contains spider snake nests in ceiling holes. Large bone chamber with raised platform. Extra-wide door at back of bone chamber. Controlled by powerful necromancer. No light sources - inhabitants don't need light. Connected to Jailor threat but necromancer appears to be separate entity.

### Quests/Tasks
- **Skull Rock Dungeon Expedition**: Party enters Jailor's lair with Osanna's help to investigate threat. Osanna disabled necrotic field but was knocked unconscious by positive energy pulse. Party descended into giant-sized carved tunnels, fought spider snakes and giant rats, discovered necromancer controlling the dungeon. Quest incomplete - party trapped facing skeleton army. Participants: Qotal, Arnor, Alrik, Bruldin. Support: Osanna (disabled field, stayed outside). Stakes: Eliminate Jailor threat, rescue potential victims, understand necromancer's connection to Jailor.

### Organizations
- **Priests of Discord**: Followers of Eris who work to prevent any faction from becoming too powerful. Maintain balance through creating necessary chaos. May be operating near Teghrim's Crossing based on discovered religious medallion.

### Creatures
- **Spider Snakes**: Come in multiple sizes (small and large varieties). Venomous creatures requiring Fortitude saves against poison. Use ceiling holes and silk threads to hide and ambush. Hit-and-run tactics - drop down to attack then pull back up. Without silk strand intact, cannot retreat. Large version (Red) more aggressive, stays in melee. Small versions use guerrilla tactics. Create funnel webs filled with dead bugs, rats, and desiccated prey.

- **Giant Rats**: Standard rats (not undead/bone variants) living in bone pile. Carry disease requiring Fortitude saves (failure causes Clumsy 1 indefinitely until cured). Attack in waves emerging from bone piles. Described as "rat rats" by GM.

- **Raised Skeletons**: Necromantic constructs animated from bone pile by necromancer. Various sizes including one very large skeleton. Ordered to capture party alive if possible.

### Items
- **Anti-Jailor Potion Bombs** (3): Created by Lyn Chong and Rosencrantz using jailor ichor. Fine-tuned to confuse the jailor construct's simple logic for a few rounds. Carried by Qotal. 30-foot radius effect.

- **Lesser Elixirs of Life** (4): Created by Qotal using alchemy. Provide 1d6 healing, alchemical items that disappear at end of day. Distributed among party.

- **Eris Medallion**: Religious symbol of goddess of discord. Not aged or worn, found in woods by Aelysh's familiar. Indicates possible Priests of Discord presence.

- **Norn Brew**: Benefit from befriending Gierr - provides free elixir before each mission comparable to party level, only lasts for that adventure.

### Magic/Curses
- **Necrotic Curse Field**: Protected Skull Rock entrance, triggered vulnerability damage (potential 48+ damage), controlled by pedestal mechanism using rune that pulls from deep energy source, resets in 1-2 days, positive energy pulse when deactivated (harmed vampire Osanna).

- **Disease (from Giant Rats)**: Causes Clumsy 1 indefinitely until cured. Qotal contracted this disease. Aelysh can cure diseases (Lyn Chong cures curses).

- **Spiritual Oppression**: Strong curse/negative spiritual energy throughout Skull Rock tunnels, described as "malaise" and spiritual drain.

## Unresolved Questions
- What was necromancer dragging in the pouch/cloth?
- Who are the "we" necromancer mentioned before correcting to "I"?
- Is necromancer connected to Jailor or separate threat controlling the lair?
- How to open mysterious non-magical stone door?
- What is the deep energy source the rune mechanism draws from?
- What killed all the rodents in tunnel if not the necrotic field?
- Are caravan captives still alive or were they made into the skin cloak?

- Speaker number inconsistencies throughout transcript (corrected in digest)
- Common transcription errors: "Katala" for Qotal, "Rolden" for Bruldin, "Ulric" for Alrik, "Liam" for Lyn Chong, "Dotbig" for Natvig
- Quest location officially named "Skull Rock" by GM at session end
- Katie (Aurelia) returning in September after August absence
