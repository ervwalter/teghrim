# Alrik's Spell Reversal

## Prompt

```
Epic fantasy digital painting, dramatic magical moment in necromantic ritual chamber as divine power disrupts dark energy. An elderly human chef-turned-cleric (male human with wild white hair erupting like storm clouds, weathered face with deep wrinkles, worn leather vest over simple white shirt, raising wooden staff) casts Dispel Magic at precisely the right instant, golden-white divine energy erupting from his staff toward a glowing necromantic orb. The Fleshcrafter (large tall female creature with no visible eyes, horns covering her head, wearing cloak stitched from flayed skins) reaches toward the soul orb as she has throughout the battle, but this time the energy reverses catastrophically - positive energy instead of negative flooding into her form. She recoils and shrieks, mouth open in anguish, her eyeless face contorted in pain as holy light burns through her necromantic framework. Purple-black negative energy transforms to brilliant white-gold positive energy in spectacular magical reversal. Around them, fleshless undead troops (skinned corpses animated as walkers and crawlers) continue shambling across stone chamber. A green-scaled lizardfolk monk (male Slaan with bright green scales, practical leather armor, bo staff), scarred dwarven slayer (male dwarf with white braided beard, bare torso with ritual scars, massive maul), and Norn spellcaster (male human with long dark hair, blue Nordic clothing, bird skull pendant) fight nearby undead while witnessing the decisive spell. Swirling magical energies clash - divine gold versus necromantic purple-black - creating spectacular lighting effects. Art style: detailed, magical battle scene, painterly, dramatic lighting emphasizing energy reversal, ArtStation quality. Composition centered on Alrik's spell striking the orb and the Fleshcrafter's anguished response, capturing the turning point that ends the boss fight.

## Context

This scene depicts the climactic moment when Alrik, despite suffering from stupefied condition due to the necromancer's earlier attack, perfectly times his Dispel Magic to strike when the Fleshcrafter draws power from her soul orb. Rolling a natural 20 despite penalties, his spell reverses the orb's polarity from negative to positive energy. The holy power floods into the necromancer whose entire magical framework expects death energy's corruption, causing her to shriek in genuine distress and flee through a secret door. This brilliant tactical move ends the boss fight and forces her retreat.
