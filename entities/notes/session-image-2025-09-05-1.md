# Champion's Devastating Opening

## Prompt

```
Epic fantasy digital painting, brutal gladiatorial combat in tribal gathering clearing surrounded by hundreds of roaring orcs and goblins. A massive orc champion (towering seven-foot warrior with bulging muscles, scarred green skin, wearing crude armor and wielding enormous maul) strikes with devastating sweeping attack hitting both a dwarven slayer (male dwarf with white braided beard flowing to chest, bare muscular torso covered in ritual scars, red glowing eyes, wielding massive warhammer) and an elderly human chef (wild white hair like storm cloud, weathered face with deep wrinkles, leather vest over simple shirt, wielding wooden staff). Meanwhile three fire-breathing goblins (small slimy creatures with fanboy expressions, carrying alchemical flame bottles) launch waves of fire toward the combatants. Drums pound in background, crowd of hundreds cheers from surrounding forest edge, dust and debris flying from impact. Dramatic action composition emphasizing the champion's overwhelming power and the heroes' desperate defense. Art style: painterly, gritty fantasy, high detail, dynamic motion blur on the sweeping attack, orange flames contrasting with forest shadows. Wide cinematic shot capturing scale of spectator crowd and intensity of combat.
