# Combat as Performance Art

## Prompt

```
Epic fantasy digital painting, wide battlefield view showing adventurers locked in acrobatic combat with flaming scarecrows while dozens of orcs and goblins form an impromptu arena around them, cheering and wagering on the outcome. In the foreground, a pale dhampir woman (Aurelia with porcelain skin, black bob haircut, gothic leather attire) wields a burning torch with gymnastic grace against a straw construct. A wild-haired elderly man (Alrik with white unruly hair like storm clouds) casts glowing needle darts while a handsome Norn man (Arnor with long dark hair, blue Nordic clothing) traces luminous runes in the air. The green-scaled monk (Qotal) flows between enemies with staff spinning. The orc spectators lean in with genuine interest, some exchanging coins, others pointing excitedly at impressive moves. Abandoned farm walls frame the scene while smoke and embers drift across the twilight sky. Dynamic action lighting with multiple light sources from fires and magic, cinematic wide-angle composition capturing both combat and audience.
```

## Context

The moment when the party realizes their battle has become a spectator sport, with orcs and goblins evaluating their combat prowess rather than joining the fight.
