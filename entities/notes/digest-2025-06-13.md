## Entities for Extraction

### NPCs
- **Aelysh**: Wood Elf druid who lives in the woods, has a Leshy familiar that got infected with fungus, working on fungus cure research, provided quest and rewards, not wealthy ("being a druid")
- **Iridessa**: Fairy who found party to deliver Aelysh's request, previously kicked out of dining hall for using tea as bath

### Locations
- **Cave**: Small cave near bridge where fungus infection originated, contained myconid and infected creatures
- **Old Rickety Bridge**: Where rust oozes emerged from below to attack party

### Creatures
- **Rust Oozes** (x2): Emerged from bridge, resistant to steel weapons (cause degradation), vulnerable to lightning magic
- **Myconid**: Mushroom creature with tentacles, source of fungus infection in cave, capable of mind-controlling other creatures
- **Infected Bugs**: Small creatures with fungus stalks growing from heads, controlled by myconid, easily defeated
- **Leshy**: Aelysh's familiar, infected with fungus, was being controlled by myconid, fled after myconid's defeat

### Quests/Tasks
- **Fungus Investigation**: Help Aelysh investigate and stop source of fungus infection affecting woodland creatures before it spreads, participants: Aurelia, Arnor, Bruldin, Aelysh, completed successfully with Bruldin's infection treated

### Items
- **Unidentified Leaf**: Quest reward from Aelysh, magical properties unknown
- **Unidentified Scabbard**: Quest reward from Aelysh  
- **Unidentified Dagger**: Quest reward from Aelysh
- **Degraded Weapons**: Party's steel weapons need repair after fighting rust oozes

## Unresolved Questions
- Properties of the three unidentified quest rewards
- Whether the fungus infection threat has been fully eliminated
- Connection between this fungus quest and Aelysh's elderberry procurement request from previous sessions

## Technical Notes
- This was a recap session due to lost recording from actual June 13 session
- Limited detail available compared to normal transcripts - players reconstructing events from memory
- Some name confusion: GM sometimes says "Alish" when referring to Aelysh
- Date initially confused but confirmed as Aestra-Orpheus 13th
