# The Fleshcrafter's Domain

## Prompt

```
Epic fantasy digital painting, terrifying necromancer revealed in ritual chamber with elevation changes and stone steps. The Fleshcrafter (large tall female creature with no visible eyes, horns covering her head like a crown of bone, wearing grotesque patchwork cloak of mottled pale leather segments in various colors and sizes) stands imperiously on raised platform, her eyeless face and horn-crowned head evoking comparison to Pan's Labyrinth's Pale Man. Around her shuffle pale, gaunt undead figures (shambling corpse-like beings with deathly pallor moving in disturbing, unnatural ways, creating obstacles wherever they shamble). A green-scaled lizardfolk monk (male Slaan with bright green scales, practical leather armor, bo staff), scarred dwarven slayer (male dwarf with white braided beard, bare torso with ritual scars, massive maul), Norn spellcaster (male human with long dark hair, blue Nordic clothing with golden symbols, bird skull pendant), and elderly human chef (wild white hair, weathered face, worn leather vest, wooden staff) stand at chamber entrance, weapons ready but facing impossible odds. Stone walls carved for giant creatures, oppressive atmosphere of spiritual wrongness pressing down like physical weight. Dim torchlight and unnatural purple-green glow from necromantic auras create sinister lighting. Art style: detailed, dark fantasy horror, painterly, ArtStation quality, inspired by Pan's Labyrinth and Lord of the Rings. Wide composition showing chamber's scale and the necromancer's commanding presence above her shambling undead servants.

## Context

This scene captures the first full encounter with the Fleshcrafter in her ritual chamber. The party enters to find her standing in all her grotesque glory, surrounded by the fleshless corpses of her victims - skinned bodies animated as walker and crawler troops that create difficult terrain. Her cloak of stitched skins and eyeless horned appearance create a nightmarish image of necromantic power and artistic cruelty. This is the moment before combat begins, when the full horror of what she's created becomes visible.
