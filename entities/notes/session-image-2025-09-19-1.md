# The Rat Swarm Attack

## Prompt

```
Epic fantasy digital painting, coordinated rat swarm assault in rustic mess hall with sunlight streaming through windows. Rodents of Unusual Size (dog-sized rats with matted filth-covered fur, yellow fangs long as child's fingers, heavy muscular bodies) burst through doors and crash through windows in organized waves. At center, a green-scaled lizardfolk monk (male Slaan with bright green scales, lighter coloration on snout and throat, wearing practical leather armor with straps and buckles, wielding bo staff with devastating precision) delivers crushing blows to nearest giant rat while blessed with divine light. Nearby, an elderly human chef (wild white hair like storm cloud, weathered face with deep wrinkles, leather vest over simple shirt, holding wooden staff) channels holy magic while defending. Female dhampir investigator (porcelain-pale skin, crimson eyes, sharp black bob with straight bangs, black leather jacket over corsets and straps, rapier drawn close combat) abandons bow for blade work with surgical precision. In background, bardish woman with lute takes cover while hob server (female goblinoid with domesticated features) fights back. Most unsettling: normal-sized rats perch on windowsills watching the assault with intelligent eyes, never attacking but clearly directing tactical operations through squeaked commands. Multiple giant rats execute flanking maneuvers and coordinated theft operations, dragging sacks of stolen food toward exits. Morning light illuminates chaos, broken windows, overturned tables, professional military operation disguised as vermin infestation. Art style: detailed, dynamic action composition, painterly, ArtStation quality with emphasis on the unsettling intelligence behind the swarm's coordination.
