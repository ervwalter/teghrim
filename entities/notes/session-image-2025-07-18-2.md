# Bloodlines Revealed

## Prompt

```
Epic fantasy digital painting, elegant Gothic dining scene in a vampire's island manor. A pale dhampir investigator (female with porcelain-pale skin, crimson eyes, sleek black bob haircut with bangs, wearing black leather jacket over elaborate gothic corset) sits across from a stunning vampire noble (female with lustrous black curls, aristocratic features, black and red corset dress with white puffy sleeves). Between them, a nervous mortal attendant (male aspiring vampire with knowing expression) reluctantly produces coins for a lost wager. Candlelight illuminates expensive Gothic furnishings and creates dramatic shadows, while the conversation carries weight of revealed heritage and family connections. The atmosphere suggests both danger and kinship. Art style: Gothic romance, painterly, rich shadows and warm candlelight. Medium shot emphasizing the triangular relationship and social dynamics.
```
