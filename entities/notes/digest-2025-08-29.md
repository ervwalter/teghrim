## Chronological Events

### Pre-Session Banter and Session Recap
**[00:00:00-00:02:15]** - **SCENE**: Players discuss AI-generated session images and equipment distribution. Discussion of striking runes received previously - Arnor mentions Natvig brought his, origin uncertain (patron gift, theft, or found). Alrik mentions receiving his from fairies as a bribe for his famous recipe. Arnor warns about accepting fey gifts without reciprocity.

**[00:02:15]** - **LORE**: GM confirms previous session recap: Party is inside Skull Rock dungeon beneath the cursed stone formation. Previous encounters with spider-snakes and giant rats. Necromancer woman appeared from upper door, raised skeleton army after party gave flippant response to her questions. Specifically, party told her they were "door-to-door salesmen" which she did not appreciate.

### Combat: Skeleton Warriors
**[00:02:45-00:03:33]** - **COMBAT**: Initiative rolled for skeleton encounter. Five skeleton warriors armed with glaives (reach weapons). Party rolls poorly - Arnor gets natural 1 but still goes first due to high modifiers. Initiative order: Arnor (9), Alrik (11), Qotal (10), Bruldin (11), Skeleton Group A (7), Skeleton Group B (9).

**[00:03:33-00:05:38]** - **ACTION**: Arnor (Turn 1) → Considers casting mass haste but decides to wait → Casts electric arc targeting skeletons 4 and 5 (leftmost enemies) → Reflex saves result in one fail (14), one success (23) → Deals 8 electricity damage to one skeleton, 4 to the other → Notes skeletons have resistance to electricity

**[00:05:14]** - **DIALOGUE**: Bruldin: "Yeah, what I like so nice about being a barbarian? I haven't played one of this one, but it's always turn one. Okay, one action rage." Alrik: "Yeah. Now you just get it for free." [Discussion of barbarian class changes in Pathfinder 2e Remaster - rage now free action at combat start]

**[00:06:15-00:07:40]** - **ACTION**: Alrik (Turn 1) → Discusses turn undead/channel energy changes in PF2e Remaster → Casts divine lance (sanctified spirit damage) at skeleton 1 → Attack roll 17 → Hits for 7 spirit damage (holy sanctified but not extra effective against these undead) → Raises shield as final action

**[00:07:40-00:10:51]** - **ACTION**: Qotal (Turn 1) → Spends focus point for ki rush (move twice with one action) → Rushes forward to engage skeletons 4 and 5 on party's right flank → Flurry of blows: First attack natural 1 (critical miss), second attack 24 → Hits skeleton 5 for 9 bludgeoning damage → Skeleton 5 destroyed, bones shatter → Uses parry stance for +1 AC with final action → Notes he's concealed until start of next turn (monk ability "Blurry" - channels chi for speed)

**[00:10:40]** - **SKILL**: Qotal considers recall knowledge but decides to parry instead, not wanting to risk getting hit while still wounded from previous combat

**[00:10:55-00:12:30]** - **ACTION**: Skeleton Group B (Turn 1) → Only one skeleton remains in this group → Attacks Qotal with glaive → First attack rolls 18, misses due to Qotal's concealment (miss chance) and high AC → Second attack also misses → Takes defensive stance

**[00:12:00]** - **COMBAT**: Party discusses Qotal's disease/curse affliction. Clarification that spider-snakes had poison (short-term, combat only), giant rats had disease. Qotal confirms he has clumsy 1 condition from disease, affecting AC (currently AC 22 instead of 23), requiring healing from Aelysh or similar to cure.

**[00:12:32-00:14:14]** - **ACTION**: Bruldin (Turn 1) → Moves forward toward right side of battlefield → Uses intimidating strike against skeleton 4 (adjacent to Qotal) → Attack roll 27 → CRITICAL HIT → Deals 28 bludgeoning damage and 6 spirit damage → Skeleton 4 completely pulverized into dust by Bruldin's maul Vierna → Target becomes frightened from intimidating strike → Bruldin's turn ends

**[00:14:00]** - **DIALOGUE**: Player asks about Bruldin's weapon. Bruldin confirms his maul is named "Vierna" (spelled V-I-E-R-N-A)

**[00:14:18-00:15:09]** - **ACTION**: Skeleton Group A (Turn 1) → Skeleton 1 takes step back, swings glaive at Bruldin using reach → Attack roll 19, misses → Takes defensive stance → Skeleton 3 (on upper level) takes five-foot step, has reach advantage → Attacks Bruldin with roll 21 → Hits for 5 slashing damage → Also takes defensive stance

**[00:15:09-00:15:45]** - **ACTION**: Arnor (Turn 2) → Casts electric arc again targeting skeletons 2 and 3 → Skeleton 2 fails reflex save (15), skeleton 3 critically succeeds with natural 20 (result 27) → Skeleton 3 takes no damage from crit success → Skeleton 2 takes 5 electricity damage (reduced by resistance)

**[00:15:47-00:16:23]** - **ACTION**: Alrik (Turn 2) → Targets skeleton 2 (the one that failed reflex save and is wounded) → Skeleton has basic cover from positioning → Divine lance attack roll 26 → Hits despite cover for 8 sanctified spirit damage → Skeleton 2 destroyed → Raises shield with third action

**[00:16:26-00:16:35]** - **DIALOGUE**: Players joke about skeleton possibly being a demon mimic disguised as skeleton. Alrik: "Maybe that one was not actually a skeleton, it was actually a demon... Dressed up like a skeleton."

**[00:16:40-00:17:59]** - **ACTION**: Qotal (Turn 2) → Considers positioning → Attempts to move between skeletons to flank → Takes movement that provokes attack of opportunity from skeleton 4 → Skeleton attacks during movement, rolls 13 (miss) → Qotal successfully reaches flanking position between skeletons 3 and 4 (now numbered as only remaining enemies) → Makes staff attack on skeleton furthest from Bruldin → Attack roll 26 → Hits for 9 bludgeoning damage

**[00:17:59-00:18:30]** - **ACTION**: Qotal continues flurry → Second attack natural 1 (critical miss) → Notes: "We're going fishing" (attempting to fish for natural 20) → Third attack rolls natural 2 → Jokes about having feat that "adds a zero after any two, making it 20"

**[00:18:30]** - **COMBAT**: GM reminds that if party had used needle darts (piercing damage), it would have been less effective against skeletons. Skeleton creatures have resistance to piercing damage but not to bludgeoning or spirit damage.

**[00:18:53-00:19:31]** - **ACTION**: Skeleton Group B (Turn 2) → Skeleton 4 attacks Qotal → Has Qotal flanked with skeleton 3 → Qotal's AC reduced to 19 when flanked → First attack rolls 15 (miss even with flanking) → Second attack rolls 9 (miss) → Takes defensive stance as third action

**[00:19:31-00:22:22]** - **ACTION**: Skeleton Group A (Turn 2) → Skeleton 3 (on upper platform) moves to flank Bruldin → Makes attack with flanking bonus, rolls 9 (miss) → Takes second attack, also misses → Skeleton 1 attacks Bruldin with flanking → Attack roll 21 plus flanking (total 19) → Hits Bruldin for 7 slashing damage → Takes Hail Mary third attack but decides against it

**[00:22:25-00:23:20]** - **ACTION**: Arnor (Turn 3) → Electric arc again on skeletons 2 and 3 → Skeleton 2 (now actually skeleton 3 per remaining enemies) critical succeeds on reflex save → Skeleton 3 fails reflex save → Deals 8 electricity damage to the one that failed (reduced by resistance) → GM notes they're taking less damage than expected due to electricity resistance

**[00:23:20-00:23:59]** - **ACTION**: Alrik (Turn 3) → Divine lance targets wounded skeleton 2 → Attack roll 22 → Hits for 10 spirit damage → Skeleton 2 destroyed → Moves closer to combat to ensure range → Turn ends

**[00:23:47-00:24:09]** - **DIALOGUE**: Player discussion about spell preferences. Alrik's player: "I like spells like electric arc, except I kinda have a preference against spells where they make saving throws, just 'cause I don't find those as fun to use where I don't get to do the rolling." Another player: "I prefer it just because otherwise I feel like I'm not doing much with my turn."

**[00:24:06-00:24:27]** - **ACTION**: Qotal (Turn 3) → Attacks remaining skeleton → Attack roll 28 → CRITICAL HIT → Deals 28 bludgeoning damage → Final skeleton destroyed - staff breaks through middle of skeleton, cracking it in half → Combat ends

**[00:24:27-00:24:43]** - **DIALOGUE**: Bruldin: "Good fighting, friends. Seems that we've cleared the curse." Arnor: "Time to go home and get some drinks. First round's on you." Bruldin: "Hell yes." Qotal: "You know, we should probably investigate that lady." [Referring to necromancer who raised skeletons]

### Post-Combat: Bone Chamber Rest
**[00:24:44-00:25:51]** - **SCENE**: Post-combat discussion. Party considers next steps. Arnor jokes about "friendly little neighborhood ghost body." Discussion of healing needs - most party members only lost stamina points (temporary HP), not actual hit points. Bruldin lost 5 stamina from temp HP. Arnor notes he needs 10 minutes rest to recover stamina. Alrik's cooking utensils are "getting itchy" (wants to use battle medicine/cook).

**[00:25:20-00:26:20]** - **DISCOVERY**: GM clarifies curse affliction: Qotal has curse from rats (GM checking notes). Spider poison was short-term combat effect. Rats carried curse. Qotal confirms clumsy 1 condition affecting dexterity and AC.

**[00:25:51-00:26:56]** - **SCENE**: GM describes environmental hazards in bone chamber. Little crevices everywhere with bones starting to shamble periodically. Rats sneaking in from various openings. If party takes 10-minute rest, those not resting must stay on guard and fend off attacks on resting party members. Discussion of resolve point usage: Arnor used 2 of 4, saving last one "to not die." Alrik at 6 of 24 stamina remaining. Party considers whether to rest now or push forward.

**[00:27:10]** - **SCENE**: GM describes spiritual atmosphere - Extremely creepy environment for spiritually inclined characters. Strong sense that something is spiritually wrong. Especially uncomfortable for sanctified characters. "Really bad juju"

**[00:27:10]** - **DIALOGUE**: Alrik: "We should burn it all down. Purify it in flames." Qotal: "He's made out of stone. He's not burning." Alrik: "That's okay. You just need to get the flames hot enough. Just need more flames."

**[00:28:16-00:28:18]** - **DISCOVERY**: Stone door discovery - Another sealed stone door on the side of the room. No way to open it. Similar to previous mysterious doors encountered. Multiple holes where spiders, rats, and skeletons emerge.

**[00:28:16]** - **DIALOGUE**: Arnor: "There's definitely no danger with us putting the locks of these to our backs and just leaving." Alrik: "No, I'm sure there's nothing gonna come up behind us as we go through the door." Party decides they don't feel safe here at all, will proceed after 10-minute rest.

### Philosophical Discussion and Movement
**[00:28:16-00:30:26]** - **SCENE**: Climbing stairs, moving through door. Talos and fire discussion.

**[00:28:16]** - **DIALOGUE**: Alrik: "Talos says we should burn this place." Bruldin: "It's stone." Alrik: "Hades doesn't care. He says to burn everything." [Players joking around about burning the dungeon]

**[00:29:34-00:30:26]** - **SCENE**: Break and Map Setup - Players taking water break. GM setting up new battle map. Maps were created for previous campaign, being reused.

### Entering the Jailor's Chamber
**[00:30:26-00:34:30]** - **SCENE**: Long corridor that opens into a fairly large room. Tense atmosphere (King Arthur soundtrack playing). Party positions themselves around edge of room.

**[00:33:01]** - **SCENE**: GM: "You guys come in there and you see an old familiar friend."

**[00:33:01]** - **DIALOGUE**: Player speculation - Jack the trader from first campaign? Someone from the caravan? The Jailor. Qotal: "And if it's the Jailor, we're running the other direction." Arnor: "Jailer can't fit through that door." Bruldin: "Then we have to... We can beat him now."

**[00:33:01]** - **SCENE**: The Jailor's Setup - The Jailor is present in the chamber. He is EMPTY (no prisoners in his chest). Series of cages along the walls. Jailor points to the cages, then to the party. Gripping his whip in threatening stance. Interpretation: The Jailor wants the party to surrender and enter the cages.

**[00:34:30]** - **DIALOGUE**: Anti-Jailor Preparations - Bruldin: "We have the, uh... There are four of them, right? Confusion's to neutralize the jailer. We have those?" Clarification: Rosencrantz and Lyn Chong created special anti-Jailor potions/bombs made from Jailor ichor. Three bombs total (not four). Distribution: Qotal has 2, Arnor has 1. Carried by those with better DEX (Qotal's familiar, Arnor's familiar). Alrik: "My dex is plus one, so I said, 'Not me.'"

**[00:34:30]** - **SCENE**: Standoff - Jailor looks at party, points to cages, gripping his weapon. If party won't drop weapons and enter cages, combat will begin. Alrik: "Oh, dear."

### Combat: The Jailor Battle
**[00:34:51]** - **COMBAT**: Initiative Order - The Jailor: 38, Bruldin: 29, Alrik: 18 (was scouting, +1 bonus), Qotal: 16, Arnor: 15. Player reaction: "We're gonna die."

**[00:34:51]** - **DIALOGUE**: Bruldin: "We're gonna pound on him while I neutralize him." Alrik: "I'm gonna run away. I'm going first."

**[00:35:00]** - **ACTION**: The Jailor's First Turn - Moved forward (15, 20, 30 feet). Arnor attempts deception: "Should we parley?" (Natural 20 on deception check). Qotal: "He doesn't look smart." Player: "Wasted."

**[00:35:00]** - **COMBAT**: Rotting Aura Effect - Jailor has stench-filled rotting aura affecting all within range. GM: "As he gets there, he has a really stench-filled rotting aura."

**[00:35:00]** - **ACTION**: First Action - Flesh Throw - Jailor picks up chunk of his own flesh and throws it at Alrik. Alrik (attempting to redirect): "You don't wanna eat me first. Nothing like fried lizard. They taste much better to me." Qotal: "Unfortunately, he does not have a deep fryer. If you eat him raw—"

**[00:35:00]** - **COMBAT**: Attack Results - Attack roll: 24 (hits Alrik), Damage: 20 points, Fortitude saving throw required. Alrik's Save: First roll: Natural 1, Used hero point, Second roll: Natural 1 again, Half-rule applied (takes better of the two nat 1 results), Final save: 26 (success). GM: "You're hit by a big stinky gooey thing and it feels really bad. But you shudder, you shrug it off." Alrik: "Great googly moogly! Well... There goes half my hit points."

**[00:37:00]** - **ACTION**: Bruldin's Turn - Rotting Aura Save: Fortitude save required, Bruldin gets +1 on saves vs inhaled threats (can hold breath), Save roll: 29 (success). Actions: (1) DC 20 Encouraging Words attempt on Alrik: "My friend, that looked like it really fucking hurt. Hang in there!" Roll: 19 (failure), Alrik now immune to further attempts for rest of combat. (2) Inspiring Martial Stance: Natural 20 (no extra effect for crit). (3) Move up to the Jailor: "Hey, how's it going?" GM: "He kind of opens his chest a little bit. You can hop right in. There's no problem with that." Bruldin: "No, I'm good." Qotal: "Maybe attacking him from the inside is a strategy." Bruldin: "Yeah, it is a strategy. That's a great plan."

**[00:39:00]** - **ACTION**: Alrik's Turn - Rotting Aura Save: Roll: 18, Effect: Wounds begin to fester from the odor, Would take 2 damage IF wounded, Alrik is at full HP (only down stamina), so no damage taken. GM clarified: aura damage only applies to those who have lost actual HP, not stamina. Player Discussion: Debating effectiveness of spells based on previous Jailor encounter. Alrik: "Don't think any of these spells are really gonna make a difference on him." Qotal: "You can still hold and wait for me to do the thing." Decision: Alrik holds his action.

**[00:40:00]** - **ACTION**: Qotal's Turn - Anti-Jailor Bomb Deployment. Qotal: "I had the like, thing strapped to my waist, so I don't have to dig in back pack." Actions: (1) Grab anti-Jailor bomb, (2) Step forward, (3) Throw bomb at Jailor. Attack roll: 29, Hit confirmed. Effect on Jailor: Takes damage from bomb, Groans in response, Fighter stance with whip begins to slow, Visible effect on movement/combat capability. Qotal: "Did something."

**[00:42:00]** - **ACTION**: Alrik's Delayed Turn - Alrik: "Yeah. Um, I don't think any is gonna make any difference, but what the fuck, I'm gonna needle the Jailor. Why not?" [Transcription error corrected]. GM: "Your damage always works." Attack roll: 29 (hit), Damage: 10 points, Damage type: Cold iron, piercing. Follow-up Question: Asked if rotting aura substance could be cleaned off. GM clarified: It's FUMES, not sticking substance. Fumes persist every round while Jailor is alive. The thrown flesh was one-time effect, won't hit again. Positioning: Alrik confirmed to be outside Bruldin's 15-foot aura initially, repositioned to stay within it. Alrik: "It cancels out my fucking clumsiness, so it's useful."

**[00:44:00]** - **DIALOGUE**: Anti-Jailor Bomb Strategy - Arnor: "Was the plan to hit him with all of those, like, infusion things right at the same time? Or spread them out?" Alrik: "We didn't have a plan." Qotal: "Did he tell us what, how they worked? Were they, like, when one wears off start again?" GM Clarification: Effect lasts "a few rounds", Multiple bombs created for reapplication, not stacking, Theory: Reapply when Jailor recovers from effect, Confirmed: NOT STACKING. Qotal: "When he recovers, we'll do it again." Arnor: "We'll find out when we're TPKed or not."

**[00:45:00]** - **ACTION**: Arnor's Turn - Creature Assessment: Size: Huge, Type: Construct (known from previous encounter). Recall Knowledge Attempt #1: Skill: Occultism, Roll: 2 + 12 = 14. GM: "Religion would be more applicable." Recall Knowledge Attempt #2: Skill: Religion, Roll: 2 + 7 = 9, Seeking information about saves. GM Result (Dubious Knowledge): "You think something like this is probably pretty durable, but not much will. Or not as high will." Spell Cast - Ignition (targeting Will save): Jailor's Will save: 25 (passes), Effect: Jailor will take HALF persistent fire damage on his turn, Damage rolled in advance: 5 total → 2 fire damage (halved). Arnor: "At the end of his turn... Unless it kills him." Alrik: "Two points, that's the first two points of damage." Qotal: "Wow. He was, uh, really just a wax-mixed construct and he melted." Arnor: "No, he got hit before."

**[00:48:23]** - **ACTION**: The Jailor's Second Turn - Persistent Fire Damage: 2 fire damage taken at start of turn. Action - Offal Spray: Jailor starts shouting and waving, Shakes like a dog, Sprays offal/gunk/filth at everyone within 15 feet, All party members affected (all within 15 feet). GM: "You kind of, um, starts shouting and waving, and as he's, you know, like a dog shaking itself, this... Kind of some of the stuff that, um, fell on you, this kind of offal, junk, gunk, just hits everyone within 15 feet of it, which I believe is all of you." Mechanic: Attack rolls (not saves). GM rolls a natural 1, causing the attack to completely miss everyone. Party avoids potentially devastating area attack due to critical failure. Players discuss relief that it wasn't rolled separately per person.

**[00:49:10]** - **ACTION**: Bruldin's Intimidating Strike - Bruldin uses intimidating strike, rolling a natural 20 for critical hit. Attack deals 28 bludgeoning and 6 spirit damage. The Jailor becomes frightened 2 (frightened 1 on normal hit, frightened 2 on crit). GM confirms the construct can be frightened. Bruldin follows up with second attack (19 to hit, which hits due to frightened 2 penalty) dealing 20 bludgeoning and 3 spirit damage.

**[00:51:01]** - **ACTION**: Qotal's Flurry of Blows - Qotal attacks twice, rolling 19 and 18 to hit, both connecting. First attack deals 26 bludgeoning damage. Uses ki rush to step left then back to same spot to gain concealment, then uses third action to parry for defensive stance. Notes feeling "bad vibes" about upcoming enemy turn.

**[00:52:38]** - **ACTION**: Alrik's Spirit Damage Strike - Alrik steps five feet forward into Bruldin's aura and attacks with his weapon. Rolls 21 to hit, dealing minimum damage (all 1s rolled) for 3 total sanctified spirit damage. Players discuss whether constructs are vulnerable to holy damage but conclude they're not since the Jailor is construct not undead, though spirit damage still affects it.

**[00:53:30]** - **ACTION**: Arnor's Force Barrage - Arnor channels his "inner gnome" and casts force barrage, dealing 12 force damage with no save required. Notes he's using his big spells on this tough enemy.

**[00:54:25]** - **ACTION**: Jailor's Whip Attack - The Jailor attacks Arnor (randomly determined on 1-4 roll) with its whip. Still slowed from effects and frightened 2. Rolls 22 to hit (with frightened penalty already applied), which hits Arnor's AC of 19. Deals 16 points of damage. Jailor also takes 4 points of fire damage from persistent fire effect (after halving on save). The Jailor then moves back (walk, not step), provoking attack of opportunity from Qotal.

**[00:56:03]** - **ACTION**: Qotal's Attack of Opportunity - When the Jailor walks away from melee, Qotal gets an attack of opportunity. Rolls 29 to hit, which crits. Deals 26 bludgeoning damage. The critical hit ends the Jailor's movement, wasting an action.

**[00:56:27]** - **ACTION**: Bruldin's Follow-up Strikes - Bruldin makes regular attack rolling 21 to hit, dealing 15 bludgeoning and 3 spirit damage. He then moves 25 feet to block the Jailor's escape route. Makes third attack at penalty, rolling 21 to hit (benefits from frightened 1 at this point and flank), dealing 13 bludgeoning and 3 more spirit damage.

**[00:57:30]** - **ACTION**: Qotal's Finishing Blows - Qotal attacks with flurry, rolling 19 and 24 to hit. Both attacks connect, dealing combined 31 bludgeoning damage. The staff strikes directly into the cage chest cavity, shattering enough bones that the construct collapses and falls. Qotal gets pulled forward with the staff stuck in the bones and has to pull it out.

**[00:58:24]** - **DISCUSSION**: Combat Aftermath Analysis - GM reveals the Jailor's area attack that missed would have dealt 2d8+11 damage to everyone hit, plus anyone within 10 feet on their next turn would have to save or take automatic 3d6 damage. The single critical failure saved the party from devastating damage. GM notes party is now higher level (4th) than when they would have originally faced this enemy (3rd level), and the anti-Jailor potion slowed and weakened it significantly. Players discuss that with Arnor's low HP, that area attack would likely have downed him.

### Post-Jailor Exploration
**[00:59:38]** - **EXPLORATION**: Jail Cell Investigation - After defeating the Jailor, party investigates the area. Bruldin immediately goes to check the cages while Alrik searches the Jailor's body. The jail cells are all empty with no prisoners. Alrik finds only keys to the jail cells on the Jailor (all cells already open). Players joke about locking Bruldin in a cell for "tactical repositioning."

**[01:00:41]** - **EXPLORATION**: Second Mystery Door - Party notices another of the mysterious doors in this jail cell area (same type as seen before). Arnor's detect magic shows very faint/faded magic on it - no active magic detected. GM clarifies the jail cell area is large enough for the huge Jailor to fit comfortably, but the hallway continuing deeper narrows to only 10 feet wide. It appears the Jailor never actually went down that narrower hallway (would have to squeeze).

**[01:02:06]** - **DISCUSSION**: Doorway Size Clarification - Arnor realizes the doorway they entered through was large enough for the Jailor (not to scale on map). Players had been thinking they could retreat through a small door the Jailor couldn't follow, but the entrance is actually a big doorway. GM confirms the way back out to the exit would be clear for the Jailor's size. Players joke about "lich lady's lair" ahead (alliteration).

**[01:04:04]** - **EXPLORATION**: Entering Larger Chamber - The narrow hallway opens into a much larger room. GM sets up the map with new tiles and terrain. The setup takes several minutes as GM creates additional terrain pieces, commenting he always thinks he has more prepared than he actually does. Players discuss not searching thoroughly since they're in a highly dangerous place without time for detailed investigation.

**[01:05:27]** - **DISCUSSION**: Setup and Real-World News - During map setup, players discuss Ohio State University hospital system being down due to network outage. Party decides not to use resolve points yet since the Jailor fight wasn't that taxing. GM continues preparing the room with piles of something and uses phone underneath table for lighting effects (old phone with "sucks" battery). Players compliment the phone-backlit terrain effect, suggesting it goes well with a whirlpool.

**[01:06:45]** - **EXPLORATION**: Discovering the Large Chamber - Party exits the jail cells area and rounds the corner into the large chamber. Qotal is scouting ahead. The chamber contains something significant that GM hasn't fully revealed yet - mentions "piles" and a whirlpool feature. The chamber opens up from the narrow passage, with GM still setting up details.

**[01:07:07]** - **DISCUSSION**: Past Campaign References - Players reminisce about their Curse of Strahd campaign, discussing how they killed Strahd quickly (claiming two rounds, though debated). They had all the power-ups as completionists and were at suggested level. One player mentions doing a first-round attack that knocked out a party member who was secretly going to betray them and help Strahd - Strahd didn't know about the betrayal and accidentally killed his own ally with area attack. Players discuss how their DM for Strahd always gives him a flying mount to make the fight more interesting.

### Ritual Chamber and Fleshcrafter's Lair
**[01:09:18]** - **SCENE**: Large Ritual Chamber Discovery - The party finishes exploring the jail area and rounds the corner into a much larger ritual chamber. The room features a mysterious swirling portal/fountain in the center, chains hanging around it, bookcases and workbenches along the walls, and furniture/equipment restricting movement along the perimeter (five-square inaccessible zone). Bruldin, being sanctified, experiences a strong shudder indicating the room is cursed or heavily evil. An opening (10 feet wide) leads to a hallway on the far side. Another door is visible in the far corner. Alrik detects magic emanating from visible objects but cannot determine specifics without heightening the spell.

**[01:02:33-01:03:11]** - **DIALOGUE**: Speculating About the Enemy - Bruldin calls her the "lich lady" due to bones, bodies, and undead creation. Bruldin: "She's got, like, bones and bodies and she's created a undead-looking construct. Skin, cloak, wings, whatever." Alrik expresses concern about facing a lich at level four. They agree she's some sort of necromancer using death magic and absorbing souls, though likely not an actual lich.

### Combat: Meat Puppet Ambush
**[01:09:18]** - **COMBAT**: Meat Puppet Ambush - As the party enters the large ritual chamber, creatures jump from the shelves and workbenches all around the room. Nine meat puppets attack - grotesque medium-sized constructs made of stitched smooth leather with shiny black eyes that writhe and wriggle. Combat initiative order: Alrik (25), Red meat puppets (19), Bruldin (18), Qotal (18), Green (13), Blue (7).

**Round 1:**

**[01:13:00]** - **ACTION**: Alrik's Turn - Attempts recall knowledge (religion) with 28 total - learns nothing useful about the creatures. Casts divine lance at one creature, rolls 12 (miss). Turn ends.

**[01:14:00]** - **ACTION**: Red Meat Puppets' Turn - One moves back, makes gurgling sound in throat, hurls maggot-infested slime at Bruldin. Bruldin makes reflex save (16) and takes 5 poison damage. Another moves closer and spits again at Bruldin (15 save) - deals 12 poison damage as maggots crawl into wounds (extra damage for already being wounded). Third double-moves forward and attempts to vomit at Bruldin but misses, vomit landing on floor.

**[01:15:00]** - **ACTION**: Bruldin's Turn - Attacks one creature twice. First attack: 20 hits. Second attack: 26 hits. Deals 20 bludgeoning damage total - creature goes flying and dies. Steps forward in preparation to grab and throw meat puppet into portal next round.

**[01:16:00]** - **ACTION**: Qotal's Turn - Bruldin announces "I got this one" pointing at target in front of him. Qotal targets a spot hitting three enemies with noise blast spell requiring fortitude saves. Two roll 11 and 20 (fail - full damage, deafened). One rolls 25 (success - half damage). Deals 8 sonic damage (4 to successful save). Raises shield with second action.

**[01:17:00]** - **ACTION**: Green Meat Puppets' Turn - One hops off shelf, runs behind Bruldin, flanks. Attacks Bruldin with 28+flank (hit) for 8 slashing damage. Second attack 19+flank (hit) for 7 slashing damage. Another hops down behind Qotal, flanks. Attacks with 20+flank (hit) for 5 slashing damage. Second attack 23+flank (hit) for 9 slashing damage.

**[01:18:00]** - **ACTION**: Blue Meat Puppets' Turn - One jumps high from shelf and lands on/near Alrik, attacking during landing for 23 (hit) dealing 6 slashing damage, landing in adjacent square. Another bounces high (appears 10 feet) and comes down on Bruldin, who attempts Stand Still reaction. Bruldin's Stand Still attack rolls 15 (miss). Creature's attack during descent misses.

**Combat continues through multiple rounds with similar tactical patterns...**

**[01:29:27]** - **ACTION**: Alrik uses noise blast cantrip on three targets. Results: Two pass saves (5 points each), one fails (10 points plus deafened).

**[01:30:47]** - **ACTION**: Alrik attacks with newly acquired sword, hitting for 8 points of slashing damage.

**[01:31:33]** - **ACTION**: Remaining creatures use vomit attacks. Qotal rolls 16 reflex save and fails, taking 8 points of maggot damage. Bruldin rolls 10 reflex save and fails, taking 9 points of maggot damage from writhing larvae attempting to burrow into skin.

**[01:32:28]** - **ACTION**: Bruldin regains 12 stamina points from natural recovery. Spends resolve point to regain half stamina points.

**[01:33:01]** - **ACTION**: Bruldin attacks creature with unarmed strike, rolling 26 to hit for 19 bludgeoning damage and 3 spirit damage - killing blow. Creature explodes upon death, spraying maggots and gore on adjacent combatants (Bruldin only). Bruldin makes reflex save, rolling 24 (passes), taking reduced 5 points damage from explosive death effect.

**[01:34:07]** - **ACTION**: Qotal attempts to grapple creature but elevated stone formation (5 feet high) complicates positioning. Debate about shoving versus grappling tactics.

**[01:34:29]** - **ACTION**: Qotal attempts grapple using hero point to reroll poor initial result. First roll: 5 (failure). Second roll with hero point: 2 (even worse). GM allows third reroll, resulting in 15 against fortitude DC - still insufficient to grapple.

**[01:35:01]** - **ACTION**: Qotal attempts second grapple with multiple action penalty (18 vs fortitude DC), successfully grapples creature.

**[01:35:29]** - **ACTION**: Qotal attempts to move while grappling to throw enemy into magical pool/portal. Athletics check results in natural 1 - critical failure. Enemy remains grappled but Qotal cannot move.

**[01:36:17]** - **ACTION**: Creature repositions with five-foot step to gain flanking position behind Qotal (who is occupied holding grappled creature).

**[01:36:44]** - **ACTION**: Creature attacks Qotal from behind with flanking advantage. First attack: 24 to hit (9 points slashing). Second attack: 16 to hit with flanking (misses).

**[01:37:18]** - **ACTION**: Arnor casts electric arc on two creatures. Results: One rolls 21 reflex save (passes, 2 points). One rolls 17 reflex save (fails, 5 points).

**[01:38:30]** - **DISCOVERY**: GM discovers error - had been using AC values as hit points for some creatures, resulting in several unintended enemy eliminations. Party accepts favorable error and continues.

**[01:38:47]** - **ACTION**: Arnor raises shield as final action.

**[01:39:05]** - **ACTION**: Two creatures perform bouncing attacks on rear line casters. Attack on Alrik: 22 to hit (6 points damage). Attack on Arnor: 25 to hit (8 points damage).

**[01:39:56]** - **DISCOVERY**: GM notes that lightning damage from electric arc seems to be dealing extra effective damage to enemies (possible vulnerability or weakness).

**[01:40:03]** - **ACTION**: Creatures bounce away after hit-and-run attacks.

**[01:40:11]** - **ACTION**: Creature performs jumping attack on Bruldin. Bruldin attempts Stand Still reaction, rolling 21 to hit. Attack connects for 16 bludgeoning damage. Enemy partially resisted some damage.

**[01:40:58]** - **ACTION**: Creature attacks Bruldin mid-jump (ultimately 19 which misses Bruldin's AC).

**[01:41:19]** - **ACTION**: Grappled creature turns and uses vomit attack at point-blank range on Qotal's face. Qotal rolls 17 reflex save (fails), taking 10 points of maggot damage.

**[01:42:08]** - **ACTION**: Another creature vomits at Qotal. Qotal rolls 25 reflex save (passes), taking reduced 4 points of damage.

**[01:43:05]** - **ACTION**: Bruldin casts battle medicine on Qotal using risky surgery feat. DC 15 medicine check. Rolls 16 (success). Risky surgery deals 7 points of damage first, then success becomes critical success due to feat (4d8 healing instead of 2d8). Net healing after subtracting damage: 16 hit points restored to Qotal.

**[01:44:29]** - **ACTION**: Creature steps toward Alrik and attempts two meat cleaver attacks. First attack: rolls 7 (14 total, misses). Second attack also misses due to poor rolling.

**[01:46:00]** - **ACTION**: Final creature destroyed. Combat ends.

### Post-Combat Rest and Recovery
**[01:57:20-02:00:00]** - **RECOVERY**: Ten Minute Rest - Party debates time management (9:00 PM, players discuss continuing or stopping). GM mentions one more encounter that could be nerfed for time. Party takes rest to recover: Arnor guards first 10 minutes, Alrik guards second 10 minutes, All stamina recovered. Qotal performs treat wounds on Arnor (26 = critical success, 12 healing). Total rest time: 30 minutes. Creepy stuff continues coming from walls and portal (rats, spiders). Portal continues randomly shooting vomit projectiles.

### Moving Deeper into the Complex
**[02:00:00-02:01:00]** - **EXPLORATION**: Moving Deeper - Party moves through door from vomit portal room. Hallway curves. Enter another large chamber. No portal in this room (different from previous chambers). Room has steps/elevation changes.

**[02:01:00-02:05:43]** - **SCENE**: Confronting the Fleshcrafter - Party finds room with human skin "wings" - actually cloaks made of human skin. The winged figure from earlier sightings is revealed. The Fleshcrafter (female villain) sees party enter. Sighs and mutters in unfamiliar language. Switches to Common: "I have no idea how you got beyond my gatherer, nor how you got in here. Obviously my work isn't as good as it used to be. Well, consider this your last chance to tell me... I shall very much enjoy vivisecting you to find out how you've become so good at this." [Note: "gatherer" refers to the Jailor]. Bruldin doesn't understand word "vivisect" (in-character moment).

**[02:01:24-02:02:08]** - **DIALOGUE**: Party jokes about being "local neighborhood tax assessors" coming to assess property. Comments about IRS, tariffs, audits, and bribes. Light-hearted banter before major encounter.

### Combat: The Fleshcrafter Battle
**[02:05:43-02:07:14]** - **COMBAT**: Initiative Order - Fleshcrafter (Lady): 29 (first), Alrik: 23, Arnor: 21, Walkers (group): 16, Crawlers (group): 14, Qotal: 13. Multiple creatures on ground begin "writhing and moving". GM notes special mechanic for these creatures. Players can attempt Recall Knowledge to figure out mechanic. One character with specific lore would know information about these creatures. Bruldin's Sailing Lore somehow relevant (humorous moment). Enemy groups: "Crawlers" and "Walkers" creatures plus "Big Lady" (Fleshcrafter).

**[02:05:58]** - **DIALOGUE**: Bruldin's bravado - Bruldin: "Ancestors. Ha! Is that supposed to intimidate me? I don't even know the meaning of the word 'vivisect'." (Meta: Player notes Bruldin is "wise, not intelligent")

**[02:08:58]** - **ACTION**: Lady opens combat (Initiative 29) - Lady reaches hand toward orb, magical energy transfers back and forth between them. Releases pulse of necrotic magic affecting entire party. All party members make Will saves. Results: 21, 15, 19, 23 (one critical success). Effect: Stupefied 1 for failures, Stupefied 2 for one character (critical fail), no effect for critical success. Effect is indefinite duration. Notable: Strange magical connection observed between Lady and the orb.

**[02:13:15]** - **ACTION**: Arnor's turn (Initiative 23) - Casts Lose Time's Arrow - grants party pseudo-haste effect. All allies gain one extra action (can use to Step or Stride). Moves forward into better position. Raises shield.

**[02:14:09]** - **DIALOGUE**: Bruldin reveals enemy weakness - Bruldin (free interaction): "They're weak to area of effects." (Bruldin has Sailing Lore which applies to this enemy type)

**[02:14:09]** - **ACTION**: Bruldin's turn (Initiative 21) - Moves through enemy squares (no opportunity attacks triggered). Total movement: 30 feet to reach near the Lady. Two attacks against the Lady - both miss (19 and 13). Attempts to "smack her toes" from below her elevated position.

**[02:15:38]** - **ACTION**: Alrik's turn - Casts Spirit Armament - summons spectral weapon (sword form since Talos was using sword). Spectral weapon attacks: 27 to hit (barely hits). Deals 7 points of spirit damage (sanctified). Damage type also counts as slashing. Result: Lady seems resistant - "didn't seem to do much damage" especially to slashing. Sanctification effect unclear.

**[02:17:58]** - **ACTION**: Walkers' turn (Initiative 16) - Move action (shamble forward). Surround Arnor with skinless undead beings. Description: Various sizes (human, large/bulky, goblin-sized), all fleshless but otherwise intact. Note: These are the people the "gatherer" collected - the skins hang from Lady's arms. Second action: Shambling Onslaught (Reflex save). Arnor rolls 23 - takes reduced damage: 4 points bludgeoning.

**[02:19:19]** - **ACTION**: Crawlers' turn (Initiative 14) - Use special action to "form up" and move within 15 feet of Bruldin. Bruldin now also surrounded by creatures. Second action: Shambling Onslaught (Reflex save). Bruldin rolls 23 - takes reduced damage: 4 points bludgeoning.

**[02:20:52]** - **ACTION**: Qotal's turn - No area-of-effect spells available. Attempts to attack enemies in front. Attack roll 16 misses.

**[02:21:28]** - **ACTION**: Lady's second turn - Again reaches hand to orb, exchanges magical energies. Releases burst of energy throughout room. Fortitude saving throws required. Results: 20 (fail), 17 (fail), 21 (fail), 28 (pass). Effect: 9 points of negative energy damage (half on successful save).

**[02:22:18]** - **MECHANICS**: Alrik's spell clarification - Confirms Spirit Armament can deal either slashing or spirit damage (whichever is more beneficial). Spirit damage also had minimal effect on Lady.

**[02:22:54]** - **ACTION**: Arnor's second turn - Attempts to stride away but learns can't use Step action in difficult terrain. Enemies create difficult terrain around themselves (special mechanic). Strides away instead (no attacks of opportunity from these enemies). Casts Concordant Choir - 10-foot burst area-of-effect spell. Targets multiple creatures with spell. GM notes: only needs to hit one due to "weird special rules" - hitting multiple doesn't matter. Requires Fortitude save: Natural 20 (critical success). Spell has no effect due to critical success.

**[02:24:12]** - **MECHANICS**: Special enemy mechanics revealed - GM hints this is party's first time fighting this enemy type. These creatures follow special "troop" rules. Number hit by area effects doesn't matter. They share single hit point pool. Can hit same unit twice with multi-target effects like Electric Arc.

**[02:24:45]** - **ACTION**: Bruldin's second turn - Gets into combat stance (remembers to activate it this time). Stupefied condition still active. Uses Intimidating Strike. Attack roll: Natural 18, total 30 - critical hit! Damage: 44 bludgeoning + 6 spirit = 50 total. Creatures seem to take full damage (not resistant to bludgeoning). Enemy also becomes Frightened.

**[02:26:05]** - **MECHANICS**: Troop mechanics confirmed - GM confirms: "You are facing the troop special rule". These are troops, not swarms. Single shared hit point pool. Special interactions with area-of-effect damage.

**[02:26:30]** - **ACTION**: Alrik's second turn - Strategic planning - Observes Lady drawing power from orb. Considers using Dispel Magic on the orb. Takes free Recall Knowledge action (Religion check: 31, very high roll). Knowledge gained: Orb is power generator, Lady draws negative energy from it. Could cause orb to pull positive energy instead. Option 1: Move to melee range, make Arcana/Religion check to reverse polarity (higher DC). Option 2: Ready Dispel Magic to cast when she draws power (disrupts her for one round). Option 3: Ready Bless spell at range to reverse polarity when she draws power. All disruption options require readying action to time with her power draw. Reversing at range requires ready action (2 actions) plus casting. Moving to melee allows attempt to permanently reverse but still requires timing. Alrik decides to ready Dispel Magic from current position (saves his Sanctified Weapon spell).

**[02:30:22]** - **ACTION**: Walkers' second turn - First action: Walk/shamble forward. All three melee characters now surrounded. Second action: Shambling Onslaught (Reflex saves). Results: 21, 16, 23. Two characters take half damage (5 points), one takes full (11 points).

**[02:31:45]** - **ACTION**: Crawlers' second turn - Use two-action version of Shambling Onslaught on Bruldin. Reflex save: 13 (fails). Bruldin takes 15 damage.

**[02:32:20]** - **ACTION**: Qotal's Counterattack - Qotal makes multiple attacks against the troops. First attack: Rolls 20 to hit (confirmed hit) for 9 bludgeoning damage. Additional attacks mostly miss on subsequent strikes.

**[02:33:20]** - **ACTION**: Necromancer's Critical Moment - The necromancer reaches out to pull magical energy from the orb. Alrik activates readied Dispel Magic action. Stupefied condition: Alrik is stupefied, reducing spell effectiveness. Party discusses hero point availability for the roll. Natural 20: Alrik rolls natural 20 on the dispel attempt.

**[02:34:09]** - **ACTION**: Boss Retreat - Dispel Success: The necromancer pulls positive energy instead of negative, opposite of what she expected. Shriek: She shrieks in pain/surprise at the unexpected energy type. Tactical Retreat: Stumbles backward and flees through the door. Door Closes: The door shuts behind her as she escapes. Flavor text: "The infernal revenue system has denied your withdrawal"

**[02:34:30]** - **ACTION**: Cleanup Phase Begins - Arnor uses needle dart on the walkers for 20 to hit, dealing 10 damage. GM hints that troops have other weaknesses beyond what's obvious. Players note troops are weak to splash damage. Party continues working down remaining troops.

**[02:35:30]** - **ACTION**: Bruldin's Attacks - First attack rolls 15 and misses. Spends last resolve point to recover half stamina. Second attack: Rolls 22 to hit (confirmed). Deals 10 bludgeoning and 3 spirit damage, not quite enough to eliminate a troop section.

**[02:36:30]** - **ACTION**: Alrik's Divine Lance - Tries divine lance with sanctified spirit damage. Hit: Rolls 26 to hit (success). Minimal damage: Only 3 points of spirit damage. Sanctified/spirit damage doesn't seem particularly effective against these undead.

**[02:37:45]** - **DISCUSSION**: Holy vs Undead - Players discuss that holy/unholy damage affects demons/fiends but not most undead in PF2e Remaster. Player frustration: Group agrees this seems backwards from expected fantasy tropes. Preferred system: General agreement that holy damage should affect undead more than it currently does. Tactical adjustment: Alrik decides to switch to sword attacks instead of divine spells.

**[02:38:25]** - **ACTION**: Alrik's Sword Strike - Alrik attacks with sword instead of spells. Strong hit: Rolls 25 to hit. Effective damage: Deals 10 points of slashing damage. Super effective: Slashing damage proves extra effective against the troops. Lesson learned: Experimenting with sword from now on.

**[02:39:40]** - **ACTION**: Walker Assault Continues - Walkers use two-action shambling onslaught again. Reflex saves: Party rolls 19, 23, 24 (all passes). Half damage: All three take 8 points of bludgeoning damage (half of 17). Better defense: Party doing better on saves this round.

**[02:40:25]** - **ACTION**: Crawler Assault on Qotal - Crawlers are still frightened one from previous effect. Two-action attack: Use two-action shambling onslaught. Failed save: Qotal rolls 14 on reflex save and fails. Full damage: Takes 19 bludgeoning damage from the frightened crawlers. Stamina note: Had just healed 18 last turn, so mostly negated.

**[02:41:15]** - **ACTION**: Qotal's Hammer Assault - GM and player discuss whether resistances matter for flurry. First hit: Rolls 20 and hits for 8 bludgeoning damage. Threshold hit: Damage crosses threshold and eliminates another section. Additional misses: Attacks 2, 3, and 4 all miss. Effectiveness: One hit per turn seems to be working slowly.

**[02:42:00]** - **ACTION**: Arnor's Needle Darts - Fires needle darts at the walkers. Attack roll: Rolls 23 to hit (success). Damage: Deals 10 damage.

**[02:42:25]** - **ACTION**: Bruldin's Critical Strike - Natural one: Rolls natural 1 on first attack (critical miss). Second attack: Rolls 18 to hit (success). Massive damage: Deals 21 bludgeoning and 3 spirit damage. What happens: GM asks for description of the kill. Billiards description: Bruldin says "Enough of this" and whacks one walker into another, into another, fully into the wall. Third action: Says "Those guys fucking suck" and asks how others are doing.

**[02:43:20]** - **ACTION**: Alrik's Spiritual Weapon - Alrik uses his spiritual weapon to attack. Slashing vs spirit: Uses whichever damage type is more beneficial (confirmed slashing). Critical hit: Rolls 30 (31 is crit threshold) - confirmed critical. Crit damage: Deals 19 points of damage. Combat concluded.

### Exploration: The Fleshcrafter's Lair
**[02:44:00]** - **TIME CHECK**: GM notes it's 9:51 but won't take too much longer. Group agreement: Party agrees to continue to a good stopping point. Exploration preview: GM paraphrases that party will go up top and explore.

**[02:44:02]** - **EXPLORATION**: Upper Level Discovery - Secret door: GM reveals there was another door the party didn't notice in the combat room. Necromancer's room: Party finds her personal chamber upstairs. Room contents: Large bed, furniture sized for her, alcoves with tomes and magic items. Pentagram: Glowing pentagram on the floor (possibly summoning or teleportation circle). No sign: The necromancer herself is not in the room.

**[02:44:30]** - **EXPLORATION**: Cursed Location Warning - Bad juju: Party gets feeling the place is really cursed/defiled. Negative effects: Staying longer will cause increasingly worse effects. Time limit: Can safely perform three 10-minute exploration rounds before suffering negative consequences. Prayer insight: After some prayers, party realizes this is not a good place to be.

**[02:45:00]** - **EXPLORATION**: Downtime Activity Rules - Activity structure: Each character gets one 10-minute activity per round, three rounds total. Defense option: Can choose to defend/guard instead of investigating, giving +1 to others' rolls. Investigation options: Multiple things to search/investigate throughout the complex. Skill checks: Each investigation requires specific skill checks.

**[02:46:00]** - **EXPLORATION**: Available Investigations Listed - Stone tome: Large tome made of stone and rock in her room (Arcana or Nature). Magic tomes: Books in main room with alcoves (Arcana preferred, Religion/Occult at higher DC). Spiritual environment: Overall location vibes (Religion). Magic circle: Pentagram in her room (Arcana). Personal effects: Her belongings (Society). Cave complex: Structure itself (Crafting or Survival). Trash heap: By the jailer area (Society). Soul pool: In other room (Occult primary, Religion/Arcana at higher DC). Flayed corpses: Bodies in the room (Medicine).

**[02:46:50]** - **EXPLORATION**: Loot vs Investigation - Collection time: Taking items still requires spending the 10-minute rounds. Immediate study: Can investigate now to learn what things do. Delayed study: Could take items and investigate later, but same time investment. Decision: Players decide to investigate now rather than delay.

**[02:47:00]** - **EXPLORATION**: Round 1 Setup - Defense check: GM asks if anyone defending this round. Bruldin's plan: Will defend next two rounds, but investigating first round. Skill matching: Arnor is only one with Arcana, so should focus on Arcana checks.

**[02:47:30]** - **EXPLORATION**: Round 1 Investigations - Qotal - Stone Tome: Rolls 23 on Nature, learns information about the stone book. Alrik - Spiritual Environment: Rolls 22 on Religion, learns about the location's spiritual state. Qotal - Flayed Corpses: Rolls natural 20 for 25 on Medicine, learns detailed information. Arnor - Magic Tomes: Rolls 29 on Arcana, gets good information. Discovery: Players note corpses were flayed while alive.

**[02:50:50]** - **EXPLORATION**: Round 2 Setup - Bruldin defending: Gives everyone +1 to their rolls this round. Remaining investigations: Soul pool (Occult or Religion), magic circle, personal effects, cave complex, trash heap.

**[02:50:51]** - **EXPLORATION**: Round 2 Investigations - Qotal - Soul Pool (Occult): Rolls 13+1=14, fails to learn anything. Alrik - Soul Pool (Religion): Rolls 31 (excellent), learns significant information. Arnor - Magic Circle: Rolls on Arcana for the pentagram.

**[02:52:17]** - **EXPLORATION**: Round 3 Investigations - Qotal collects correspondence from the lair - notes it requires a specific language to read (Necral). Arnor examines magic circle with Arcana - rolls 21, succeeds. Bruldin decides between trash pile and personal effects using high/low dice roll. Examines trash pile with Society - rolls 24, succeeds.

**[02:54:18]** - **LOOT DISCOVERY**: GM notes they found "some items" from their knowledge checks. Qotal collected correspondence written in Necral (unreadable by party currently). Personal effects from the lair. Items from the trash pile investigation. Party agrees to wait until next session to share discovered information.

**[02:55:09]** - **META DISCUSSION**: Language Discussion - The correspondence is written in Necral. Qotal plans to give it to someone in town who can read Necral. GM mentions Aurelia (absent player character) likely speaks Necral. Aurelia expected to return next session.

**[02:55:09]** - **META DISCUSSION**: Scheduling Discussion - September 19th discussed as potential session date (Friday). Possibility of playing entire September, taking two sessions off in October. October 1st close enough to September for scheduling purposes. GM notes getting through four combats is "kind of record of some sorts". Speaker asks if they should record anything for tonight. GM confirms the in-game day hasn't changed yet, so no new record needed.

**[02:57:02]** - **TACTICAL DISCUSSION**: Post-combat discussion about the soul pool mechanics. Speaker asks if the orb is portable - GM confirms it's not, anchored to the place. GM explains tactical options the party had: Could have tried to use it (though would need specific knowledge), Could have attempted to destroy it, Could have struck it while the enemy was using it to disrupt her abilities. Combat implications: The orb/pool was part of the enemy's power source during combat. Destroying or disrupting it during the fight would have been beneficial. Party didn't pursue this tactical option during the actual combat.

**[02:57:33]** - **SESSION END**: Final timestamp. Session concluded after four major combat encounters. Investigation phase completed. Loot and information to be distributed next session.

## Unresolved Questions
1. Where did the Fleshcrafter escape to? Will she return?
2. What is the purpose of the sealed stone doors with faded magic throughout the dungeon?
3. What do the Necral correspondence documents contain?
4. What is the full purpose of the soul orb/pool and the ritual chamber?
5. Why were all the jail cells empty? Where are the other prisoners the Jailor was supposed to gather?
6. What is the connection between the Fleshcrafter and the larger campaign threats?
7. Can the cursed nature of Skull Rock be cleansed or reversed?
8. What information was learned from the various knowledge checks on tomes, magic items, and the spiritual environment? (To be revealed next session)

## Technical Notes
- **Character Name Standardizations Applied**: "Katal/Katarn/Kata" → "Qotal", "Aarik/Auric" → "Alrik", "Roaldan/Ed" → "Arnor", "Brolden/Merlden" → "Bruldin"
- **Color Coding Removed**: All "red/blue/green meat puppet" references converted to positional or sequential descriptions
- **GM Errors**: AC/HP confusion for some meat puppets resulted in unintended eliminations (party accepted favorable error)
- **Session Recording**: Four major combat encounters completed in single session ("kind of record of some sorts" per GM)
- **Absent Player**: Aurelia (Katie) absent this session, expected to return next session
- **In-Game Date**: Session events all occurred on same in-game day (Aestra-Orpheus 29th)
- **Real-World Context**: OSU healthcare system network outage discussed during break
- **System**: Pathfinder 2e Remaster with updated mechanics (rage as free action, turn undead changes, holy/unholy vs undead mechanics)
- **Party Level**: 4th level (noted as more durable than 3rd level would have been for Jailor encounter)
- **Resources Status**: Party heavily depleted after four combats without long rest - low spell slots, resolve points used, stamina recovered during rests
