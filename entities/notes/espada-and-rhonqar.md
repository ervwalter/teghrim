# Espada and Rhonqar

Espada (also called Rhonqar) are supernatural entities highly related to elemental forces but not true elementals. They associate with ley line nexuses and appear connected to the Breath of the Nexus phenomenon, departing from their nexus locations according to natural cycles. The only known Espada in the [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing] region is Genovian, who once lived near the positive ley line nexus in the elevated waterfall plateau.

## Nature of Espada

**Elemental Connection**: Highly related to elements but distinct from true elementals. Genovian, for example, is associated with mist and can create misty emanations.

**Ley Line Association**: Espada are connected to ley line nexuses—points where magical energy concentrates. The waterfall region near [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing] contains a positive nexus, while a negative nexus exists far south across the mountain range in [entity:7763172|Astoria].

**Emanations**: Espada can create manifestations of themselves—semi-autonomous entities that share characteristics with their creator. Genovian's emanations take the form of one-eyed bird-like creatures that can observe, transform into mist, and act independently (though sometimes hostilely).

**Cyclical Presence**: Espada are expected to depart from their nexus locations according to natural cycles tied to the Breath of the Nexus. Genovian should have departed before the last Breath, yet her emanations persist.

## Terminology

**Espada**: The primary term used in the region, though the [entity:7764101|Willow Dryad] notes it's a borrowed name.

**Rhonqar**: An older or more formal term for the same entities. Qotal recognizes this name, suggesting it may be used in his homeland of [entity:7763174|Primordia] or in ancient scholarly texts.

## Known Espada

**Genovian**: Mist-associated Espada of the positive nexus near the waterfall plateau. Described as "a fairly kind person" who taught songs to forest creatures. Her current location is unknown, but her emanations continue appearing in the region.

## Connection to Breath of the Nexus

Espada appear tied to the cyclical phenomenon known as the Breath of the Nexus—periodic releases of concentrated natural energy from ley line nexuses. The relationship between Espada and these energy pulses remains unclear, but Espada are expected to depart their nexus locations according to this cycle.
