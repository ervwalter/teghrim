# The Brine Drake's Devastating Attack

## Prompt

```
Epic fantasy digital painting, massive aquatic dragon-like creature walking on river surface without breaking through, its serpentine body covered in aquatic scales, unleashing devastating breath weapon of scalding water and caustic spray toward four adventurers on riverbank. A green-scaled lizardfolk monk (male Slaan with bright green scales, lighter snout coloration, leather armor, wielding bo staff) performs desperate acrobatic dodge, a dwarven slayer (male dwarf with white braided beard to chest, bare scarred muscular torso, red glowing eyes, wielding massive maul named Vierna) braces against the assault with dwarven fortitude, an elderly human chef-warrior (male with wild white hair like storm cloud, weathered face, leather vest, wielding wooden staff and casting defensive magic with glowing shield spell forming) takes the brunt of the attack staggering backward, while a grizzled Norn archer (older male with long gray braided hair and beard, dark facial tattoos, black leather and furs) draws bow ready to return fire. Supernatural misty aura surrounds the drake creating obscuring haze, highland river setting with rocky banks and mountain terrain visible, dramatic lighting as water spray catches afternoon sun creating prismatic effects. Art style: detailed action-focused fantasy painting, sense of desperate combat against apex predator, dynamic water effects and magical energy. Mid-shot capturing the creature's terrifying presence and the heroes' desperate defense.
```

## Context

This captures the near-death experience on the return journey from the highland expedition - an ambush by a Brine Drake that walked across the water's surface and unleashed a devastating breath weapon. The party came within moments of having to retreat, with multiple members pushed to their limits. Qotal would ultimately land the killing blow with incredible precision, but this moment shows them at their most vulnerable.

## Key Elements

- **Characters**: Qotal (lizardfolk monk dodging), Bruldin (dwarven slayer weathering assault), Alrik (elderly chef taking heavy damage), Gierr (Norn archer readying counterattack)
- **Location**: Highland river confluence on return journey
- **Mood**: Desperate danger, primal fear, survival on the edge
- **Visual Focus**: The terrifying moment of the breath weapon attack, the drake walking on water, the heroes' desperate defensive reactions
