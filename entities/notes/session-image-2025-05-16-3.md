# The Bridge of New Beginnings

## Prompt

```
Epic fantasy digital painting, five battle-worn adventurers approach an immense bridge settlement spanning waters as wide as a great river, morning mist rising from the water. The massive stone bridge supports entire buildings clinging to its structure like barnacles. In the foreground: a green-scaled Slaan monk (male with jade scales, travel-worn robes, bo staff and lute), a scarred dwarf slayer (male with ritual scars, carrying massive maul), a pale dhampir investigator (female with noble bearing, twin rapiers, hand crossbow), a tall Norn wanderer (male with weathered features, flute at belt, evil eye symbol), and an elderly human sage (male with kind face, simple robes). Golden sunrise light bathes the bridge-city, contrasting their dirt and blood-stained appearance. Banners flutter from the settlement. Art style: epic vista, detailed architecture, warm lighting suggesting hope after hardship, ArtStation quality. Wide establishing shot showing scale of the crossing.

```
