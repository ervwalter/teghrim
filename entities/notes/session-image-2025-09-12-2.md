```
Epic fantasy digital painting, dwarven slayer in full battle rage (male dwarf with impressive white braided beard flowing to chest, bare scarred muscular torso with leather straps, red glowing eyes, wielding massive warhammer) delivers devastating strike to dire boar's skull, bone shattering and eye socket collapsing from impact, blood spraying across scarred dwarven flesh, the beast's bellow shifting from aggression to fear, boar's thick hide bristling with matted fur, forest combat scene with other party members visible engaging second boar in background, intense dramatic lighting highlighting the moment of crushing impact, flying bone fragments and blood droplets frozen in air. Art style: brutal, painterly, dramatic shadows and highlights, ArtStation quality. Wide shot emphasizing raw power and violent retribution.
