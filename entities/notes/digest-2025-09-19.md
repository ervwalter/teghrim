## Unresolved Questions

1. **Skaven Clan Locations**: Where are the two Skaven clans based near Teghrim's Crossing? Sewers under bridge? Wilderness areas?
2. **Rat Swarm Controllers**: Who or what is controlling the observer rats and coordinating the organized raids? Skaven clan leaders?

4. **Genovian's Location**: Where is the one-eyed emanation leading the party? To Genovian's lair in the waterfall plateau region?
5. **Celtic Druids**: Who are the Celtic druids sending raven messages to Teghrim's Crossing? Why are they watching the party?
6. **Breath of the Nexus Timing**: How long ago was the last Breath? Can Aelysh calculate this to understand why Genovian's emanations persist?
7. **Georgette Identity**: Is "Georgette" the bardish lady a recurring NPC or one-time character?
