# The Silent Observer

## Prompt

```
Epic fantasy digital painting, mysterious bird-like creature perched high in a gnarled tree branch, single massive glowing eye dominating its shadowy avian form, the eye radiating otherworldly light fixed on a battle-weary party below - a wild-haired chef (elderly male human with white hair looking up with recognition), a green-scaled monk (male Slaan lizardfolk), a gothic dhampir (female with pale skin and dark clothing), and a Norse wanderer (male human with long dark hair), the creature's dark feathers seem to absorb light making its form indistinct except for that piercing eye, twisted forest branches creating natural frame, late afternoon light filtering through leaves. Eerie atmospheric lighting with the glowing eye as focal point, dark fantasy art with hints of cosmic horror. Low angle composition emphasizing the creature looking down from above at the party.

```
