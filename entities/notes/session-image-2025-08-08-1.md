# Queen Zelinda's Royal Court

## Prompt

```
Epic fantasy digital painting, theatrical royal audience in elaborate hob settlement. A regal hobgoblin queen (female hobgoblin with royal bearing, ornate robes, multiple protective charms hanging from her attire, crown-like headdress adorned with fetishes and mystical symbols) holds court in grand hut surrounded by smaller dwellings. Four adventurers kneel respectfully before her throne - a green-scaled lizardfolk monk (male Slaan with bright green scales, leather armor with buckles and straps, calm scholarly demeanor), a wild-haired elderly chef (male human with white hair like storm clouds, worn leather vest, wooden staff, weathered face full of character), a muscular dwarven slayer (male dwarf with flowing white braided beard, bare scarred torso, leather bracers, massive warhammer nearby), and a handsome Norse warrior (male human with long dark hair, elaborate blue clothing with golden mystical symbols, bird skull pendant). Queen's settlement backed into defensive tree positions, protective fetishes and charms hanging like supernatural armor from every surface. Waterside location with rafts visible. Warm golden afternoon light filtering through forest canopy, magical realism style emphasizing the theatrical grandeur and accumulated mystical protections. Art style: detailed fantasy illustration with rich colors and ceremonial atmosphere. Wide composition showing the full court scene with emphasis on royal pageantry.
