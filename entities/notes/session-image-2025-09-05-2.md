# Qotal's Spectacular Entrance

## Prompt

```
Epic fantasy digital painting, dramatic moment of spectacular martial technique in gladiatorial arena. A green-scaled lizardfolk monk (male Slaan with bright green reptilian scales, lighter coloration on snout and throat, wearing practical leather armor with straps, wielding bo staff, intelligent reptilian eyes) points directly at massive orc champion (seven-foot warrior with scarred green skin, crude armor, beginning to stagger backward) in classic Babe Ruth showboating gesture before delivering devastating attack. The monk executes perfect acrobatic leap with staff extended, sending the champion crashing prone to the ground with explosive impact. Battle-worn companions visible in mid-ground: scarred dwarven slayer with white beard and massive warhammer, pale dhampir woman in gothic leather with rapier. Hundreds of orcs and goblins erupt in wild approval from forest clearing edges, drums thundering. Dust cloud explodes from champion's impact, dynamic motion lines emphasizing the monk's perfect technique. Art style: painterly, action-focused, ArtStation quality, emphasizing the theatrical showmanship of pointing before striking. Wide shot capturing crowd reaction and dramatic combat choreography, warm firelight from torches contrasting with cool forest darkness.
```
