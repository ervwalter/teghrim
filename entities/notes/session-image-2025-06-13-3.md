# Bruldin's Glowing Vengeance

## Prompt

```
Epic fantasy digital painting, climactic moment in a fungus-filled cave as a dwarven slayer (male dwarf with white braided beard, bare torso covered in ritual scars, fungal growth spreading across his chest) brings his massive warhammer down in a devastating arc, his tattoos blazing with painful blue-white light that illuminates the entire cavern. Below him, a beautiful but terrible myconid (purple mushroom creature with midnight-blue cap edges, unfurling tentacles) splits open like overripe fruit under the impact, releasing a deadly cloud of spores. A wood elf druid (female elf with bronze skin, flowing black hair with vine crown, green nature robes) summons powerful winds that blast the spore cloud toward the cave entrance. In the background, puppet creatures including a wooden leshy and giant beetles collapse as their controller dies. Bioluminescent fungal growths cover every surface in diseased rainbows. Dramatic lighting from the glowing tattoos, dynamic composition capturing the moment of impact. Dark fantasy art style with emphasis on the contrast between corruption and righteous fury.
```

## Context

Bruldin, infected by the myconid's spores, channels his fury into a devastating killing blow while his tattoos flare with supernatural power, as Aelysh uses wind magic to prevent the death spores from dooming them all.
