## Culture & Society
Fetchlings are a mysterious race. It's thought that they have some tie to another plane of existence. It's unknown why, but the Fetchling population appears to have some sort of maximum number (only around 30,000). When the population is near the cap, no new Fetchlings can be born.

They live in the southern mountains of Astoria. Like the Delvin Elves, they are not affected by the Miasma. Unlike the Delvin, they have not been pursued as aggressively by the vampire clans as Fetchling blood is inedible by vampires, and can even be mildly toxic to them. Fetchlings cannot be turned into Vampires.

The mountain cities of the Fetchling are ancient and have grown opulent over time. While there are few reasons for Fetchlings to leave their cities, some do more out of a sense of adventure than any other reason.
