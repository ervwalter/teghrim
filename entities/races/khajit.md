## Culture & Society

The Khajit survived the Dark Times in their ancestral homelands, much like the Leonen did. Unlike the [entity:7763188|Romanus], they have not formed a unified kingdom, and remain a patchwork of small principalities. This is mostly due to the hostile nature of [entity:7763180|Bar-Achi]. A tropical jungle with large seasonal monsoons, it's a verdant land with danger around every tree. Many jokingly refer to it as the only place on [entity:7763144|Septerra] where the Dark Times did not end.

Most Khajit live on the coast or inland rivers, and have forged strong ties with other seafaring peoples. Any progress they've made in taming the jungle has been very slow. It's believed that the Khajit have inhabited Bar-Achi for a very long time, perhaps even back to the eras before the Dark Times. Littered throughout the jungle are the remains of ancient Khajit cities, temples, and settlements. Underneath all of the undergrowth, it's hard to know how much Khajit history lies buried.

In recent times, expeditions into the deep jungles have become popular for archaeologists and treasure seekers. Some Khajit have begun to explore beyond their lands, but on the whole, they have remained focused inward.
