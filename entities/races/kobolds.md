## Culture & Society

As far as monsters go, these tend to be lower on the pecking order. Despite their size, all three [[entity:7763229|goblins], kobolds, and skaven] are known to be sneaky, conniving, and sadistic. However, over time, small groups of them have broken away from rest of their race, and formed small groups that live on the outskirts of the more 'civilized' races. They usually form symbiotic relationships, them providing menial labor and services in exchange for protection and food. Though they've lost the more evil tendencies of their wild cousins, they are still fairly chaotic, and have not fully integrated into their host societies.

Kobold communities can be found on the outskirts of cities in [entity:7763186|Hyboria]. They have a particular talent for mining and trap-making, which makes them valuable despite their reputation.
