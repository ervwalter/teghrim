## Culture & Society
Frost Elves etched out a place to live in the far Northern forests, near the north pole. Over time, they have gained tremendous resistance to the cold, and can wear minimal clothing in the harsh cold and still survive. However, this resistance to cold has made their society lopsided. 

The resistance to cold develops when a child reaches adulthood. As female Frost Elves enter adulthood a few decades earlier than males do, the survival rates for females is much higher. This is quite detrimental to a race that already has a small population. Frost Elves rarely leave their lands.
