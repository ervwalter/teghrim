## Culture & Society

Changelings are one of the most enigmatic races in [entity:7763144|Septerra]. Scholars debate if they are really a race at all and are more of a common occurring aberration. They are not born to changeling families, but rather, almost at random, when members of another ancestry has a child, it will be born as a pale skinned, black eyed child, which has become known as a changeling.

These have no resemblance to the parents who birthed them. While this is odd for the parents, Changelings are often seen as a good luck charm. For some unknown reason, Changelings mature much faster than their siblings. They can learn skills, trades, and languages supernaturally fast, almost as if they had prior knowledge of it.

Changelings are fairly rare, but as they mature fast, they often move away from their parents at a relatively early age. Many are taken to wandering throughout [entity:7763144|Septerra], as if they know the land, but have no memory of it.

Changelings cannot bear children, and many theologians believe that they are tied to a loop of being reincarnated. While they have no memory of their prior lives, some of the skills they learned in prior lives can be re-learned in short order.
