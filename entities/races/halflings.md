## Culture & Society
Halflings are an ancestry of small peoples who have survived throughout history by forming synergistic relations with other races. An extreme love and skill with farming and agriculture has endeared them to other races. This symbiotic relationship sees them able to provide food and farm goods in exchange for protection.

Halflings are mostly known for co-existing with Highland Dwarves, Sylvan elves, both Norn ancestries, and humans of the Iron Kingdoms. Halflings who live among the dwarves and elves are referred to as Gnomes, while those who live among humans and Norn are known as Hobbits. A Halfling's love of the land and things that grow tend to make them more insular, though from time to time, some are known to leave their shires and explore the world.
