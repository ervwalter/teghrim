## Culture & Society
Yautja separated from the ork race far before the Oskin did. They have become so far removed that their faces no longer resemble their ork ancestors, though they still retain their size. The Yautja created a society deep in the jungles of Illuxtria.

The Yautja developed an orderly civilization based on a set of beliefs known as 'The Hunt.' This is a set of beliefs centered around martial improvement with hunting, stalking and trophy taking playing a major role. The purpose being to test one's self against stronger and more menacing prey. This belief does not prevent them from following other gods or demi-gods, as long as the deities' beliefs do not interfere with the Hunt. Some popular gods among the Yautja include Khorn, Aris, and Lilith (whose followers follow the 'Dark Hunt'). In the dense, danger-filled forests of Primordia, the Yautja had the prey they would need to pursue their Hunt.

## The Temple Mystery
Nearly a century ago, a mysterious event led to the abandonment of their main reliquary and temple. At one time this temple complex housed thousands of trophies and legendary artifacts. It played a central role in binding their society. Then, one day, it went silent. When neighboring tribes investigated, they found the place completely abandoned. The complex was devoid of life; all of the relics had disappeared as well. No one really knows what happened. There were no signs of an attack, nor unusual tracks in the vicinity. The complex is now a ghost town; any who try to delve deep into its grounds never returns alive. To further deepen the mystery, the lost artifacts have been found all throughout Septerra.

## Three Factions
The event destroyed the one thing that bound their peoples together. The Yautja have slowly begun to leave their homeland and scatter about Septerra. Over time, they've broken into three factions:

- **The Reclaimers**: Seek to recover the artifacts that have disappeared from the temple. They do this in the belief that by returning them, the curse on the temple will end, and their race can reunite. They've been willing to interact and work with the other intelligent races of Septerra. Prior to the event, these races would have been considered 'prey,' and beneath interacting with. The Reclaimers are the only playable faction.

- **The Rebuilders**: Seek to build a new temple somewhere else in Septerra. They continue to see other races as prey and have no interest in working with them.

- **The Wanderers**: Have given up hope of unifying their race, and roam throughout Septerra pursuing the Hunt and nothing else.

Both the Rebuilders and Wanderers are antagonists.
