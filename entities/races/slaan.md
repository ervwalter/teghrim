## Culture & Society
Ruins belonging to the Slaan ancestors can be found all throughout the world, generally in tropical areas. Even lands as far away as [entity:7763186|Hyboria] and [entity:7763180|Bar-Achi] have ruins. Though maybe not as prominent as the Elves and Dwarves of the Pre-Dark Times, there is little doubt that the Slaan played an important role in that world. However, the Dark Times were also not kind to them, and now they are a much smaller race. The dense jungles of [entity:7763174|Primordia] are the only lands they call home.

It has only been in the last century, after a chance encounter with the [entity:7763226|Nagaji], that the Old Ones (the ancient leaders of the Slaan) have given their blessing for the Slaan to leave their lands. Some Slaan have taken to helping the [entity:7763226|Nagaji] in their growing lands, while others explore the world to learn more about their lost legacy.
