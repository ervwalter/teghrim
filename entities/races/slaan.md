## Culture & Society
Ruins belonging to the Slaan ancestors can be found all throughout the world, generally in tropical areas. Even lands as far away as Hyboria and Bar-Achi have ruins. Though maybe not as prominent as the Elves and Dwarves of the Pre-Dark Times, there is little doubt that the Slaan played an important role in that world. However, the Dark Times were also not kind to them, and now they are a much smaller race. The dense jungles of Primordia are the only lands they call home.

It has only been in the last century, after a chance encounter with the Nagaji, that the Old Ones (the ancient leaders of the Slaan) have given their blessing for the Slaan to leave their lands. Some Slaan have taken to helping the Nagaji in their growing lands, while others explore the world to learn more about their lost legacy.
