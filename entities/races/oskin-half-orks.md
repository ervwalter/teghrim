## Culture & Society
Oskin clans live in Hyboria, but unlike the Stone-Bearer Dwarves, they've not been able to establish a set homeland. Constantly having to weave between constant dangers, they've survived as a nomadic race. They bear a deep grudge against their ork ancestors due to the never-ending conflicts against them. 

Due to their size and physical prowess, they make good mercenaries and sailors. Despite having a relatively low population, it's not uncommon to see an Oskin throughout Septerra.

The ork hordes remain one of the primary antagonists all throughout Septerra. Simple minded, orks have a driving urge to fight, wage war, and conquer others. If an ork remains passive for too long, they can grow sick, and even pass away. While the typical ork is not available to be played, there are two distant relatives of orks that are: the Oskin and the Yautja. Time and distance has made these races far less feral and capable of making relations with the other organized societies around them.
