## Culture & Society

Drow are followers of the demigod [entity:7763140|Lolth]. They are dedicated to the survival of the elven race at any cost (commonly through assassination or manipulation). Many a time has a ravaging ork horde veered off from elven lands after hearing rumors of wealth among the human realms, or a powerful Baron turns up dead, leaving his children to argue amongst themselves rather than invade elven lands. For centuries, the drow took slaves and offered them to the vampires of [entity:7763172|Astoria] in exchange for leaving the [entity:7763202|Delvin (shadow elves)] alone.

Anyone (mostly elves) can become a drow. After being found worthy, they are bitten by a dryder, spun into a cocoon for months, and undergo all sorts of archaic rituals. In time, they emerge as an elf with dark grey, black, or dark blue skin and white hair. Drow cannot have children, and new Drow are only added through this ritual.
