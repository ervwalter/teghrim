## Culture & Society
Nagaji are a race that went extinct long ago. About four hundred years ago, a clutch of Nagaji eggs that were magically preserved was awakened in the mountains near the Golgorun plains. The newly emerged Nagaji took refuge in some abandoned forts on the plain. Over time their population grew, and they soon set up a harbor that became a destination for sea trade in the region. 

Their small kingdom has become a major player in the southern trade route connecting Oceanus to Avenlore. Its ports also have begun to draw in trade from Hyboria and Aegyptus.

The Nagaji are also one of the few races to have contact with Primordia. Early in their re-awakening, they came in contact with Slaan travelers who were sent to their lands after receiving a mystic vision. The Slaan taught them Parceltongue, and have formed a strong bond with them, often serving as protectors and advisors to the fledgling race.

In time, more clutches of magically preserved eggs have been found. Though this added to their population, it remains fairly small. Though not known as mercenaries, Nagaji explorers have been active around Oceanus and Avenlore as they search for other clutches lost in time.
