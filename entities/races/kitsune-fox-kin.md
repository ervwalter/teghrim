Kitsune inhabit a mountainous, bamboo forest located in Oceanus. They live not too far from the Jade Kingdoms, and small Kitsune colonies have sprung up among them. Given to peaceful co-existence with their surroundings, Kitsune tend to be inward focused. However, due to wanderlust or a curious nature, some Kitsune do take to adventuring to explore the world around them.

Kitsune have a love of nature, and a particular interest in the stars, astrology, and the moon. They can shift between the form of a fox and that of a human with fox ears and one (or more) tails.
