Sometime in the middle of the Dark Times, Elves began to inhabit the [entity:7763173|Moonshae Isles], not far from the coasts of [entity:7763186|Hyboria]. They quickly gained dominion, and did quite well for the remainder of the Dark Times. While they were able to drive out any threats, they were not able to build much of a kingdom due to the relatively small size of the Isles.
