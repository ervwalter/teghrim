## Culture & Society
Dhampir originated in Astoria, not long after the conquest of the Vampire. These were originally humans who were bit, but did not fully develop into full vampires. As they were not full vampires, they could move about in full sun, and could easily operate in the world outside of Astoria. Not bound by the Miasma, they first moved to Avenlore and Orientus under orders of the Vampiric houses. Later they would form their own houses in these lands, and eventually, gain their independence.

Most Dhampir are of human origin, though there are some of elven, particularly the Shadow Elves who inhabit the same lands of Astoria. A good number of other races have been brought into Astoria as slaves have also had members who've become Dhampir as well.

Due to the competition, most Dhampir live outside of Astoria. Most of the Dhampir Houses are in the Iron or Jade Kingdoms. There are a few Houses among the Norn. Inside Astoria, Dhampir of Shadow Elf Ancestry have houses among their elven kin.

Unlike Vampire, Dhampir can have children. Most Dhampir are either born of Dhampir parents, or are a mortal that survived the bite of a vampire, but did not fully transform. There are many Dhampir that are independent, but most Dhampir belong to bloodline Houses. An outsider Dhampir can undergo a blood ritual and be welcomed into a House, forming familiar blood bonds with the other members.
