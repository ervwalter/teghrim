# Waterfall Lake

Waterfall Lake is a massive body of water approximately eight miles across, dramatically surrounded by mountains with waterfalls cascading from all sides into the lake. Located in the [entity:8248775|Highland Uplands] where mountains close in on both sides of the river, this natural wonder creates a perpetual mist throughout the area and serves as the setting for a significant dwarven structure on its central island.

## Description

### Physical Layout

The lake spans roughly eight miles across, forming a nearly perfect circular or oval shape bounded by mountains on all sides. Multiple waterfalls feed the lake from higher elevations, creating a constant cascade of water from the surrounding peaks. The geography suggests the river splits at this location, with one branch flowing toward the lake and another hugging the mountains between peaks.

The constant influx of water from the waterfalls creates persistent mist throughout the area, reducing visibility and creating an otherworldly atmosphere. The lake's depth and full extent remain unexplored, though its size and the volume of water flowing into it suggest considerable depth.

### Central Island

At the heart of the lake sits an island approximately 3-4 miles from the nearest shore, accessible only by boat or raft. This island serves as the foundation for massive dwarven ruins that rise from its surface. The presence of a dock extending into the water indicates the structure was designed with water access in mind.

### Atmosphere

The perpetual mist created by the waterfalls, combined with the remote wilderness location and the mysterious dwarven ruins at the center, creates an atmosphere of ancient mystery and hidden secrets. The constant sound of cascading water echoes throughout the basin.

## Background

The lake appears to be a natural formation, though its nearly perfect encirclement by mountains and waterfalls raises questions about possible ancient engineering or magical influence. The presence of substantial dwarven construction on the central island suggests this location held significant importance in ancient times.

Queen Zelinda's lore speaks of "a guardian trapped in a cavern of waterfalls," which the party believes references this location and the ruins at its center. The geography matches descriptions from multiple sources, including an image [entity:7763296|Qotal] found during his research.

## Relationships

- **[entity:8248775|Highland Uplands]**: Located within this wilderness region
- **Island Dwarven Ruins**: Massive structure on central island
- **[entity:7763200|Highland Clan Dwarves]**: Possible ancient connection to the ruins
- **Guardian Legend**: Associated with Queen Zelinda's lore about trapped guardian
- **[entity:7763296|Qotal's] Research**: Location matches his scholarly quest

## Notable History

- **The Discovery** (Orpheus 9th): During their highland expedition, [entity:7763296|Qotal], [entity:7763289|Alrik], [entity:7763295|Bruldin], and [entity:7764100|Gierr] discovered the waterfall-ringed lake after tracking dragon ogres and following the Genovian emanation. The sight of the island ruins in the center excited the party considerably, as it matched [entity:7763296|Qotal's] earlier research images.

- **The Distant Observation**: From their vantage point, the party could see the multi-level dwarven structure on the island and noted a small encampment at its base—tents and fires indicating current occupation by unknown parties. They observed what appeared to be a dock structure extending from the island into the water.

- **The Planning**: Party recognized they would need boats or rafts to access the island, located 3-4 miles from shore across open water. They planned to return with proper equipment and possibly additional party members for a full expedition.

## Current Status

The lake remains largely unexplored despite the party's discovery. The island ruins are currently occupied by unknown individuals or creatures, as evidenced by the visible encampment. Access requires watercraft, and the party has not yet attempted to reach the island or identify its current inhabitants.

The location's distance from [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing]—many miles with mountains in between—makes it a significant expedition target rather than a casual visit.

## Secrets & Mysteries

The identity and purpose of those currently occupying the island ruins remains unknown. The nature of the guardian mentioned in Queen Zelinda's lore has not been confirmed. Whether the waterfalls are entirely natural or enhanced by ancient engineering is unclear. The full extent of the dwarven construction, including any caverns or underground elements referenced in the "cavern of waterfalls" description, awaits exploration. At least one other similar structure may exist, possibly in Primordia though potentially destroyed.
