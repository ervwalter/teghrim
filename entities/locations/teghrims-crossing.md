# Teghrim's Crossing

## Basic Information
- **Type**: Bridge Settlement/Caravanserai
- **Location**: Narrow coast north of Astoria
- **Built**: ~50 years ago
- **Importance**: CAMPAIGN FOCUS LOCATION

## Description
About fifty years ago, a consortium of humans and dwarves began the creation of a road which would pass along the narrow coast north of Astoria. Though fraught with its own dangers, it has the potential to be a viable alternative to connect the Iron Kingdoms and Highland Dwarves to the west, with the Jade Kingdoms and Grey Dwarves to the east.

About halfway between the two lands, a long bridge was built over the Rothehurst River. Named after the dwarven engineer who built it, Teghrim's Crossing was designed to be wide and strong enough to support buildings. With Orc lands to the east of the river, and Bouvok lands to the west, this small settlement was claimed by neither race. About twenty years later, as trade slowly began along the route, the small settlement on the bridge was completed. It now serves as a caravanserai, a shelter and resting place for trade caravans as they pass through.

The settlement presents an impressive sight to arriving travelers: a massive bridge spanning a wide river comparable to the Missouri, with buildings constructed directly upon the bridge structure itself. This unique architecture creates a city that exists entirely over water, combining ancient dwarven engineering with the practical needs of frontier commerce.

## Strategic Importance
- Key point on northern trade route
- Alternative to southern route through Nagaji lands
- Avoids treacherous mountain passes
- Bridge between East and West
- Neutral territory

## Threats
- **East**: Orc lands
- **West**: Bouvok territories
- **General**: Isolated position
- **Constant**: Need for mercenaries

## Current Status
A small, motley band of humans and dwarves protects Teghrim's crossing from any immediate danger. Surrounded by hazards and peril from all sides, there has grown the need for mercenaries and adventurers who would be willing to take up freelance work in the lands encompassing the crossing. Pamphlets and posters have gone up in ports and cities far and wide, seeking any who would answer the call.
