# Teghrim's Crossing

## Basic Information
- **Type**: Bridge Settlement/Caravanserai
- **Location**: Narrow coast north of [entity:7763172|Astoria]
- **Built**: ~50 years ago
- **Importance**: CAMPAIGN FOCUS LOCATION

## Description
### Overview
Teghrim's Crossing is a remarkable bridge settlement spanning the [entity:7763177|Rothehurst River], serving as a crucial caravanserai on the dangerous northern trade route. Built approximately 40 years ago by the dwarven engineer Teghrim, with buildings added 10-15 years later, it represents a unique fusion of ancient dwarven engineering and frontier commerce.

### Physical Layout
The settlement features distinct building types constructed on the massive bridge foundation. The central building houses cooking and dining facilities on the first level, staff rooms above, and attic sleeping areas at the top. Tower buildings contain general stores with both fancy lodging accommodations and hostel bunks for travelers of different means. An administrative tower houses the captain's quarters and command center. The entire settlement is positioned strategically between Bovok territory to the west and Orc territory to the east, with both races claiming land only to the river's edge.

### Architecture
The massive stone bridge serves as the foundation for the entire settlement, wide and strong enough to support substantial buildings. [entity:7763200|Highland Dwarf] guards maintain security, while friendly "helper" [entity:7763229|goblins] maintain a mutualistic relationship with the settlement for wagon repair services, contrasting with the wild [entity:7763229|goblins] that threaten the surrounding areas.

### Operational Features
Carriages and wagons park directly on the bridge structure, while horses are kept on the west side away from orc territories for safety. The settlement includes two river islands: one containing an abandoned house built by the original bridge constructor, and another with guard barracks and fishing equipment for supplemental resources.
