# Annie's Ritual Site

Annie's Ritual Site is the corrupted remains of an abandoned farm east of Teghrim's Crossing, transformed into a center of Diablo worship through dark necromantic practices. The site features a central ritual circle surrounded by defensive stone walls and the remnants of farm buildings, now serving as a monument to the tragic consequences of divine abandonment and desperate vengeance.

## Description

### Physical Layout

The site consists of farm buildings including a house, barn, and stable surrounded by stone walls and formerly cultivated fields. At the center lies a glowing red ritual circle marked with Diablo's symbol, created through blood magic and surrounded by the corpses of sacrificed orcs and goblins. The wheat field was burned to expose the ritual area, leaving charred ground and ash-covered scarecrow remains.

### Atmosphere

A place of palpable supernatural corruption where the air carries the residual stench of death and dark magic. The red glow of the ritual circle creates an ominous ambiance, while the scattered remains of animated constructs serve as reminders of the site's violent recent history.

### Notable Features

- Central Diablo ritual circle with permanent magical corruption
- Stone defensive walls providing tactical cover
- Burned wheat field exposing the full ritual area
- Farm buildings showing signs of both ancient abandonment and recent inhabitation
