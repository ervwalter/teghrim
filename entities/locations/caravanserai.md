# Caravanserai

## Overview
The caravanserai are fortified waystations scattered along the trade routes between Menoth-Derith and Teghrim's Crossing. These essential rest stops provide varying degrees of protection for travelers braving the dangerous frontier roads, though their effectiveness depends greatly on maintenance and location.

## Description
### Physical Layout
Typical caravanserai feature defensive walls with gates, interior courtyards for wagons and animals, and basic shelter structures. Some sites include goblin totems - primitive ward markers that may deter the most superstitious raiders. Quality varies from barely standing ruins to well-maintained defensive positions.

### Atmosphere
These isolated outposts carry an air of wary refuge. Travelers huddle within walls that might protect from casual raiders but prove inadequate against determined assault. The presence of goblin totems adds an unsettling element, reminding visitors of the constant threat beyond the walls.

### Notable Features
- Defensive walls of varying quality and repair
- Gates that may or may not properly secure
- Goblin totems at some locations (like Blair Witch-style constructions)
- Water sources and basic facilities where maintained
- Defensive positions for guards and archers

## Background
Built over generations to facilitate trade through dangerous territories, these waystations represent the ongoing struggle between civilization and wilderness. Some date back centuries while others are recent additions to expanding trade networks.

## Relationships
- **Trade Caravans**: Essential stops for multi-week journeys
- **Goblin Raiders**: Frequent sites of conflict and negotiation
- **Local Settlements**: Maintained through collective merchant investment

## Notable History
- **The First Caravanserai Battle**: Site where the party fought off an orc-led goblin band demanding tolls
- **The Goblin Totem Tradition**: Some locations adopted primitive wards in attempts to avoid conflict

## Current Status
Multiple caravanserai remain in active use along the Menoth-Derith to Teghrim's Crossing route, though their conditions vary widely. Recent increases in goblin organization have made even fortified stops increasingly dangerous.
