# Dragon Ogre Lair

The Dragon Ogre Lair is a cave located in a canyon area within the [entity:8248775|Highland Uplands], serving as the den for dragon ogres hunting in the region. The lair contains evidence of a previous ogre community, suggesting the dragon ogre mutation affected multiple members of an established population.

## Description

### Physical Layout

A cave situated near the end of a canyon in the second hex square of the [entity:8248775|Highland Uplands]. The location provided shelter and storage for the dragon ogres, with the canyon approach offering defensive advantages and concealment from casual observation.

### Contents

The lair houses numerous pelts and ogre-ish equipment remnants from what appears to have been a larger ogre village or community. The quantity and variety of items suggests multiple ogres once occupied this location or the surrounding area before their transformation into dragon ogres. Among the accumulated possessions, the party discovered magical items including a Slick rune, a Teal Spirit Apple, and various gems.

## Background

The lair's contents indicate it belonged to an ogre community that underwent draconic transformation. Whether the transformation occurred gradually or suddenly, and what became of the other ogres, remains unclear. The presence of community equipment suggests this was not simply a dragon ogre hunting den but rather inherited space from their pre-transformation existence.

## Relationships

- **[entity:8244508|Ogres]**: Original inhabitants before dragon ogre transformation
- **Dragon Ogres**: Current or former occupants
- **[entity:8248775|Highland Uplands]**: Location within the wilderness region

## Notable History

- **The Tracking** (Orpheus 7th-8th): After defeating two dragon ogres, [entity:7763296|Qotal], [entity:7763289|Alrik], [entity:7763295|Bruldin], and [entity:7764100|Gierr] spent three days tracking the creatures' trail back through the highlands.

- **The Discovery** (Orpheus 8th): Party located the canyon cave and investigated its contents. They found pelts, equipment from a previous ogre community, and treasure including a Slick rune (45 gold value, +1 bonus to Acrobatics for escape/squeeze), a Teal Spirit Apple (200 gold value, provides bright light and fear save bonus), and gems. The party decided to sell these items rather than use them.

## Current Status

The lair sits empty following the defeat of its dragon ogre occupants on Orpheus 5th-7th. Whether other dragon ogres in the region might claim this territory or if it will attract new inhabitants remains to be seen.

## Secrets & Mysteries

The fate of the other ogres from the original community remains unknown. The draconic source that triggered their transformation into dragon ogres has not been identified. Whether more ogres in the [entity:8248775|Highland Uplands] risk similar transformation is unclear.
