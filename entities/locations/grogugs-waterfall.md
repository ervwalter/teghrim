# Grogug's Waterfall

Grogug's Waterfall is a massive natural landmark near [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing], featuring treacherous stone stairs carved into the cliff face that provide the only known access to the highland plateau above. The waterfall serves as both a natural barrier and toll point, controlled by Grogug the troll who charges for safe passage.

## Description

### Physical Layout

A towering waterfall with ancient stone stairs carved directly into the cliff face beside the cascading water. The stairs are slippery and dangerous, especially in rain, requiring careful navigation and athletic ability to ascend safely. Behind the waterfall itself lies a cave or alcove where Grogug makes his home, emerging to confront travelers attempting to use the stairs.

### Atmosphere

The constant roar of falling water creates an imposing atmosphere, while the mist and spray make the carved stairs treacherous. The combination of natural danger and Grogug's presence makes this a formidable obstacle for those seeking to reach the highlands above.

### Notable Features

- **Troll's Lair**: Cave behind the waterfall where Grogug resides
- **Highland Access**: Only known route to the plateau and lake region above
- **Natural Barrier**: Waterfall creates defensive position and choke point

## Background

The stone stairs suggest ancient construction, possibly connected to the time when [entity:7766459|hobs] lived further up near the lake before their migration. Grogug established himself as toll keeper at this strategic location, learning Common from local hob communities.

## Current Status

Active toll point controlled by Grogug, who charges "1 gold per person or 1 person as meal" for passage.

The stairs remain dangerous regardless of toll payment, requiring physical prowess to navigate safely.
