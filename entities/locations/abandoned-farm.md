# Abandoned Farm

The Abandoned Farm is a pioneer homestead located east of Teghrim's Crossing that was established by a farming family who disappeared approximately one to two months ago. The site has become a focal point of dark supernatural activity, featuring evidence of both recent inhabitation and disturbing ritual practices.

## Description

### Physical Layout

A typical frontier homestead consisting of a log cabin main house, barn, stable, and wheat field surrounded by basic fencing. The buildings show signs of both old damage from the original family's disappearance and recent use by an unknown occupant. The wheat field contains a cleared ritual circle at its center.

### Atmosphere

An unsettling location where signs of normal farm life mix with evidence of supernatural corruption. The contrast between mundane agricultural buildings and the dark ritual circle creates an atmosphere of violated innocence and creeping evil.

### Notable Features

- **Main House**: Ransacked log cabin with hidden compartments containing vials and torn journal pages
- **Barn**: Shows recent signs of inhabitation with makeshift sleeping arrangements and mysterious blood writings on walls
- **Stable**: Contains months-old animal droppings but no animals
- **Wheat Field**: Site of Diablo ritual circle surrounded by dead orc and goblin bodies
- **Scarecrow Effigies**: Multiple straw figures positioned throughout field, some bearing green blood from fighting

## Background

Established by a pioneer family seeking to create a new life in the dangerous eastern territories beyond Teghrim's Crossing. The farm operated for a brief period before the family's mysterious disappearance coincided with increased orc and goblin activity in the region.

## Relationships

- **Missing Farm Family**: Original owners who established and worked the land
- **Annie**: Daughter of the farming family, possibly the recent inhabitant
- **Diablo Cultists**: Unknown group responsible for the ritual circle
- **Local Monsters**: Site of conflicts between orcs, goblins, and scarecrow constructs

## Notable History

- **The Pioneer Settlement**: Family established homestead in frontier territory
- **The Mysterious Disappearance**: Family stopped all communication 1-2 months ago
- **The Recent Inhabitation**: Evidence suggests female humanoid has been living in barn
- **The Ritual Circle**: Diablo worship site created using orc and goblin deaths
- **The Scarecrow Battle**: Animated straw constructs fought and killed multiple humanoid attackers
- **The Burning**: Search party destroyed scarecrows and burned wheat field to expose ritual site

## Current Status

Abandoned and partially destroyed, with the wheat field burned and scarecrow effigies eliminated. The ritual circle remains intact but exposed, while the buildings show evidence of recent but now-ceased inhabitation. The site represents an ongoing supernatural threat requiring further investigation.

## Secrets & Mysteries

The fate of the original farming family, the identity of the recent inhabitant, the creator of the Diablo ritual, and the connection between the farm's abandonment and the appearance of dangerous creatures in the area all remain unresolved. The purpose of the ritual and whether it has been completed or interrupted poses additional questions about future threats.
