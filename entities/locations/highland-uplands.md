# Highland Uplands

The Highland Uplands is a wilderness region above [entity:8051164|Grogug's Waterfall], accessible only by climbing the treacherous stone stairs beside the cascade. This elevated plateau marks a psychological and physical boundary between settled frontier lands and true wilderness, featuring ancient ruins, dangerous wildlife, and a peculiar "gate closing" sensation that separates travelers from the familiar world below.

## Description

### Physical Layout

A ravine system where the river splits into two branches—one flowing toward a lake, the other hugging the mountains between peaks. From the top of the waterfall ascent, spectacular vistas reveal [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing] appearing tiny as ants far below, along with [entity:7764198|Osanna's mansion] and the river valley. The terrain transitions from the dramatic waterfall entrance into more open highland country marked by ancient hob ruins and burial grounds.

### Atmosphere

Upon emerging from the ravine at the top of the waterfall, travelers experience a distinctive psychological phenomenon—the world "opens up" ahead while looking back creates a "closed gate" sensation. The familiar valley and settled lands can no longer be seen, creating a tangible sense of crossing from civilization into untamed wilderness. This boundary feeling reinforces the Highland Uplands' role as the edge of the known world.

### Notable Features

- **Gateway Sensation**: Psychological boundary effect separating lowlands from highlands
- **River Confluence**: Splitting waterways leading to lake and mountain regions
- **Ancient Hob Ruins**: Settlement remains from approximately 50 years ago
- **Burial Grounds**: Poorly maintained hob graves showing disturbance
- **Spectacular Vistas**: Overlooks providing views of entire valley below
- **Ogre Territory**: Current home to dangerous ogre and dragon ogre populations
- **Waterfall Lake**: Massive eight-mile lake surrounded by waterfalls with Island Dwarven Ruins at center
- **Dragon Ogre Lair**: Canyon cave containing evidence of ogre mutations from draconic influence
- **Mountain Path**: Large trampled path with stone guideposts leading to distant cave entrance

## Background

Approximately 50 years ago, [entity:7766459|hobs] lived in this highland area before migrating down to settle near the bridge when it was constructed. Even then, the hobs were not native to this region—they used it as a waypoint in their larger migration from eastern homelands, not as an original homeland. The hobs' departure left behind crude buildings and burial grounds that have since been disturbed, either through natural decay or grave robbery.

## Relationships

- **[entity:8051164|Grogug's Waterfall]**: Only known access point from lowlands
- **[entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing]**: Nearest civilization, visible far below
- **[entity:7766459|Hob Communities]**: Former inhabitants who migrated downward
- **[entity:8248706|Genovian]**: Espada who once lived in this region, one-eyed birds lead toward mountain cave
- **Waterfall Lake**: Major discovery with Island Dwarven Ruins at center
- **Dragon Ogres**: Mutated ogres inhabit canyon areas
- **Brine Drake**: Aquatic predator in river systems
- **Mountain Range**: Borders the eastern side with path leading to cave entrance

## Notable History

- **The Hob Occupation**: Approximately 50 years ago, hobs settled here as waypoint in migration
- **The Bridge Construction**: Completion of the great bridge prompted hobs to migrate downward to current settlements
- **The Settlement Abandonment**: Hobs left behind crude buildings and burial grounds
- **The Grave Disturbances**: Burial sites show signs of poor maintenance or robbery
- **The Party Exploration**: Adventurers discovered ruins and Animal Staff on Orpheus 5th
- **The Ogre Encounter**: Party fought three ogres in highland territory
- **The Highland Expedition** (Orpheus 5th-12th): [entity:7763296|Qotal], [entity:7763289|Alrik], [entity:7763295|Bruldin], and [entity:7764100|Gierr] conducted week-long exploration mapping multiple hex squares and following Genovian emanation southeast
- **The Dragon Ogre Discovery** (Orpheus 5th-7th): Party encountered and defeated two dragon ogres, learning about their glowing energy mechanic and resistance to physical damage. Creatures spoke unknown language, possibly Draconic.
- **The Lair Tracking** (Orpheus 7th-8th): Three-day expedition tracked dragon ogres to canyon lair containing pelts and equipment from previous ogre community, evidence of multiple ogres transformed by draconic influence
- **The Waterfall Lake Discovery** (Orpheus 9th): Party discovered massive eight-mile lake surrounded by waterfalls with Island Dwarven Ruins on central island. Location matched [entity:7763296|Qotal's] research and Queen Zelinda's guardian lore. Observed occupied encampment at ruins' base.
- **The Musical Communication** (Orpheus 10th): One-eyed birds responded to Willow Dryad's song by stomping rhythmically before flying toward distant mountain cave entrance, revealing connection to that location
- **The Brine Drake Ambush** (Orpheus 10th): Party ambushed by water-walking aquatic creature at river confluence during return journey. Barely survived combat with frightful presence and breath weapon attacks.

## Current Status

Wild and dangerous region inhabited by ogres, dragon ogres, and other threats including Brine Drakes in waterways. The ancient hob ruins stand as silent testament to past habitation, while the disturbed burial grounds suggest either careless abandonment or deliberate grave robbery. The psychological "gateway" effect continues to mark this as the boundary between civilization and wilderness, where travelers leave behind the familiar comforts of settled lands.

Recent week-long expedition (Orpheus 5th-12th) mapped multiple hex squares and discovered Waterfall Lake with its Island Dwarven Ruins—a major breakthrough matching [entity:7763296|Qotal's] research. The ruins remain unexplored due to water access requirements, but represent urgent priority for future investigation. Dragon ogre lair in canyon area suggests draconic influence affecting local ogre populations. Mountain path with guideposts leads to cave where one-eyed birds flew, indicating connection to Genovian emanation.

## Secrets & Mysteries

The source of the psychological "gate closing" sensation remains unexplained—whether it represents a natural boundary phenomenon or some magical effect is unknown. The connection between this region and [entity:8248706|Genovian] the Espada suggests possible ley line or elemental significance.
