# Cursed Stone Formation

The Cursed Stone Formation is a dangerous supernatural site in the Weeping Woods exploration area, featuring a skull-shaped rock arrangement with a magical control rune at its center. The formation emanates a powerful necrotic field that damages living creatures within approximately thirty feet, serving as both the lair of [entity:7888221|the Jailor] and a source of undead corruption spreading through the region.

## Description

### Physical Layout

A barren clearing completely devoid of vegetation, centered around a distinctive skull-shaped arrangement of stones. At the heart of this formation sits a magical rune stone that appears to control the necrotic damage field. The area extends roughly thirty feet from the central point, with the damaging effects beginning at the clearing's edge.

### Atmosphere

An oppressive aura of death permeates the location, with the very air feeling hostile to life. The complete absence of plant life creates an unnatural void in the otherwise verdant forest. The skull shape of the stones suggests deliberate placement rather than natural formation, implying dark ritualistic purposes.

### Notable Features

- **Central Rune Stone**: Magical control stone that cannot be approached due to severe damage field
- **Skull Configuration**: Stones arranged in clear skull pattern visible from above
- **Necrotic Field**: Deals void/necrotic damage to living creatures within ~30 feet
- **Barren Ground**: Complete absence of vegetation within the affected area
- **Force Field Barrier**: Invisible barrier that prevents approach to the central rune

## Background

The formation's origins remain mysterious, though its connection to [entity:7888221|the Jailor] suggests it may serve as an anchor point or power source for the massive construct. The deliberate skull shape implies intelligent design rather than natural occurrence or accidental magic.

## Relationships

- **[entity:7888221|The Jailor]**: Uses the location as a lair, massive footprints lead to and from the site
- **[entity:7921762|Old Gus]**: The bear's undead resurrection likely connected to the formation's corrupting influence
- **Regional Wildlife**: Source of undead corruption affecting nearby creatures
- **Weeping Woods**: Part of the dangerous exploration area beyond [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing]

## Notable History

- **The Discovery**: Found by adventuring party while investigating [entity:7921763|Old Willy's] bear problem
- **The Failed Approach**: Party nearly died attempting to reach the central rune, forced to retreat due to severe necrotic damage
- **The Jailor Tracks**: Fresh tracks confirmed the massive construct uses this location regularly
- **The Corruption Spread**: Identified as source of undead activity in the region, including [entity:7921762|Old Gus's] resurrection

## Current Status

Active threat requiring specialized magical or divine intervention to neutralize. The force field prevents conventional attempts at destruction, while the necrotic damage makes prolonged exposure lethal. Various experts at [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing] have proposed solutions including vampire assistance, positive energy devices, and divine magic.

## Secrets & Mysteries

The formation's creator, original purpose, and connection to [entity:7888221|the Jailor] remain unknown. Whether the construct created the formation, was drawn to it, or was bound to it through external forces requires further investigation. The specific properties of the central rune and potential methods for its safe destruction or control present ongoing challenges.
