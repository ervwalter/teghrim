# Chapter 1 - The Bridge and the Bloodline

Salt spray kissed the weathered planks of the trading vessel as it cut through iron-grey waters, carrying [entity:7763290|Arnor Josefson] away from the familiar shores of [entity:7763868|Ni]. The [entity:7763211|Norn] wanderer stood at the rail, his weathered features drawing curious glances from sailors who whispered of old magic and northern mysteries. Their superstitions seemed almost quaint compared to what awaited on distant shores.

Near the cabin, [entity:7763693|Sylvia Mournhold] adjusted her fine armor with practiced precision, the matched rapiers at her hips catching morning light. Everything about her spoke of wealth and purpose—from the noble bearing to the way she held herself apart from the common sailors. When [entity:7763290|Arnor] attempted to engage the crew in dice games, she watched with the detached interest of someone cataloging future assets.

Days blurred together on the voyage, marked only by the sailors' growing tension and the gradual appearance of [entity:7763870|Menoth-Derith's] cliff-carved harbor. The new [entity:7763209|Duergar] port rose from the coastline like a defiant fist, its fresh-hewn buildings declaring civilization's intent to tame the frontier.

Far to the east, dust devils danced across the caravan road as [entity:7763296|Qotal] walked beside creaking wagons loaded with [entity:7763168|Jade Kingdoms] silk and spices. The [entity:7763230|Slaan] monk's scaled skin gleamed jade in the harsh sun, drawing fewer stares here where exotic travelers were common currency.

"Hi, how are you doing?" The voice belonged to [entity:7763866|Lyn Chong], an elderly gentleman whose warm demeanor set him apart from the ascetic monks [entity:7763296|Qotal] had known. "We don't see many of your kind coming through here."

"I am called Qotal."

"Well, well met. I am Lyn." The old man's eyes twinkled with genuine curiosity. "You are on this journey for sightseeing, I guess?"

[entity:7763296|Qotal's] response carried the weight of prophecy. "No. [entity:7763144|Gia's] whispers carried me here to trace a line carved in stone, a line that ends somewhere beyond. Until I reach it, my journey and yours align."

[entity:7763866|Lyn] nodded slowly, recognizing a fellow traveler on paths both physical and spiritual. The reference to [entity:7763144|Gia]—the earth mother known by many names—marked the monk as more than mere wanderer.

In [entity:7763870|Menoth-Derith], [entity:7763295|Bruldin Grimstone] waited with the patience of stone itself. The dwarven slayer's scarred flesh told stories of battles survived and deaths courted, each mark a badge of honor in the ancient tradition of his cult. When the caravan master approached, his eyes lingered on those scars with professional appreciation.

"I hear there's good fighting out west," [entity:7763295|Bruldin] rumbled, hefting his maul with casual menace. "Should be a good time out there."

"Ah, yes, well we could definitely use one of your type." The caravan master's relief was palpable. [entity:7763122|Dwarven Slayers] commanded respect even among the [entity:7763865|Vanguard Mercenaries] with their ridiculous codpieces and impractical armor.

As disparate groups converged—[entity:7763290|Arnor] and [entity:7763693|Sylvia] from the sea, [entity:7763296|Qotal] and [entity:7763866|Lyn] from the east, [entity:7763295|Bruldin] from his patient vigil—the caravan master made his proposition clear. Guard the rear for free passage and gold at journey's end. Simple terms for what would prove far from simple work.

---

The abandoned [entity:7763869|caravanserai] squatted like a broken tooth against the forest's edge, its walls decorated with crude goblin totems that promised safety through superstition. [entity:7763294|Aurelia] had arrived days ago, using the waystation's isolation to pursue her own investigations. The dhampir's enhanced senses caught the snotlings' approach long before their grubby fingers began probing the ruins.

Three of them, barely larger than children, their curiosity turning to violence with the mercurial nature of their kind. Tiny daggers flashed in dirty hands as they rushed her hiding spot. [entity:7763294|Aurelia's] response was swift and lethal—a blur of motion that left three small corpses cooling in the dust. She drank deeply, their thin blood barely worth the effort, before disposing of the evidence. Even inferior vintage served when necessity demanded.

When the caravan arrived the next afternoon, she emerged from shadows to join the rear guard without explanation. The [entity:7763865|Vanguard Mercenaries] eyed her warily—vampyr were rare enough to inspire caution, common enough to tolerate when traveling dangerous roads.

As twilight painted the sky crimson, the party worked to secure their shelter. [entity:7763295|Bruldin] drove stakes with rhythmic precision, each blow accompanied by fragments of dwarven drinking songs. "The ale was flat, the gold was cursed, but damn it I'd do it again!" His fortifications transformed the entrance into a bristling hedge of sharpened wood.

[entity:7763296|Qotal] wove tripwires with an acrobat's precision while [entity:7763290|Arnor] struggled with damp wood that refused his attempts at trap-setting. [entity:7763866|Lyn] moved through the space spreading incense and murmuring prayers, his efforts complementing rather than replacing the martial preparations. [entity:7763693|Sylvia] directed repairs with the ease of someone accustomed to command, her workers responding to crisp orders that brooked no delay.

Night fell like a curtain, bringing with it the sounds that haunted frontier darkness. [entity:7763295|Bruldin] stood first watch, his tattoos dim in the moonlight, when crashes and cursing erupted from beyond the perimeter. The language was unmistakable—Goblinish, spoken with the particular inflection of someone discovering their plans had gone awry.

The dwarf's javelin sang through the air, a warning shot that prompted immediate response. "Oi, what's going on? What do you thinks you're doing and sending that stuff our ways?"

"Well, what you're doing by our camp? We're trying to sleep out here."

The orc that emerged from darkness stood massive even by his species' standards, a great maul resting easily on one shoulder. Snotlings cowered at his feet—the survivors of whatever scouting party [entity:7763294|Aurelia] had decimated earlier.

"Now, uh, it would not be right for me if I didn't go in there and see what's gone on. Um, and after all this caravan's gone through our territory and you haven't, uh, paid the toll."

[entity:7763295|Bruldin's] tattoos began to glow, faint light pulsing with his rising anger. "It's a free road, no toll, not for you."

The orc's attention shifted to [entity:7763296|Qotal], confusion plain on his tusked face. "What? He's even greener than us. How'd you get him? You're the most strange kind of orc I ever saw."

"It's not about the color of your skin but the content of your character," [entity:7763294|Aurelia] interjected, her voice carrying the weight of old nobility even as she tensed for violence.

"I tend to stay in the shadow," [entity:7763290|Arnor] added, though whether he meant it as threat or explanation remained unclear.

[entity:7763295|Bruldin] ended negotiations with dwarven directness, slamming his maul against his palm. "The only toll you'll get is from old Bessie here."

The orc's expression hardened. "Well, I was gonna be nice... Well, was gonna try doing this the nice way, but, uh, well I suppose we're just gonna have to, uh, come in and extract our toll, um, as it is."

His maul struck the gate with earth-shaking force. Chains snapped like overtaxed sinew, and the barrier swung wide to admit violence.

---

Goblins poured through the breach in pairs, their movements suggesting practiced coordination rather than mindless assault. The orc commander followed, his massive frame blocking moonlight as battle erupted in the confined space.

[entity:7763295|Bruldin's] rage ignited instantly, his first strike combining physical might with spiritual fury. A goblin simply ceased to exist, its body painting the defensive stakes with gore. But numbers told their own story—while the dwarf's maul sang death songs, smaller blades found gaps in his defense. Attackers from multiple sides wore him down with cuts that individually meant nothing but collectively drained his strength.

[entity:7763296|Qotal] moved like water between enemies, his staff work precise as calligraphy. Each strike flowed into the next, dropping goblins with mechanical efficiency. Yet even his grace couldn't prevent the orc's massive maul from finding its mark, sending the monk sprawling into unconsciousness.

[entity:7763290|Arnor] wove magic into the night, conjured missiles carrying cold iron's bite to pierce the orc's thick hide. When both frontline fighters fell, desperation colored his voice. "Natvig, help!"

The response defied explanation—a creature burst from the forest, its form indistinct as it swooped over the combatants. Whatever [entity:7763867|Natvig] was, its presence disrupted the orc's defenses at the crucial moment.

[entity:7763294|Aurelia] didn't waste the opportunity. Her blade found the gap between the orc's eyes with vampiric precision, ending his threat in a spray of dark blood. The surviving goblins, seeing their leader fall, scattered into the night with one proclaiming revolutionary fervor even as death claimed him.

[entity:7763866|Lyn Chong] and the caravan healers worked through the night, coaxing the fallen back from death's edge. By morning, wounds had closed and strength returned, though the memory of how close they'd come lingered like smoke.

Days passed in wary travel through primeval forest where the ground trembled with distant footfalls of giants and mammoths. When they reached a more secure [entity:7763869|caravanserai], relief painted itself across every face. Here, with proper walls and vigilant guards, they could lower their shields slightly.

Firelight danced across gathered faces as [entity:7763296|Qotal] produced his lute, fingers finding familiar melodies. Simple songs emerged—tales of millers and werewolves, of maidens fair and monsters foul. [entity:7763290|Arnor's] flute wove counterpoint while [entity:7763866|Lyn] hummed along, offering flower tea that tasted of distant mountains.

[entity:7763693|Sylvia] watched with the same calculating gaze she'd worn aboard ship. "You guys had fought well. I had heard the prowess of the [entity:7763209|Duergar]. I had never seen you in action, however."

[entity:7763295|Bruldin] launched into his tale with gusto. "Yes, I once killed a troll myself. One of my arms was tied behind my back, but I had my hand in a beard and I wrapped it around its neck and strangled it!"

As introductions deepened into revelations, [entity:7763296|Qotal] spoke of his quest. "A moss-eaten statue of a dwarven warrior clutching a broken hammer... I believe that the whispers hint that the broken hammer's story ends somewhere beyond these hills."

The change in [entity:7763295|Bruldin] was immediate—his boisterous nature retreating like tide from shore. Whatever the broken hammer meant, it struck deeper than any goblin's dagger.

[entity:7763866|Lyn] filled the sudden silence with his own purpose. "I am seeking [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing]. The [entity:7763168|Jade Kingdoms] had helped build the road... rumors of shrine of great healing and divine power."

"I'm just here on family business," [entity:7763693|Sylvia] added with the resignation of younger children everywhere. "I was voluntold to go here and see to our family's duties."

[entity:7763290|Arnor] kept his words simple. "I'm Arnor Josefsson of [entity:7763178|Solstheim]. Looking for my fortune, wandering the world."

[entity:7763294|Aurelia] folded origami with practiced fingers, each crane and flower perfect despite her divided attention. "Investigating. Looking into something for a friend."

---

The [entity:7763864|goblin raiders] struck again as [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing] drew near, their organization suggesting this was no random banditry. Sling stones rained from forest cover, forcing the party to return fire while racing wagons bounced over ancient [entity:7763209|dwarven] roads.

[entity:7763290|Arnor's] evil eye symbol sent younger goblins fleeing in superstitious terror while [entity:7763295|Bruldin's] reputation preceded him like a wave. But true horror arrived on eight legs—goblin cavalry mounted on giant spiders, their approach heralded by the bizarre bouncing of squigs. These mouth-creatures defied description, essentially ambulatory maws with just enough leg to propel them toward prey.

[entity:7763294|Aurelia] fell twice in the running battle, her dhampir constitution the only thing standing between her and true death. [entity:7763866|Lyn's] healing touch proved as valuable as any warrior's blade, dragging her back from unconsciousness even as spider riders pressed their attack.

The party's escape came through desperation and skill combined—every trick employed, every advantage pressed. When the goblin pursuit finally broke off, relief was palpable as morning mist.

[entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing] rose before them like a promise fulfilled. The bridge spanned waters wide as the Missouri, its length supporting not just passage but entire buildings that clung to its structure like barnacles to a ship's hull. After three weeks of danger and blood, they had arrived.

Ten gold pieces each—a pittance for what they'd endured, a fortune for what they'd begun. As they crossed that mighty bridge, none could say what futures awaited in this frontier settlement. But bonds forged in goblin blood and midnight battles would prove stronger than any bridge's stone, and the mysteries each carried—[entity:7763296|Qotal's] broken blade, [entity:7763294|Aurelia's] investigation, [entity:7763290|Arnor's] connection to creatures that answered desperate calls—would soon demand answers.

[entity:7763693|Sylvia] departed to attend to her family's duties in the settlement, her military bearing and noble connections drawing her toward the administrative district where the bridge's commerce and politics intersected. The others would see her again soon enough, but for now, their paths diverged as frontier life sorted them into separate rhythms.

The bridge beneath their feet thrummed with the passage of countless souls seeking fortune or fleeing failure. Among them now walked four more—[entity:7763296|Qotal], [entity:7763295|Bruldin], [entity:7763294|Aurelia], and [entity:7763290|Arnor]—their stories just beginning to interweave with the greater tapestry of [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing] and the lands beyond.
