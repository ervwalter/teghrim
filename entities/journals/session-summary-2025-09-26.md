# Highland Depths and Waterfall Wonders

## Session Overview

The party completed their week-long expedition through the [entity:8248775|Highland Uplands], following [entity:8248706|Genovian's] emanation southeast into unexplored wilderness. Their journey revealed the location [entity:7763296|Qotal] had been seeking—massive dwarven ruins on an island in a waterfall-ringed lake—and a mysterious mountain path leading to caves where the one-eyed birds originate. The expedition nearly ended in disaster when a fearsome Brine Drake ambushed them during their return journey.

## Story Developments

The party began on Orpheus 5th already deep in the [entity:8248775|Highland Uplands], tracking draconic footprints along the river. The recording started mid-exploration with [entity:7763296|Qotal], [entity:7763289|Alrik], [entity:7763295|Bruldin], and [entity:7764100|Gierr Bjornson] having discovered tracks from two four-legged creatures moving through the wilderness. Following the trail, they encountered their first highland threat—**dragon ogres**.

These abominations appeared as draconic centaurs, horse-like bodies merged with dragon features. One carried a halberd, the other a maul. [entity:7763296|Qotal] attempted diplomacy, calling out "I choose... I am called Kotal" and requesting the creatures approach peacefully. But the dragon ogres responded in an unknown language—possibly Draconic—and charged with raised weapons, clearly hostile.

The battle revealed the creatures' unique abilities. Red glowing energy imbued their body parts—weapons, claws, tail—providing devastating bonus damage on successful hits. This energy disappeared only after landing strikes, persisting through misses and critical failures. The creatures' resistance to piercing and bludgeoning damage made them difficult to bring down, forcing the party to adapt their tactics throughout the extended combat.

[entity:7763289|Alrik] used **Recall Knowledge** with his Dubious Knowledge feat, learning "these things are known as dragon ogres" and "they can breathe fire." Post-combat, the GM clarified the truth—dragon ogres are ogres mutated by proximity to draconic sources like dragons or dragon bones. They mimic dragon abilities but don't actually possess fire breath. The first dragon ogre fell to [entity:7763289|Alrik's] spiritual weapon scoring a critical hit, while the second required concentrated effort from the entire party.

The second dragon ogre proved more dangerous, landing a devastating critical hit on [entity:7763296|Qotal] with its glowing claw attack. [entity:7763295|Bruldin's] **intimidating glare** frightened the massive creature, while [entity:7764100|Gierr's] arrows and the party's coordinated assault eventually brought it down. The combat tested their stamina but ended in victory.

Rather than immediately continuing their exploration, [entity:7763295|Bruldin] suggested tracking the creatures to their lair to ensure the area was clear of threats. His exceptional survival check—rolling 30—allowed them to follow the trail accurately over multiple days. On Orpheus 8th, three days of careful tracking led them to a canyon cave near the end of the second hex square.

The **Dragon Ogre Lair** contained numerous pelts and equipment from what appeared to be a previous ogre community. The quantity suggested these dragon ogres had originated from a larger population affected by draconic influence in the highlands. Among the accumulated possessions, they discovered a **Slick rune** providing acrobatics bonuses, a **Teal Spirit Apple** that created bright light and fear resistance, and various gems. After brief consideration, the party decided to sell these items rather than use them, adding modest gold to their expedition funds.

On Orpheus 9th, their exploration led to the expedition's first major discovery. As the mountains closed in on both sides of the river, a breathtaking vista opened before them—a massive lake fed by waterfalls cascading from all sides, mist filling the air from the constant spray. And in the center of the lake, on an island roughly three to four miles from shore, stood the structure [entity:7763296|Qotal] had been seeking.

The **Island Dwarven Ruins** matched perfectly the image from [entity:7763296|Qotal's] scholarly research—the moss-eaten statue with the broken hammer that had drawn him to the frontier. [entity:7763295|Bruldin] immediately recognized it as a dwarven hold despite its distance and ruined state. A dock extended from the island into the water, and most intriguingly, small tents and fires were visible at the base of the structure. Someone—or something—currently occupied the ancient ruins.

The party recalled previous lore about this location. King Jareth had spoken of guardians who warned that "evil hearts must pay the price." Queen Zelinda told of "a royal guard whose ego trapped them in a cavern of waterfalls." The [entity:7766459|hobs] held deep superstitions about such structures, carving little statues and believing them cursed particularly for dwarves. [entity:7763296|Qotal] declared with certainty: "This is my new home base. We're going to liberate it." The multi-level structure promised exploration for the future, but first they needed boats or rafts to cross the eight-mile lake.

Continuing their circuit around the highlands, the party discovered another significant location. A large trampled path—not quite a road but clearly not natural—ran out of the mountains for two to three miles before winding back up into the peaks. Stone guideposts lined the route where lanterns could theoretically be placed. Looking up toward the distant heights, they spotted a cave entrance at the path's terminus.

As they studied this mysterious mountain road, several of the one-eyed birds appeared in nearby trees. One familiar bird—the same one that had stomped to music before—began its rhythmic dance. [entity:7763289|Alrik] broke out his instruments to perform the melody [entity:7764101|the Willow Dryad] had taught them, the song [entity:8248706|Genovian] herself had shared with forest spirits long ago. His performance check succeeded admirably, and the bird stomped in rhythm while other misty-looking one-eyed birds joined from surrounding trees. When the song ended, the birds dissolved into mist and flew up the mountain path toward the distant cave, providing a clear indication of where [entity:8248706|Genovian's] emanations originated.

The party updated their notes carefully. They had found the dwarven ruins by the waterfalls. They had discovered the road leading to the mountains. [entity:7763296|Qotal's] quest was progressing significantly. With their major discoveries catalogued, they began the journey back to [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing] on Orpheus 10th.

## Combat & Challenges

The return journey proved far more dangerous than the expedition out. As the party crisscrossed back toward the river on Orpheus 10th, they heard splashing in the water. Perception checks gave [entity:7763289|Alrik] and [entity:7763295|Bruldin] just enough warning—both rolling 22—to avoid being caught completely off-guard, though [entity:7763296|Qotal's] 13 left him less prepared.

A **Brine Drake** emerged from the river, walking atop the water surface as if it were solid ground. The aquatic dragon-like creature moved with predatory grace, and before anyone could react fully, it unleashed its breath weapon—a straight line of devastating water-based energy. Reflex saves determined damage, with failures taking 33 points while successes halved it to 16. [entity:7763296|Qotal] rolled natural 1, used a hero point, and succeeded with 28. [entity:7763295|Bruldin] also succeeded with 24. [entity:7763289|Alrik] critically failed with 12, burning another hero point to reduce the result to a simple failure.

Then the creature's **frightful presence** aura triggered. Will saves across the party determined their fear levels—success meant frightened 1, failure frightened 2. [entity:7763289|Alrik] succeeded with 29, [entity:7763296|Qotal] failed with 20, and [entity:7764100|Gierr] succeeded with 26. Mercifully, all became immune to the fear effect for the rest of combat after that first save, preventing ongoing psychological pressure.

The battle intensified as the Brine Drake demonstrated why aquatic dragons were feared. It entered frenzy mode, attacking with multiple claw strikes and tail sweeps. A critical hit on [entity:7763295|Bruldin] dealt 34 damage, forcing him to burn resolve points using his **Steel Your Resolve** feat—spending precious resources to regain stamina three separate times throughout the fight. The misty aura surrounding the creature reappeared whenever it successfully struck opponents, adding to its otherworldly menace.

[entity:7763289|Alrik's] holy fire spells proved effective, dealing 21 fire damage with successful attacks. [entity:7764100|Gierr] landed a critical hit with his crossbow for 26 damage after his first shot missed. The party coordinated their assault while managing the creature's varying reach—some attacks could strike from distance while others required close proximity, forcing constant tactical adjustments.

The breath weapon recharged mid-combat, catching multiple party members in its devastating spray once more. The party discussed afterward how close they came to death—several mentioned being "almost dead" and acknowledged they would have retreated if the combat had continued much longer. [entity:7763295|Bruldin's] three uses of Steel Your Resolve kept him standing through punishment that would have dropped most warriors.

Finally, [entity:7763296|Qotal] rolled double natural 20s on his attacks, dealing 57 points of devastating damage that killed the Brine Drake outright. The creature collapsed, and the party stood victorious but severely depleted. When they attempted to identify what they'd fought, every recall knowledge check failed—[entity:7763296|Qotal] rolled 20, another party member 17, and [entity:7764100|Gierr] critically failed with 2. Unable to learn more through conventional means, [entity:7763296|Qotal] sketched the creature in his ever-present sketchbook, preserving its image for future research.

## Discoveries & Lore

The week-long expedition yielded multiple discoveries that reshaped the party's understanding of the [entity:8248775|Highland Uplands] and their ongoing quests. The **Island Dwarven Ruins** represented the culmination of [entity:7763296|Qotal's] scholarly research—the location he had traveled to the frontier specifically to find. The structure's match with Queen Zelinda's lore about guardians trapped in waterfall caverns suggested these ruins held answers to ancient mysteries about dwarven warriors and the curse that supposedly affected their kind.

The current occupation of the ruins—evidenced by tents and fires at the base—introduced both complication and urgency. Unknown parties had claimed or were investigating the site, potentially plundering its secrets or facing its guardians. Whether these occupants were hostile, friendly, or simply other explorers remained to be determined.

The **mountain path with guideposts** leading to the distant cave revealed the likely origin point of [entity:8248706|Genovian's] one-eyed emanations. The birds' response to the mystical melody confirmed [entity:7764101|the Willow Dryad's] information—this [entity:8248711|Espada] had taught songs to forest creatures, and those melodies could establish rapport with her manifestations. The path itself suggested previous traffic or construction, with stone guideposts indicating organized travel rather than purely natural formation.

The dragon ogres demonstrated that draconic influence permeated parts of the highlands. Whether an active dragon presence, ancient dragon bones, or residual draconic magic caused the transformations remained unclear, but the lair's evidence of multiple affected ogres suggested ongoing or repeated exposure. The creatures' resistance to conventional damage and their glowing energy mechanic made them formidable opponents adapted for the harsh highland environment.

The Brine Drake revealed that highland waterways contained threats matching lowland rivers' worst dangers. The creature's ability to walk on water, combined with its frightful presence and devastating breath weapon, made it a terror for anyone crossing rivers or lakes in the region. The GM's note that "Brine Drakes don't exist in standard Pathfinder" and the stat block used was actually for a Brine Dragon suggested these creatures might be more dangerous than typical encounters, emphasizing the highlands' deadly nature.

The psychological "gate closing" sensation the party had experienced when first ascending to the highlands proved accurate. These uplands existed separate from settled frontier lands, a wilderness where ancient ruins, mutated abominations, and draconic threats created an environment fundamentally different from the relative safety of [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing].

## Next Steps

Two urgent quests demand the party's attention, both discovered during this expedition. The **Island Dwarven Ruins** represent [entity:7763296|Qotal's] primary objective—the location his scholarly research indicated would provide answers about the broken hammer mystery. The ruins' current occupation adds time pressure, as unknown parties may be plundering, investigating, or contending with whatever guardians Queen Zelinda described. Accessing the island requires boats or rafts capable of crossing 3-4 miles of open water, though the party's recent discovery that their everair masks don't work underwater complicates potential aquatic emergencies.

The **mountain cave entrance** where [entity:8248706|Genovian's] emanations flew offers another path to understanding the [entity:8248711|Espada's] unusual persistence after the last Breath of the Nexus. [entity:7764101|The Willow Dryad] had mentioned an alternative approach—collecting all three protective lanterns to safely access the [entity:7763299|Enchanted Forest] where an ancient tree ent knows [entity:8248706|Genovian's] exact location and might explain the forest's wrongness. The musical melody provides rapport with emanations, but whether that translates to safety when confronting an [entity:8248711|Espada] directly remains uncertain.

The party returned to [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing] on Orpheus 12th having mapped significant territory and identified crucial locations. Their advancement to fifth level brought enhanced capabilities tested thoroughly by the dragon ogres and Brine Drake. [entity:7763295|Bruldin's] Steel Your Resolve feat proved its worth multiple times, [entity:7763289|Alrik's] upgraded armor will increase his AC by six points, and [entity:7763296|Qotal's] striking hand wraps enable his full acrobatic combat style.

The [entity:8248772|Skaven Investigation] awaits attention back at the settlement—two rat people clans conducting coordinated military raids represent either emerging threat or potential allies. [entity:8244510|The Fleshcrafter] remains somewhere in the highlands after escaping [entity:8051165|Skull Rock], having passed through [entity:8051164|Grogug's checkpoint] just days after the party's dungeon assault. The [entity:8244549|Necarch Network] continues operating soul wells across the region despite their victory.

Most immediately, the party must decide their next expedition target. Will they gather supplies and watercraft to investigate the occupied dwarven ruins, potentially confronting whatever guardians or current occupants await? Or will they ascend the mountain path to the cave where one-eyed birds originate, seeking [entity:8248706|Genovian] directly through the rapport established by mystical melody? Both paths promise answers, but the ruins hold personal significance for [entity:7763296|Qotal's] quest while the mountain cave might explain the [entity:8248711|Espada's] unnatural persistence and the wrongness [entity:7764101|the Willow Dryad] senses throughout the forest.

The [entity:8248775|Highland Uplands] have revealed their secrets gradually—ancient ruins, draconic corruption, mysterious paths to caves where supernatural entities dwell. Each discovery raises new questions while providing pieces of larger puzzles spanning dwarven history, elemental beings tied to ley line cycles, and the frontier's hidden supernatural infrastructure. The party stands poised between multiple crucial investigations, their week-long expedition having mapped the questions even as it discovered the locations where answers might finally be found.
