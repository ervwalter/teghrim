# Vampire Property and Bridge Politics

## Session Overview

The reunited party settled into Teghrim's Crossing routines, building relationships with local contacts during downtime before undertaking a critical mansion-clearing assignment. What began as simple property maintenance evolved into confronting undead forces and discovering the new owners' vampiric nature.

## Story Developments

Morning found the party gathered in the bridge settlement's humid mess hall, where [entity:7763289|Alrik Grimmelstang] continued adjusting to his freedom after 150 years of petrification. The chef extraordinaire, accompanied by his sprite companion [entity:7764103|Vidia], marveled at how [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing] had sprouted where once only wilderness existed. When [entity:7763294|Aurelia] touched cold iron to prove her non-fey nature, [entity:7763289|Alrik] relaxed slightly, though he maintained his wariness of fairy folk seeking his legendary recipes.

[entity:7763289|Alrik] regaled the group with exaggerated tales of their forest victory: "We slew the beast! We killed the dragon! Returned with the treasure hoard!" His enthusiasm drew the attention of [entity:7764195|Gaz], the hob server who quickly established herself as someone who "knew a guy" for anything. [entity:7764195|The helpful hob] explained the crucial distinction between civilized "hobs" like herself and the evil goblins plaguing trade routes, offering supply delivery missions to two upriver camps when the next caravan arrived.

[entity:7764102|Aelysh] arrived seeking financial help for seeds, mentioning the captain had a proposition. The wood elf also requested discrete assistance procuring elderberries from "Old Willy" - rare alchemical plants that "three flying little shits" had stolen. The party's nature knowledge revealed these legendary berries possessed remarkable alchemical properties.

[entity:7764097|Captain Irka Spritzel] soon summoned them for an urgent assignment. She introduced [entity:7764196|Rosencrantz], a Spanish-looking mechamagician whose [entity:7764199|laboratory] occupied a southern island complete with fishing hut, barracks, and converted tower filled with da Vinci-esque contraptions. The mission proved straightforward yet critical: clear the [entity:7764198|Von Carstein mansion] before its new owners arrived between the 12th and 14th of Astra Orpheus. Built by a previous commander twenty years ago and finished seven to eight years past, the elaborate estate had stood empty since its creator's death two to three years prior.

[entity:7763296|Qotal] privately confided to [entity:7764097|the captain] about his quest, describing a six or seven story dwarven statue clutching a broken weapon from his homeland. [entity:7763295|Bruldin] grew noticeably quiet at this description, suggesting deeper connections to the mystery.

During their two-day rest period, the party pursued personal interests. [entity:7763296|Qotal] spent time playing his lute and deepening his relationship with [entity:7763866|Lyn Chong]. [entity:7763289|Alrik] investigated his petrification duration - approximately 150 years - while learning alchemy from [entity:7764196|Rosencrantz]. [entity:7763294|Aurelia] sought blood tokens, gaining twelve, then networked with [entity:7764195|Gaz] about local goblin communities and their rumors.

[entity:7763290|Arnór] searched for witch covens, his exceptional investigation leading him to the [entity:7764201|Hades shrine] built into the settlement structure. Maintained by the Church of [entity:7763137|Pharasma], the shrine honored Hades as "purveyor of the undead" who shepherded deceased souls. Finding no existing practitioners, [entity:7763290|the Norn] placed witch marks at sunset to signal his presence to potential contacts, then checked on his familiar [entity:7763867|Natvig].

During preparations, [entity:7763290|Arnór] encountered [entity:7764194|Sigrid], a fellow Norn who had fled Solstheim and now worked with caravans and the general store. Their conversation in the Skald language revealed she was [entity:7764100|Grimnar's] niece, and they planned an Old Lughnass festival for September 22nd to maintain their cultural traditions.

The party traveled by boat toward the upstream island mansion, spotting movement as they approached. Waves of skeps - small undead goblin-like creatures - erupted from the grounds while a necromancer on the balcony raised reinforcements from fallen enemies. [entity:7763296|Qotal] attempted an acrobatic climb to reach the balcony threat while the party engaged in desperate ranged combat. [entity:7763289|Alrik's] needle gun magic combined with [entity:7764102|Aelysh's] acrobatic vine whip attacks as [entity:7763290|Arnór] flanked enemy positions.

The prolonged battle tested the party's coordination against seemingly endless undead waves. When the necromancer leader emerged to revive fallen minions, [entity:7763296|Qotal] executed an aggressive leap attack onto the balcony. The combined assault eventually eliminated all threats, leaving the mansion clear for exploration.

Inside the elaborate estate, expensive furnishings and decorations revealed the previous owner's wealth. Secret passages yielded valuable magical loot, but the most significant discovery came from captured documents. The correspondence revealed [entity:7764193|Osanna Von Carstein] as the new owner - a vampire noble from an ancient dynasty on the [entity:7763172|Astoria] continent. The implications of [entity:7764192|Von Carstein vampire house] expansion into frontier territories raised troubling questions about larger political movements.

The party discussed these revelations while securing their considerable loot. The mysterious vampire-controlled continent of [entity:7763172|Astoria], with its ancient civilizations and complex dynasty politics, suddenly seemed much closer to their frontier settlement than comfortable.

## Combat & Challenges

The mansion assault presented waves of skeps and undead reinforcements coordinated by a balcony necromancer. The experimental gridless combat system using physical measurements created dynamic battlefield positioning as the party struggled against seemingly endless enemy waves. Success required coordinated ranged attacks, aggressive positioning to reach the necromancer, and sustained effort to prevent undead from overwhelming their positions.

## Discoveries & Lore

The [entity:7764192|Von Carstein vampire house] represents one of several ancient dynasties from the [entity:7763172|Astoria] continent, where vampire civilizations maintain complex political relationships. Their expansion into frontier properties suggests larger movements beyond their traditional territories.

The party takes advantage of their required two-day rest period to pursue personal interests and build relationships with notable NPCs who can provide unique benefits and quests.

The [entity:7764201|Hades shrine] reveals how frontier settlements adapt traditional religions, with the Church of [entity:7763137|Pharasma] maintaining sites honoring death-related deities. People leave coins hoping Hades will shepherd their deceased loved ones' souls.

The elderberry situation with Old Willy requires investigation, while upcoming caravans offer opportunities for trade and the hobgoblin delivery mission. Individual pursuits continue developing, particularly [entity:7763296|Qotal's] search for the broken blade's conclusion and [entity:7763290|Arnór's] efforts to establish witch contacts in this frontier region.
