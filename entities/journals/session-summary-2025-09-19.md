# Rats, Relationships, and Highland Ruin

## Session Overview

What began as an ordinary morning at [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing] erupted into chaos when coordinated swarms of giant rats attacked the bridge settlement in a sophisticated military-style raid. The party spent several days strengthening crucial relationships with allies before venturing into the [entity:8248773|Highland Uplands] above the waterfall, where they discovered abandoned [entity:7766459|hob] ruins, battled territorial ogres, and successfully communicated with the mysterious one-eyed creature using the melody taught by [entity:7764101|the Willow Dryad].

## Story Developments

[entity:7763296|Qotal] woke on Orpheus 2nd attempting his daily save against the curse from [entity:8051165|Skull Rock]. Rolling natural twenty, he finally shook off the stupefying affliction that had clouded his mind since the dungeon expedition. With his consciousness clear, the [entity:7763230|Slaan] monk met the party at the mess hall for their customary morning meal, joining [entity:7763290|Arnor], [entity:7763294|Aurelia], and [entity:7763289|Alrik] for breakfast. [entity:7764195|Gaz] served tables as usual, while a new face caught attention—**Georgette**, a bardish lady with a lute who provided musical entertainment for the dining crowd.

The standard alarm bell rang first, summoning guards to handle what seemed a routine disturbance. The party continued eating, unconcerned by typical bridge security matters. Five minutes later, however, the "all hands to battle stations" alarm shattered the morning calm—the emergency signal that demanded immediate response from everyone capable of fighting.

**Giant rats** burst into the mess hall through every possible entrance. Rodents of Unusual Size comparable to the creatures from legend surged through doors, crashed through windows, and erupted from gaps in the floorboards in coordinated waves. The party reacted immediately, with [entity:7763289|Alrik] casting **heroism** on [entity:7763296|Qotal] while drawing his weapon. [entity:7763296|Qotal] used his ki-powered movement to close distance with supernatural speed, then unleashed a **flurry of blows** on the nearest blue rat. Both strikes connected as critical hits—twenty-eight and thirty-four to hit, dealing twenty-five and twenty-three damage respectively. The first rat died instantly from forty-eight points of devastation in a single round.

The swarm proved disturbingly organized. Three green rats attacked [entity:7763296|Qotal] and [entity:7764195|Gaz] in flanking positions. Blue rats double-teamed Georgette with tactical precision. Red rats moved to support their allies while maintaining advantageous positioning. Most unsettling were the **observer rats**—normal-sized rodents that appeared at windows and doorways but made no move to attack. They simply sat on windowsills watching the battle unfold, their behavior deeply unnatural for wild creatures.

[entity:7763289|Alrik] performed a **Nature check** on the observers, rolling twenty-seven total. He determined these rats were acting with organization far beyond normal animal intelligence. Something unnatural controlled them, directing the swarm with military coordination. The implication was clear—this wasn't random vermin infestation but an orchestrated operation.

The combat intensified as rats revealed their true purpose. Multiple creatures emerged from the back rooms carrying stolen goods—dragging sacks, lugging cheese chunks, hauling supplies in organized theft. [entity:7763294|Aurelia] engaged with her rapier after dropping her bow, delivering killing strikes with surgical precision enhanced by her rogue training's sneak attack capabilities—now increased to 2d6 at the party's new fifth level. [entity:7763290|Arnor's] **needle darts** proved devastatingly effective, critically hitting a fleeing red rat for twenty-seven damage and pinning the creature to the ground "like it fell into a pile of cactuses."

[entity:7763289|Alrik's] **storm burst** caught multiple rats in its area effect, eliminating one green rat while damaging others. [entity:7763296|Qotal] parkoured over tables to block escape routes, using his acrobatic combat style to control the battlefield. When the observer rats began squeaking signals, the remaining giant rats abandoned their attacks and fled through every available exit. The party managed to kill several, but most of the swarm escaped with stolen supplies.

Stepping outside, [entity:7763296|Qotal] witnessed the true scale of the assault. The entire bridge settlement faced coordinated attack from the eastern side—hundreds of giant rats conducting simultaneous raids across multiple locations. Guards fought desperately to repel the invaders while observer rats maintained command positions from elevated rocks, directing tactical operations with squeaked signals before orchestrating mass withdrawal. The professional military coordination suggested intelligent direction far beyond simple animal cunning.

The cleanup took fifteen to twenty minutes, with the party assisting guards in securing the bridge and assessing damage. The raiders had succeeded in their primary objective—stealing significant quantities of food and supplies in a systematic theft operation. The implications troubled everyone who understood military tactics. This was reconnaissance in force, coordinated supply raid, and demonstration of capability all rolled into one disturbing display.

With immediate danger passed, the party turned to equipment needs. Their advancement to fifth level meant access to better gear, and [entity:7764097|Captain Irka Spritzel] offered payment arrangements for proven friends—twenty-five percent down payment with installments on expensive items. [entity:7763296|Qotal] ordered **hand wraps of mighty punching** with +1 striking rune for one hundred gold, along with a **pendant of the occult** for sixty gold. The hand wraps would affect all his unarmed attacks including kicks with claw damage, perfect for his acrobatic monk style. Delivery was scheduled for Aestra-Lux 02, though **ERCA** would deliver them early during breakfast on Orpheus 4th.

[entity:7763289|Alrik] invested heavily in protection, ordering **half plate armor** for three hundred sixty gold (ready Orpheus 5th) and a **minor sturdy shield** for one hundred gold (ready Orpheus 3rd). The armor upgrade would increase his AC by six points—desperately needed after recent combats where enemies struck him with alarming consistency. He also acquired a **staff of healing** for ninety gold, allowing him to cast spells while holding his shield, and several **lesser everair masks** at five gold each. The breathing masks allowed one hour underwater, motivated by traumatic memories of previous aquatic combat where drowning had been a real threat.

[entity:7763294|Aurelia] enhanced her bow with weapon runes—**potency rune** for thirty-five gold (available immediately) and **striking rune** for sixty-five gold (four days delivery). [entity:7764195|Gaz] arranged free installation through her contacts, waiving the normal fees. Multiple party members ordered everair masks as well, recognizing the campaign's river-focused geography made underwater capability valuable insurance.

The party spent Orpheus 2nd through 4th in focused relationship building, applying the **Dramatis Personae** system to strengthen bonds with key allies. [entity:7763296|Qotal] dedicated time to [entity:7764102|Aelysh], sharing knowledge about medicinal plants from [entity:7763174|Primordia]. His Medicine and Nature check totaled twenty-eight, teaching the wood elf about exotic botanical remedies while learning she could teach animal-related dedication feats. Their second day discussing nature philosophy rolled twenty-three, increasing their relationship to +3. On the third day, [entity:7763296|Qotal] attempted to deepen their friendship to the **Good Friends** tier using Forest Lore. He rolled natural twenty with +3 relationship bonus, achieving the breakthrough. [entity:7763296|Qotal] and [entity:7764102|Aelysh] became the second Good Friends relationship in the campaign.

[entity:7763290|Arnor] focused entirely on [entity:7764193|Osanna Von Carstein], spending time gossiping about recent events including rumors of a new witch cult. His Society check with secret society lore totaled twenty-nine on the first day, learning [entity:7764193|Osanna] could teach **Aklo** language—the tongue of aberrations and dark entities. The second day proved even more successful with Society twenty-nine again, achieving the campaign's first Good Friends relationship. [entity:7763290|Arnor] and [entity:7764193|Osanna] now shared genuine friendship built on mutual interest in occult mysteries and supernatural politics. He also spent a full day training **Bastard Dedication** with ERCA, learning defensive techniques that would grant him Shield Block reaction capability.

[entity:7763294|Aurelia] pursued friendship with [entity:7763693|Sylvia Mournhold] using Acrobatics as their common ground. Initial rolls proved poor, but hero point rerolls brought her final check to twenty-one—just enough for success. The two spent the day practicing acrobatics, formal dance techniques, and discussing their shared appreciation for movement arts. [entity:7763294|Aurelia] successfully befriended the noble daughter from the [entity:7763863|Mournhold family]. She also spent time with [entity:7763866|Lyn Chong], rolling Religion twenty-three and learning his secret—the elderly monk was prone to melancholy when alone, singing and working but falling into depression without social contact.

[entity:7763295|Bruldin] attempted to befriend [entity:7764097|Captain Irka] using Society with dwarven lore specialization. His first roll of nineteen fell short, but hero point reroll brought him exactly to the DC with twenty-four. [entity:7763295|Bruldin] and [entity:7764097|Captain Irka] forged friendship based on shared dwarven culture, unlocking dedication feat training opportunities. [entity:7763289|Alrik] tried befriending [entity:7764097|Irka] through Engineering Lore but rolled only sixteen—enough to learn the captain appreciated crafting discussions but not sufficient for breakthrough.

On Orpheus 3rd morning, [entity:7763866|Lyn Chong] approached the party with grave news. The rat attack patterns matched **Skaven** operations from the [entity:7763168|Jade Kingdoms]—rat people who formed symbiotic communities near civilizations. These opportunistic scavengers infiltrated sewers and conducted nighttime raids, carrying disease and pestilence while sometimes forming unusual religious cults. Most concerning, Skaven always operated in paired clans—one male-led, one female-led. The simultaneous attacks on both the bridge settlement and [entity:7763866|Lyn's] shrine construction site confirmed multiple coordinated clans working in the region.

[entity:7763295|Bruldin] declared firmly: "This threat must be taken care of." The party agreed to investigate when they returned from other pressing matters, adding **Skaven Investigation** to their mystery board. The domesticated rat people presented complex challenges—in the [entity:7763168|Jade Kingdoms], Skaven had successfully integrated into society through waste management and sewer maintenance. Attacking them might eliminate potential allies who handled unpleasant but necessary services. Yet their raids and disease-carrying nature posed genuine threats to frontier settlements.

On Orpheus 5th morning, strange events marked their departure. Guards repeatedly shooed ravens from the mess hall building, but one persistent bird kept returning to peck at the same spot. [entity:7763290|Natvig], [entity:7763290|Arnor's] trash griffin familiar, investigated the area where the raven focused its attention. The marks proved to be druidic runes from the **Celtic branch** of drune magic—not [entity:7763290|Arnor's] tradition. The implication troubled those familiar with magical politics: Celtic druids were watching the party and sending messages through their corvid servants.

The party set out for the [entity:8248773|Highland Uplands] carrying **Mendel's pastries** purchased from [entity:7764195|Gaz] for two gold with friendship discount. The premium baked goods would serve as toll payment for **Grogug**, the troll who guarded the waterfall path. They found the massive creature at his checkpoint, immediately noticing his missing arm. The troll explained matter-of-factly that several days prior—around Aestra-Orpheus 30th or 31st, just after the party cleared [entity:8051165|Skull Rock]—a tall creepy woman had passed through. She had no visible eyes, wore weird horns, and refused to pay toll. When Grogug demanded payment, she sliced off his arm with contemptuous ease.

The description matched [entity:8244510|the Fleshcrafter] perfectly—the necromancer who had escaped their dungeon assault. Grogug had eaten his own severed arm afterward ("can't let a good arm go to waste") and expected regeneration in one to two months. He offered the party free passage if they brought back the Fleshcrafter's arm, though the pastries covered round-trip toll for the immediate journey. The troll's casual attitude toward losing a limb demonstrated the resilient pragmatism that let his kind survive as frontier toll keepers.

The climb through the waterfall series proved spectacular. Crude but troll-sized paths wound up multiple cascades with mountains pressing close on both sides. From the top, a breathtaking vista revealed [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing] far below like tiny ants, with [entity:7764193|Osanna's] mansion visible on its island and the river stretching beyond into distant territories. But when the party emerged from the ravine onto the highland plateau, the world behind them seemed to close like a gate. Looking back created an oppressive sensation—the familiar valley and settled lands vanished from perception, replaced by psychological boundary between civilization and true wilderness.

The river split into two branches before them. One flowed toward a distant lake. The other hugged the mountains, running between peaks into unexplored territory. The party followed the highland terrain until they discovered ruins—ancient buildings showing evidence of past habitation. [entity:7763296|Qotal] performed Engineering Lore check and rolled natural twenty for twenty-five total, critically succeeding. He identified the structures as old [entity:7766459|hob] construction from approximately fifty years ago, when domesticated goblins lived in these uplands before the bridge was built and they migrated down to the lowlands. Even then, this hadn't been their original homeland—merely a waypoint in longer migration patterns.

A crude burial ground nearby showed typical [entity:7766459|hob] maintenance—poor foresight in securing graves against disturbance, with signs of either natural degradation or deliberate grave robbery. Among the disturbed sites, [entity:7763294|Aurelia's] Nature check of twenty-five identified a magical item—an **Animal Staff** carved with raven imagery. The level three staff granted +2 circumstance bonus to Nature checks for identifying animals and could cast **Know the Way** cantrip, **Runic Body**, or **Summon Animal**. Too narrow and fragile for melee combat, it held ninety gold resale value but limited utility for the party's combat-focused members.

The party camped overnight in the highlands, hiding their campfire after hearing tribal drumming echo through the darkness. [entity:7763289|Alrik's] Society check of twenty-four, supported by [entity:7763290|Arnor] at twenty-six and [entity:7763294|Aurelia] at twenty-one, identified the rhythm as **ogre drums**—distinctly different from the orc drumming they'd experienced at the moot gathering. The party extinguished their fire and spent an anxious night hearing crashes and movement through the woods as something large blundered through the forest.

Morning brought the drumming to silence but not the crashing sounds. [entity:7763296|Qotal's] Perception of eighteen caught approaching footsteps first. Three ogres emerged from the trees: one wielding sword and javelin, one with a great axe, and a female leader variant carrying staff and axe. These highland ogres proved territorial and aggressive, attacking without negotiation.

## Combat & Challenges

The ogre battle tested the party's coordination against powerful opponents with devastating reach and damage potential. [entity:7763289|Alrik] opened with **spiritual armor** for protection and manifested his **spiritual weapon** as a bastard sword, attacking the sword-wielding ogre for thirteen spirit damage. The creature responded by hurling its javelin at [entity:7763296|Qotal] before closing to melee range.

[entity:7763294|Aurelia] demonstrated the lethality of her upgraded capabilities, flanking the sword ogre and striking for twenty-five to hit. Her rapier delivered twenty-one piercing damage—her sneak attack now dealt 2d6 precision damage at fifth level, significantly increasing her damage output when positioned properly. The sword ogre suffered devastating wounds but remained standing.

The **Ogre Lady** proved most dangerous, slamming her staff into the ground before charging. She attempted to bite [entity:7763294|Aurelia] for nine damage, then tried grabbing the dhampir investigator but failed the athletics check. [entity:7763296|Qotal] responded with trip attempt against the sword ogre, rolling Athletics thirty-one versus its Reflex—success. The ogre crashed prone, and [entity:7763296|Qotal's] **flurry of blows** struck it in the face for seven bludgeoning damage.

[entity:7763294|Aurelia's] next attack proved decisive for the sword ogre. Maintaining flanking position, she struck for twenty-six hit and fourteen piercing damage "straight through the kidneys." The ogre screamed in agony and fled from combat, clutching its ruined organs as it staggered away from the battle. The brutal kidney strike removed one threat from the field entirely.

[entity:7763295|Bruldin] entered the fray with devastating effect. His attack on the Ogre Lady rolled twenty-eight—critical hit. Twenty-nine slashing damage nearly split the female ogre in half, bloodying her severely. [entity:7763294|Aurelia] capitalized on the opening, five-foot stepping and attacking with thirty-two to hit—another critical. Her **deadly d8** trait activated, dealing eighteen doubled damage plus six from the deadly die for twenty-four total piercing damage. The Ogre Lady collapsed, dead before hitting the ground.

[entity:7763294|Aurelia] had personally delivered killing blows to all three ogres—earning herself the title "Ogre Killer" from her companions. The players joked about her growing reputation: "Aurelia, the Vampire Ogre Killer," referencing both her dhampir heritage and her tendency to execute the largest opponents. The remaining axe ogre fell to concentrated attacks from [entity:7763290|Arnor's] critical **needle darts** (twenty-two piercing plus three persistent bleed), [entity:7763296|Qotal's] flanking strikes for nineteen total damage, and [entity:7763289|Alrik's] spiritual weapon.

The victory came with moderate wounds—[entity:7763296|Qotal] had taken twenty-five damage total from the Ogre Lady's sixteen slashing and the axe ogre's nine slashing. But the party stood triumphant, and the ogres' dropped equipment included valuable magical items requiring identification: **alchemist goggles** worth one hundred gold, a **hooked rune** (weapon property rune) worth one hundred forty gold, **soothing powder** (lesser) worth thirty gold, and **mistform elixir** (lesser) worth thirteen gold. The GM admitted this was extra loot compensating for forgotten rewards from the previous session, plus fifteen gold per party member from the encounter itself.

## Discoveries & Lore

As the party caught their breath after the ogre combat, exceptional Perception checks revealed they were being watched. [entity:7763295|Bruldin] rolled natural twenty for thirty total—critical success. [entity:7763294|Aurelia] also rolled natural twenty for thirty-one. Both spotted the **one-eyed bird-like creature** perched in nearby trees, watching their victory with obvious interest.

[entity:7763295|Bruldin] attempted communication first, calling out: "Hello, my friend. I have learned more about you. Why are you here? We thought your main form was gone. We are interested to learn more about you if you would like to communicate at some point. We come in peace, but only for learning and knowledge. I come in peace. I don't speak for my friends." The creature stared with its single massive eye but showed no response to words alone.

Then [entity:7763295|Bruldin] remembered the melody—the mystical tune [entity:7764101|the Willow Dryad] had taught them specifically for communicating with Genovian's emanations. He began performing the song with [entity:7763294|Aurelia's] assistance (she rolled twelve on performance). [entity:7763295|Bruldin's] performance check benefited from hero point reroll, landing on natural twenty—exceptional success.

The one-eyed creature reacted immediately to the music. It began waddling and stomping its feet in rhythm, jigging back and forth in obvious pleasure at hearing the familiar melody. The response confirmed everything [entity:7764101|the Willow Dryad] had told them—this was indeed an emanation of **Genovian**, the [entity:7763230|Espada] who had once lived in these waterfall highlands before the last **Breath of the Nexus**. The musical connection established rapport without need for words.

After watching and dancing to the complete performance, the creature hopped off its perch and took flight, heading southeast following the ravine toward valleys between mountains. The party now had their guide—Genovian's emanation would lead them to wherever the [entity:7763230|Espada] herself resided, or to answers about why her manifestations persisted when she should have departed long ago.

The [entity:8248773|Highland Uplands] themselves revealed geographical mysteries. The psychological "gate closing" effect when ascending from the lowlands suggested either natural boundary between settled and wild territories or magical demarcation protecting or isolating the highlands. The ancient [entity:7766459|hob] settlement demonstrated these uplands had supported permanent habitation before migration patterns drew the domesticated goblins down to the bridge construction. The crude burial practices and disturbed graves hinted at either cultural differences in death customs or practical limitations in securing permanent monuments.

Grogug's encounter with [entity:8244510|the Fleshcrafter] provided crucial timeline information. She had passed through around Aestra-Orpheus 30th-31st, meaning one to two days after escaping the party's assault on [entity:8051165|Skull Rock] (which occurred on Aestra-Orpheus 28th-29th). The necromancer had fled into the highlands rather than returning to civilization or seeking her [entity:8244549|Necarch Network] contacts. Either she possessed a hideout in these wild territories, or she was running from something that made even a powerful necromancer choose isolation over organizational support.

The Celtic druid runes represented another thread in the growing tapestry of watchers. First the one-eyed emanations observing combat, now druids sending raven messengers to mark locations near the party's regular gathering spots. Multiple factions monitored the adventurers' activities, though their purposes remained unclear—surveillance for threats, interest in their supernatural investigations, or preparation for future contact all seemed possible.

The Skaven presence at [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing] suggested either expansion of [entity:7763168|Jade Kingdoms] populations into frontier territories or emergence of local rat people clans independent of eastern populations. The coordinated military operation demonstrated sophistication far beyond simple vermin behavior—professional tactical execution, multi-site simultaneous attacks, systematic theft rather than random destruction, and command structure using observer rats as tactical coordinators. Whether the two clans sought peaceful integration like their [entity:7763168|Jade Kingdoms] counterparts or represented hostile force remained unclear.

## Quest Updates

- **One-Eyed Creature Investigation** - Breakthrough achieved: Successfully communicated with Genovian's emanation using musical performance taught by [entity:7764101|Willow Dryad]. Creature responded with rhythmic dancing before flying southeast toward ravine valleys. Party now has direct guide to [entity:7763230|Espada's] location or answers about her persistence.

- **[entity:8248772|Skaven Investigation]** - New quest added to mystery board: Two rat people clans (one male-led, one female-led) conducting coordinated raids on [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing] and [entity:7763866|Lyn Chong's] shrine. Professional military organization using observer rats as tactical commanders. Unknown whether seeking peaceful integration or representing hostile threat. Investigation postponed until party returns from highland expedition.

- **Fleshcrafter Hunt** - Intelligence gathered: [entity:8244510|The necromancer] passed through Grogug's checkpoint around Aestra-Orpheus 30th-31st, one to two days after escaping [entity:8051165|Skull Rock]. Trail now several days old but confirms she fled into highlands. Grogug offers free passage for bringing back her arm.

- **Relationship Building** - Major successes: [entity:7763290|Arnor] and [entity:7764193|Osanna] became first Good Friends in campaign. [entity:7763296|Qotal] and [entity:7764102|Aelysh] achieved second Good Friends relationship. [entity:7763294|Aurelia] befriended [entity:7763693|Sylvia Mournhold]. [entity:7763295|Bruldin] befriended [entity:7764097|Captain Irka]. Multiple NPCs revealed teaching capabilities and benefits.

- **Equipment Upgrades** - Completed for level five advancement: [entity:7763296|Qotal] ordered hand wraps of striking and occult pendant. [entity:7763289|Alrik] acquired half plate armor (six-point AC increase), minor sturdy shield, staff of healing. [entity:7763294|Aurelia] enhanced bow with potency and striking runes. Multiple party members purchased everair masks for underwater capability.

- **Highland Exploration** - First hex above waterfall mapped: Ancient [entity:7766459|hob] settlement ruins discovered with burial ground. Three ogres defeated. Animal Staff recovered from disturbed grave. River confluence identified splitting toward lake and mountain passages.

## Next Steps

The party stands in the [entity:8248773|Highland Uplands] with clear direction forward—following Genovian's emanation southeast into ravine valleys between mountains. The one-eyed creature's positive response to the mystical melody suggests they can maintain rapport through musical communication, though whether this grants safety or merely prevents immediate hostility remains uncertain. The [entity:7763230|Espada] herself awaits somewhere in the mist-shrouded heights near the positive ley line nexus, and answers about her unusual persistence after the last Breath of the Nexus may finally be within reach.

[entity:8244510|The Fleshcrafter] also lurks somewhere in these highlands, her trail only days old when Grogug encountered her. The necromancer proved formidable even when caught in her lair—facing her on her terms in unknown territory could prove lethal. Yet her presence so close to wherever the party travels creates unavoidable risk of confrontation. Grogug's offer of free passage for her arm provides motivation, and the [entity:8244549|Necarch Network] operations she served remain active across the region despite the party's victory at [entity:8051165|Skull Rock].

The [entity:8248772|Skaven Investigation] awaits the party's return to [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing]. Two coordinated clans of rat people conducting professional military raids represent either emerging threat or potential allies depending on their intentions. [entity:7763866|Lyn Chong's] knowledge of [entity:7763168|Jade Kingdoms] integration models suggests peaceful coexistence might be possible, but the systematic theft operations and disease-carrying nature of Skaven populations create legitimate concerns for frontier settlement safety.

The mysterious Celtic druid runes marked near [entity:7763290|Arnor's] previous magical workings hint at another faction watching the party's activities. Whether these druids represent allies, rivals, or neutral observers monitoring supernatural disturbances remains unknown. The raven messenger's persistence in pecking the exact location of old druidic marks suggests deliberate communication attempt rather than coincidental corvid behavior.

The party's advancement to fifth level brings significant capability increases—[entity:7763294|Aurelia's] 2d6 sneak attack proved devastating against the ogres, [entity:7763289|Alrik's] improved AC from armor upgrades will reduce incoming damage considerably, and [entity:7763296|Qotal's] striking hand wraps enable his full acrobatic kick-based combat style. The deepening relationships with Dramatis Personae provide access to teaching, benefits, and eventually secrets—[entity:7764193|Osanna] possesses two secrets (more than anyone), suggesting particularly valuable revelations for those who earn her trust.

Most immediately, they must decide whether to continue following Genovian's emanation deeper into unknown highlands, return to [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing] to address the Skaven threat, or attempt to track [entity:8244510|the Fleshcrafter] through territories where she holds advantages. The equipment ordered back at the bridge won't arrive for days—some items ready Orpheus 3rd and 5th, others not until Aestra-Lux 02—meaning extended expedition requires operating with current capabilities. The party deliberately avoided returning to avoid wagon storage fees, planning to conduct extended exploration before resupplying.

The [entity:7764101|Willow Dryad's] other guardian trials remain incomplete—the Wasps' Queen and Vine Tender must still be faced to collect the remaining two protective lanterns needed for safe passage through the [entity:7763299|Enchanted Forest]. The ancient tree ent who knows Genovian's exact location and might explain the forest's wrongness awaits in those dangerous woods, accessible only with all three blessings. Two paths converge on the same mystery: follow emanations directly to uncertain confrontation, or gather full protection before seeking the ent's ancient wisdom. The melody gives control, the lanterns promise survival, but neither guarantees understanding or safety when facing an [entity:7763230|Espada] whose very persistence defies natural law.
