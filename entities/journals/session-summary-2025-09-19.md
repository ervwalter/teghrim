# Rats, Relationships, and Highland Ruin

## Session Overview

What began as an ordinary morning at [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing] erupted into chaos when coordinated swarms of giant rats attacked the bridge settlement in a sophisticated military-style raid. The party spent several days strengthening crucial relationships with allies before venturing into the [entity:8248773|Highland Uplands] above the waterfall, where they discovered abandoned [entity:7766459|hob] ruins, battled territorial ogres, and successfully communicated with the mysterious one-eyed creature using the melody taught by [entity:7764101|the Willow Dryad].

## Story Developments

[entity:7763296|Qotal] finally shook off the stupefying curse from [entity:8051165|Skull Rock] on the morning of Orpheus 2nd. The party gathered at the mess hall for breakfast, where [entity:7764195|Gaz] served alongside **Georgette**, a bard providing musical entertainment for the diners.

The routine alarm bell drew guards to what seemed a minor disturbance, but moments later the "all hands to battle stations" signal shattered the calm. **Giant rats** burst through every entrance—surging through doors, crashing through windows, erupting from the floorboards in coordinated waves. The party reacted instantly, with [entity:7763296|Qotal's] devastating strikes and [entity:7763294|Aurelia's] precise rapier work cutting through the attackers while [entity:7763290|Arnor's] needle darts pinned fleeing rats mid-escape.

The swarm proved disturbingly organized. Normal-sized **observer rats** perched at windows and doorways, watching but never attacking, their squeaked signals directing the giant rats with military precision. [entity:7763289|Alrik] recognized immediately that something unnatural controlled them—this was no random infestation but an orchestrated operation. The rats systematically looted supplies from back rooms before withdrawing on command, most escaping with stolen goods despite the party's efforts.

Outside, the true scale became apparent. The entire bridge settlement faced simultaneous raids from the east—hundreds of giant rats conducting coordinated strikes across multiple locations while observers maintained command positions. The professional execution suggested intelligence far beyond animal cunning. After helping secure the settlement, the party learned this was reconnaissance, supply raid, and demonstration of capability all in one disturbing display.

The party used [entity:7764097|Captain Irka's] payment arrangements to acquire better gear befitting their fifth level advancement. [entity:7763296|Qotal] ordered **hand wraps of mighty punching** and a **pendant of the occult**, while [entity:7763289|Alrik] invested in **half plate armor** and a **minor sturdy shield** for desperately needed protection. [entity:7763294|Aurelia] enhanced her bow with weapon runes, and multiple party members purchased **lesser everair masks** for underwater breathing—the river-focused geography made such precautions valuable insurance.

Over the following days, the party strengthened relationships with key allies. [entity:7763296|Qotal] spent time with [entity:7764102|Aelysh], sharing knowledge of medicinal plants from [entity:7763174|Primordia] and discussing nature philosophy until they achieved genuine friendship. [entity:7763290|Arnor] and [entity:7764193|Osanna Von Carstein] bonded over gossip and occult mysteries, becoming the campaign's first Good Friends while he learned she could teach **Aklo**, the tongue of aberrations and dark entities. He also trained defensive techniques with **ERCA**, learning Shield Block capabilities.

[entity:7763294|Aurelia] befriended [entity:7763693|Sylvia Mournhold] through shared appreciation for acrobatics and dance, while time with [entity:7763866|Lyn Chong] revealed the elderly monk's secret melancholy when left alone. [entity:7763295|Bruldin] forged friendship with [entity:7764097|Captain Irka] based on shared dwarven culture, unlocking training opportunities.

On Orpheus 3rd morning, [entity:7763866|Lyn Chong] identified the attackers as **Skaven**—rat people from the [entity:7763168|Jade Kingdoms] who formed symbiotic communities near civilizations. These opportunistic scavengers conducted organized raids while carrying disease and pestilence. Most concerning, Skaven always operated in paired clans, and simultaneous attacks on both the bridge and [entity:7763866|Lyn's] shrine confirmed multiple coordinated groups in the region. The party added investigation to their list, recognizing the complex challenge—in the [entity:7763168|Jade Kingdoms], Skaven integrated peacefully through waste management, but their raids posed genuine threats to frontier settlements.

On Orpheus 5th morning, a persistent raven kept pecking at the mess hall despite guards shooing it away. [entity:7763290|Arnor's] familiar investigated, discovering druidic runes from the **Celtic branch** of magic—not [entity:7763290|Arnor's] tradition. Celtic druids were watching the party and sending messages through their corvid servants.

The party set out for the [entity:8248773|Highland Uplands] with pastries for **Grogug**, the troll toll keeper. They found him missing an arm—sliced off days earlier by a tall woman with no visible eyes and strange horns who refused to pay. The description matched [entity:8244510|the Fleshcrafter] perfectly, confirming the necromancer had fled into the highlands after escaping their dungeon assault. Grogug offered free passage for bringing back her arm, though the pastries covered their immediate journey.

The climb through cascading waterfalls revealed breathtaking vistas before the party emerged onto the highland plateau. Looking back created an oppressive sensation—the familiar valley vanished from perception, replaced by a psychological boundary between civilization and true wilderness.

The river split before them, one branch flowing toward a distant lake, the other hugging the mountains into unexplored territory. Following the highland terrain, they discovered ancient ruins. [entity:7763296|Qotal] identified the structures as old [entity:7766459|hob] construction from fifty years ago, when domesticated goblins lived in these uplands before migrating to the lowlands after the bridge was built. A crude burial ground showed signs of disturbance, where [entity:7763294|Aurelia] recovered an **Animal Staff** carved with raven imagery from the disturbed graves.

The party camped overnight, hiding their fire after hearing tribal **ogre drums** echo through the darkness. Morning brought three territorial ogres—sword-wielder, axe-bearer, and a female leader—attacking without negotiation.

## Combat & Challenges

The giant rat attack tested the party against coordinated swarms with military precision. Observer rats directed the assault while giant rats systematically looted supplies, forcing the party to fight defensively while protecting civilians and critical resources. The raiders withdrew before complete victory, demonstrating this was reconnaissance rather than all-out assault.

The ogre battle proved brutal. [entity:7763294|Aurelia's] precise strikes drove the sword-wielder from combat with a devastating kidney wound, then her critical rapier thrust finished the female leader. [entity:7763295|Bruldin's] vicious attack bloodied the leader severely, setting up the killing blow. [entity:7763296|Qotal's] trip tactics and [entity:7763290|Arnor's] needle darts controlled the battlefield while [entity:7763289|Alrik's] spiritual weapon provided constant pressure. The party emerged victorious with moderate wounds and valuable loot including **alchemist goggles**, a **hooked rune**, and alchemical items.

## Discoveries & Lore

After the ogre battle, [entity:7763295|Bruldin] and [entity:7763294|Aurelia] spotted the **one-eyed bird-like creature** watching from nearby trees. [entity:7763295|Bruldin] called out in greeting but received no response until he remembered the melody [entity:7764101|the Willow Dryad] had taught them. He performed the mystical tune, and the creature reacted immediately—waddling and stomping in rhythm, jigging to the familiar music. The response confirmed this was an emanation of **Genovian**, the [entity:7763230|Espada] who once lived in these highlands before the last **Breath of the Nexus**. After the performance, the creature took flight southeast toward ravine valleys between mountains, providing the party a guide to answers about her persistence.

The [entity:8248773|Highland Uplands] revealed multiple mysteries. The psychological "gate closing" effect when ascending from the lowlands suggested magical demarcation between settled and wild territories. The ancient [entity:7766459|hob] ruins demonstrated these uplands once supported permanent habitation before migration patterns drew the domesticated goblins to the bridge construction below.

[entity:8244510|The Fleshcrafter] had passed through Grogug's checkpoint days after escaping [entity:8051165|Skull Rock], fleeing into the highlands rather than seeking her [entity:8244549|Necarch Network] contacts. Either she possessed a highland hideout, or something drove even a powerful necromancer to choose isolation.

The Celtic druid runes marked another thread in the growing tapestry of watchers—multiple factions monitoring the party's activities for unclear purposes. The Skaven presence at [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing] demonstrated professional military sophistication with coordinated multi-site attacks, systematic theft operations, and command structure using observer rats. Whether they sought peaceful integration like their [entity:7763168|Jade Kingdoms] counterparts or represented hostile expansion remained unclear.

## Next Steps

The party stands in the [entity:8248773|Highland Uplands] with clear direction—following Genovian's emanation southeast into ravine valleys. The creature's response to the mystical melody suggests they can maintain rapport through music, though whether this grants safety or merely prevents hostility remains uncertain. The [entity:7763230|Espada] herself awaits somewhere in the mist-shrouded heights, and answers about her unusual persistence after the last Breath of the Nexus may finally be within reach.

[entity:8244510|The Fleshcrafter] lurks somewhere in these highlands, her trail only days old. The necromancer proved formidable in her own lair—facing her on her terms in unknown territory could prove lethal. Grogug's offer of free passage for her arm provides motivation, though the [entity:8244549|Necarch Network] she served remains active despite the party's victory at [entity:8051165|Skull Rock].

The [entity:8248772|Skaven Investigation] awaits the party's return to [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing]. Two coordinated clans conducting professional military raids represent either emerging threat or potential allies. The Celtic druid runes marked near the settlement hint at another faction watching the party's activities, their purposes unknown.

The [entity:7764101|Willow Dryad's] other guardian trials remain incomplete—the Wasps' Queen and Vine Tender must still be faced to collect protective lanterns needed for safe passage through the [entity:7763299|Enchanted Forest]. Two paths converge on the same mystery: follow emanations directly to uncertain confrontation, or gather full protection before seeking the ancient tree ent's wisdom. The melody gives control, the lanterns promise survival, but neither guarantees safety when facing an [entity:7763230|Espada] whose very persistence defies natural law.
