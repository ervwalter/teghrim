# The Orc Moot

## Session Overview

Recovering from their harrowing expedition into [entity:8051165|Skull Rock], the party identified magical treasures, investigated mysterious smoke signals near the old farmstead, and earned an unprecedented invitation to an orc tribal gathering. Through gladiatorial combat and cultural exchange, they gained vital intelligence about the region's true threats—including the revelation that [entity:7763296|Vilis Gavrik] leads a lich network operating soul wells across the frontier.

## Story Developments

While the party delved into [entity:8051165|Skull Rock], [entity:7763294|Aurelia] remained at [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing], strengthening bonds with [entity:7764195|Gaz] and [entity:7763693|Sylvia Mournhold] through shared stories and dance practice. She also maintained contact with her mysterious benefactor Sarah.

The dungeon expedition team returned on Aestra-Orpheus 30th bearing arcane tomes and magical items from [entity:8244510|the Fleshcrafter's] lair, but suffering from the **Curse of Skull Rock**—a mind-clouding affliction that weakened their abilities. With help from [entity:7763866|Lyn Chong] and [entity:7764102|Aelysh], they recovered by the following morning and identified their salvaged treasures. Among the items: **Arboreal Boots** for enhanced mobility, a **Merciful Rune** from [entity:7888221|the Jailor's] whip explaining why it captured rather than killed, **Infiltrator Thieves' Tools**, a disturbing **Demon Mask** crafted from human flesh, and fine **Elven Absinthe**. [entity:7763290|Arnor] passed documents written in **Necral** to [entity:7763294|Aurelia] for translation—correspondence that might reveal the scope of [entity:8244510|the Fleshcrafter's] necromantic network.

Their planning was interrupted when [entity:7764100|Gierr Bjornson] mentioned smoke and drums near the old farmstead where the party had confronted **Annie**. Investigating, they found the site recovering from its [entity:7763136|Diablo] corruption but heard guttural sounds and drums echoing through the woods. A warning arrow announced their discovery by orc scouts.

The encounter began as potential conflict but transformed when the orcs recognized them from their fight against **Annie's** constructs. [entity:7763295|Bruldin], having learned Orcish, exchanged traditional greetings—elaborate insults that earned immediate respect. The scouts asked if they had come for the **orc moot**, a rare tribal gathering where normally scattered clans met for coordination and cultural exchange. The party's previous combat performance had earned them unprecedented consideration for attendance.

Escorted deeper into the forest, they passed through growing concentrations of warriors—hundreds of orcs and goblins assembled at the traditional meeting ground. A large orc immediately challenged their presence: "What them doing here? Ugly humies not supposed to be here." The crowd took up the chant, demanding proof of worthiness. "Fight, fight, fight!"

[entity:7763295|Bruldin] cited their victories against demons and [entity:7888221|the Jailor] at the farmstead, but the **Orc Rampager** champion dismissed these claims. The drums started—a primal rhythm setting the crowd roaring. The party would face five opponents in gladiatorial combat: one massive Rampager, two orc warriors, and three fire-breathing goblins. The orcs explained the **pizazz** system—once per round, fighters could declare attacks with particular flair, earning audience approval beyond mere victory.

The battle proved brutal but spectacular. [entity:7763289|Alrik] survived devastating early strikes through emergency healing. The fire-breathing goblins' alchemical flames struck multiple party members, while [entity:7763295|Bruldin's] intimidating declarations earned the first pizazz point from the crowd. [entity:7763290|Arnor] cast **electric arc** with theatrical thunder and lightning, channeling dramatic showmanship that drew more approval. [entity:7763294|Aurelia] flanked the Rampager for critical strikes. [entity:7763296|Qotal] arrived mid-battle with spectacular displays—pointing to exactly where he would strike before sending the champion crashing prone, following with devastating attacks that delighted the spectators.

The combined assault brought down the Rampager and eliminated the remaining warriors. The gathered tribes erupted in celebration—the party had earned genuine respect and the coveted invitation to the moot's intelligence council.

## Combat & Challenges

The gladiatorial trial tested the party's ability to showcase skill through theatrical combat. The **pizazz** system rewarded flashy declarations and dramatic performances, making crowd approval as important as victory. [entity:7763295|Bruldin's] intimidating challenges, [entity:7763290|Arnor's] theatrical spellcasting, and [entity:7763296|Qotal's] showboating all contributed to earning orc respect. The fire-breathing goblins and the Rampager's sweeping strikes created genuine danger that made the spectacle authentic rather than mere performance.

## Discoveries & Lore

The council meeting revealed intelligence far more valuable than magical treasure. Honored as proven warriors, the party sat with tribal leaders who shared knowledge few outsiders ever learned.

The most critical revelation concerned [entity:7763296|Vilis Gavrik], whose name appeared in [entity:8244510|the Fleshcrafter's] correspondence. The orcs identified him as a **Necarch**—a lich operating an extensive **soul well network** across the frontier. These cursed sites trapped victims' souls while they still lived, technically transforming them into undead. The process carried profound implications for followers of [entity:7763137|Pharasma] and [entity:7763148|Hades], deities concerned with death's proper cycle. [entity:8051165|Skull Rock] represented just one node in a much larger network spanning multiple sites west of the Rothurst River.

The recovered correspondence mentioned **Goldgrin**—apparently [entity:7763296|Vilis Gavrik's] superior within the Necarch hierarchy—and detailed expansion plans. Most troubling: while the party now understood how soul wells were created, they had discovered no method for destroying them. [entity:8244510|The Fleshcrafter] had escaped, [entity:7763296|Vilis Gavrik] remained at large, and an unknown number of sites continued operating.

The orcs shared additional warnings: dangerous wolf creatures in **Midnight Glade**, someone enslaving [entity:7766459|hobs] like [entity:7764195|Gaz], giant threats in certain territories, and recent arrivals at [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing]—someone named **Ephemeria** alongside **Black Templars** of [entity:7763167|Sanguineous].

The cultural exchange proved valuable beyond intelligence gathering. The orcs viewed Common as "toilet speak"—crude necessity rather than proper language. [entity:7763295|Bruldin's] ability to exchange traditional Orcish greetings and insults had earned respect that combat prowess alone could not convey.

## Quest Updates

- **[entity:8244511|Skull Rock Dungeon Expedition]** - Completed with complications: [entity:7888221|The Jailor] destroyed, but [entity:8244510|the Fleshcrafter] escaped and broader soul well network revealed
- **[entity:8051181|Orc Moot Attendance]** - Earned honored guest status through gladiatorial combat, gathered critical intelligence about [entity:7763296|Vilis Gavrik's] Necarch network
- **Necral Translation** - [entity:7763294|Aurelia] translating correspondence from [entity:8244510|the Fleshcrafter's] quarters (ongoing)
- Magical items from [entity:8051165|Skull Rock] identified and distributed among party members

## Next Steps

The intelligence about [entity:7763296|Vilis Gavrik's] soul well network represents a threat far larger than [entity:7888221|the Jailor]—multiple cursed sites transforming victims into undead, organized lich hierarchy, and no known method for destroying the wells. [entity:7763294|Aurelia's] translation of [entity:8244510|the Fleshcrafter's] correspondence may reveal additional locations and the purpose behind this necromantic infrastructure.

The party's alliance with the orc tribes offers unprecedented access to wilderness intelligence and potential military support. Recent arrivals at [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing]—**Ephemeria** and the **Black Templars**—suggest new complications or allies. Enslaved [entity:7766459|hobs], wolf creatures in **Midnight Glade**, and [entity:7764100|Gierr's] wasp problems all await investigation as the party continues mapping frontier dangers and reporting to [entity:7764097|Captain Irka Spritzel].
