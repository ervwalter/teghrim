# The Orc Moot

## Session Overview

Recovering from their harrowing expedition into [entity:8051165|Skull Rock], the party identified magical treasures, investigated mysterious smoke signals near the old farmstead, and earned an unprecedented invitation to an orc tribal gathering. Through gladiatorial combat and cultural exchange, they gained vital intelligence about the region's true threats—including the revelation that [entity:7763296|Vilis Gavrik] leads a lich network operating soul wells across the frontier.

## Story Developments

While the party delved into [entity:8051165|Skull Rock], [entity:7763294|Aurelia] spent her time at [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing] strengthening relationships with key allies. Her social efforts bore fruit with [entity:7764195|Gaz], the chatty [entity:7766459|hob] server who proved eager to share stories, and culminated in exceptional success with [entity:7763693|Sylvia Mournhold], where a day of acrobatics and formal dance practice deepened their friendship considerably. During her downtime, [entity:7763294|Aurelia] also maintained her network of contacts, sending messages back to her mysterious benefactor Sarah.

The morning of Aestra-Orpheus 30th saw the dungeon expedition team returning to [entity:7763187|the bridge settlement] laden with arcane tomes and magical items from [entity:8244510|the Fleshcrafter's] lair. All save [entity:7763294|Aurelia] bore the **Curse of Skull Rock**, a stupefying affliction that clouded their minds and weakened their spellcasting. The party met over breakfast to compare notes, with [entity:7763294|Aurelia] greeting them with dry humor: "How much did you guys almost die?" [entity:7763289|Alrik's] exhausted response about depleted resolve points spoke volumes about the expedition's intensity.

During their recovery day, the party learned about the settlement's support system for proven adventurers. [entity:7763866|Lyn Chong] offered aid against curses through religious rituals that improved chances of recovery, while [entity:7764102|Aelysh] provided similar assistance for diseases and poisons. [entity:7763290|Arnor] passed several documents written in **Necral** to [entity:7763294|Aurelia] for translation—correspondence recovered from [entity:8244510|the Fleshcrafter's] quarters that might reveal the scope of necromantic operations in the region.

By the following morning, Aestra-Orpheus 31st, most of the party had thrown off the curse's effects. [entity:7763289|Alrik] sought blessing from [entity:7763866|Lyn Chong] and rolled a natural twenty on his recovery, while [entity:7763290|Arnor] succeeded through sheer willpower. With their minds clear, they turned attention to the trove of magical items salvaged from the dungeon.

The identification session revealed treasures both practical and curious. **Arboreal Boots** with leafy patterns granted enhanced acrobatic capability and let the wearer ignore difficult terrain created by plants—clearly valuable to the party's more mobile members. A **Feather Token** carved to resemble a fan would boost sailing vessels but held little immediate use. The grimy **potency rune** went to [entity:7763289|Alrik] to enhance his equipment. Most tellingly, they identified the **Merciful Rune** on [entity:7888221|the Jailor's] whip, explaining why the massive construct had dealt nonlethal damage—it had been designed to capture victims alive for delivery to [entity:8244510|the Fleshcrafter].

Other treasures included **Infiltrator Thieves' Tools** that [entity:7763294|Aurelia] claimed immediately, a disturbing **Demon Mask** crafted from human flesh that granted intimidation bonuses and the power to cast fear, two bottles of fine **Elven Absinthe** that enhanced social graces in moderation, **Diplomat's Charcuterie** that sharpened one's ability to read others and make good impressions, and various alchemical consumables. The party debated distribution, particularly the arboreal boots that would benefit either [entity:7763294|Aurelia] or [entity:7763296|Qotal], both of whom relied heavily on acrobatic maneuvers.

Their morning planning was interrupted when [entity:7764100|Gierr Bjornson] arrived at the mess hall for his usual breakfast. The gruff [entity:7763211|Norn] hunter endured good-natured nagging from his niece [entity:7764194|Sigrid], who insisted he needed to socialize more, bathe regularly, and stop spending all his time in the wilderness with his bees. [entity:7764100|Gierr] mentioned problems with invasive large wasps threatening his hives before turning to more pressing matters—during his wanderings, he had noticed smoke and distant drums near the old farmstead where the party had previously confronted **Annie**, the farmer's daughter who sold her soul to [entity:7763136|Diablo].

The party traveled east to investigate, finding the farmstead itself relatively unchanged. New plants sprouted where they had burned the corrupted wheat field, and the buildings remained intact though forest creatures had begun moving into the abandoned structures. As they explored the surrounding area, they periodically heard drums and guttural sounds echoing through the woods. [entity:7763294|Aurelia's] keen elven hearing detected voices speaking in multiple directions, while [entity:7763295|Bruldin] identified fresh orc and goblin tracks crisscrossing the territory.

A warning shot from an elevated position announced their discovery—an arrow embedded itself in a tree directly in their path, clearly meant as an attention-getter rather than attack. The orc archer dropped from his perch and sounded a horn, summoning more orcs and goblins from the surrounding forest. Speaking in Orcish, the lead warrior gave what [entity:7763295|Bruldin]—who had recently learned the language—recognized as a traditional orcish greeting, which doubled as an elaborate insult. [entity:7763295|Bruldin] responded in kind, earning visible respect from the orcs.

Recognition dawned on both sides. These orcs remembered the party's fight against **Annie** and her straw constructs at the farmstead, where the adventurers had put on such an entertaining show that the watching orcs let them leave unmolested. The orc scout asked directly: "You the humies that fought at the farm? You here to see the orc moot?" [entity:7763295|Bruldin's] knowledge of orc culture identified a **moot** as a periodic gathering where normally scattered tribes came together for coordination and cultural exchange. This represented an extraordinary opportunity—outsiders were almost never permitted at such gatherings, but the party's previous combat performance had earned them consideration.

As the orcs escorted them deeper into the forest, the party drew considerable attention. Orcs who had witnessed their earlier fight showed interest and respect, while others questioned their presence with varying degrees of hostility. Goblins, described as distinctly Tolkienesque with slimy mouths and drooly fangs, eyed the party with expressions that mixed fanboy enthusiasm and predatory hunger in uncomfortable combination. The density of warriors grew as they approached the gathering site—easily hundreds of orcs and goblins assembled in a traditional meeting ground.

A large orc challenged their presence immediately. "What them doing here? Ugly humies not supposed to be here. Dwarf, why dwarf, other guys, un-smelly people, they not welcome. They must go... They must prove themself." The crowd took up the chant, calling for tests and proof, the energy building toward inevitable challenge. "Fight, fight, fight!" echoed through the gathering as warriors encircled the party.

[entity:7763295|Bruldin] met the challenge with defiance, pointing out that the party had already proven themselves against demons and [entity:7888221|the Collector] at the farmstead. The large orc—clearly an **Orc Rampager**, bigger and more aggressive than typical warriors—dismissed these accomplishments as trivial. When [entity:7763295|Bruldin] specifically mentioned defeating the cage-chested monster that turned people into flayed meat, it resonated with some of the smaller orcs and goblins who genuinely feared [entity:7888221|the Jailor]. But the Rampager and his champions remained unimpressed, demanding immediate proof of worthiness.

The drums started suddenly, a primal rhythm that set the crowd roaring. The party faced five opponents: one massive Orc Rampager, two medium-sized orc warriors, and three fire-breathing goblins armed with alchemical flames. Before combat began, the orcs explained the **pizazz** system—once per round, a fighter could declare their attack would be performed with particular flair, then roll a different skill to demonstrate showmanship. Impressive displays earned points with the audience, winning respect beyond mere victory.

The Rampager opened with devastating force, using his signature attack to strike both [entity:7763295|Bruldin] and [entity:7763289|Alrik] in a single sweeping motion. [entity:7763289|Alrik] took a critical hit for thirty-two damage followed by a punch for ten more—forty-two points in the first round alone. He immediately stepped back and performed **battle medicine** on himself with **risky surgery**, accepting initial damage for the chance at greater healing. His natural twenty counted as critical success, restoring twenty-nine hit points and saving him from being driven from the fight immediately.

The fire-breathing goblins proved terrifyingly effective, breathing cones of alchemical fire that struck multiple party members. [entity:7763295|Bruldin] critically failed his reflex save and took fourteen damage from a single breath, while others suffered lesser burns. The party adapted quickly, with [entity:7763295|Bruldin] using **battle medicine** on [entity:7763294|Aurelia] between attacks and following up with an **intimidating strike** that bloodied the Rampager and frightened the massive orc. His declaration—"Take this. All of you, see what I can do? We don't have to fight like this."—combined with solid diplomacy earned the first pizazz point, drawing appreciative roars from the crowd.

[entity:7763290|Arnor] cast **electric arc** with theatrical flair, hamming up the thunder and lightning for the audience. His performance check succeeded, earning another pizazz point as he channeled his inner Thor, over-exaggerating the spell's dramatic elements. [entity:7763294|Aurelia] flanked the Rampager with [entity:7763295|Bruldin] and scored a critical hit for doubled damage, bloodying the champion further and drawing impressed shouts from the spectators.

[entity:7763296|Qotal] made a dramatic entrance partway through the battle, his player arriving late to the session. The [entity:7763230|Slaan] monk performed a spectacular trip attempt with full showboating—pointing to exactly where he would strike in Babe Ruth fashion before executing a critical success that sent the Rampager crashing prone. His **flurry of blows** opened with another critical hit, and though [entity:7763295|Bruldin] ultimately delivered the killing blow, the combined assault of [entity:7763294|Aurelia's] weakening strikes, [entity:7763296|Qotal's] devastating crits, and [entity:7763295|Bruldin's] finishing maul work brought down the champion to thunderous approval.

The remaining enemies fell to concentrated attacks, with [entity:7763290|Arnor's] electric magic proving particularly effective against the orcs. When the last opponent dropped, the gathered tribes erupted in celebration. The party had crossed the first threshold—the orcs were genuinely entertained. More importantly, they had earned respect and the coveted invitation to participate in the moot's intelligence council.

## Combat & Challenges

The gladiatorial trial tested the party's ability to perform under pressure while showcasing skill rather than simply surviving. The Orc Rampagers' signature attack allowed them to strike multiple targets with sweeping blows enhanced by weapon traits, making positioning crucial. [entity:7763289|Alrik's] early critical battle medicine after taking forty-two damage in the opening round proved decisive in maintaining party effectiveness.

The fire-breathing goblins created ongoing pressure with their fifteen-foot cone attacks, forcing constant reflex saves and distributing damage across multiple party members. [entity:7763295|Bruldin's] critical failure on his save—taking fourteen damage from a single breath—demonstrated these seemingly small enemies' significant threat potential.

The pizazz system added tactical complexity, rewarding players who took risks by declaring flashy attacks before knowing if they would hit. [entity:7763295|Bruldin's] successful intimidating strike followed by diplomacy check, [entity:7763290|Arnor's] theatrical electric arc with performance, and [entity:7763296|Qotal's] Babe Ruth-style showboating all contributed to the party's growing reputation with the audience. The crowd's approval mattered as much as combat victory, making this encounter as much social challenge as martial test.

## Discoveries & Lore

The orc council meeting that followed the gladiatorial trial revealed intelligence far more valuable than any magical treasure. Honored as proven warriors, the party sat with tribal leaders who shared knowledge about regional threats and power structures that few outsiders ever learned.

The most critical revelation concerned [entity:7763296|Vilis Gavrik], the figure whose name appeared in [entity:8244510|the Fleshcrafter's] correspondence. The orcs identified him as a **Necarch**—a member of a lich faction operating an extensive **soul well network** across the frontier. These cursed sites trapped the souls of living victims for necromantic power, creating spreading corruption that transformed entire locations into sources of dark magic. The orcs knew of multiple such sites west of the Rothurst River, all under [entity:7763296|Vilis Gavrik's] control. [entity:8051165|Skull Rock] represented just one node in a much larger network.

The soul well mechanics proved deeply disturbing. Victims' souls were drawn from their living bodies, technically transforming them into undead while still breathing. The process carried profound religious implications for followers of [entity:7763137|Pharasma] and [entity:7763148|Hades], deities concerned with the proper cycle of life and death. The correspondence recovered from [entity:8244510|the Fleshcrafter's] quarters mentioned someone named **Goldgrin**—apparently [entity:7763296|Vilis Gavrik's] superior within the Necarch hierarchy—and detailed plans for expanding operations into new territories.

The orcs shared additional intelligence about regional dangers. They spoke of dangerous wolf creatures lurking in **Midnight Glade**, a location the party had not yet explored. Someone was enslaving [entity:7766459|hobs]—domesticated goblins like [entity:7764195|Gaz]—for unknown purposes. Giant threats moved through certain territories, requiring careful navigation. The gathering also revealed recent arrivals at [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing]: someone named **Ephemeria** had arrived alongside **Black Templars**, followers of [entity:7763167|Sanguineous] distinct from the **Children of Death** who served [entity:7763137|Pharasma].

Perhaps most troubling was the realization that while the party now knew how soul wells were created—the stone tome and correspondence from [entity:8051165|Skull Rock] detailed the process—they had discovered no method for destroying them. [entity:8244510|The Fleshcrafter] had escaped with her knowledge intact, [entity:7763296|Vilis Gavrik] remained at large, and an unknown number of soul well sites continued operating across the region.

The cultural exchange proved valuable beyond mere intelligence. The party learned that speaking an orc's native language, even imperfectly, provided significant diplomatic advantages. The orcs viewed Common as "toilet speak"—a crude necessity nobody actually liked using. [entity:7763295|Bruldin's] ability to exchange proper orcish greetings and insults had smoothed their initial encounter considerably, demonstrating respect for orc culture that mere combat prowess could not convey.

## Next Steps

The party must finish exploring the hex around the old farmstead and report their findings to [entity:7764097|Captain Irka Spritzel] at [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing]. The intelligence about [entity:7763296|Vilis Gavrik's] soul well network represents a threat far larger than [entity:7888221|the Jailor] ever posed—multiple cursed sites across the region, victims being transformed into technical undead, and a lich faction with organized hierarchy and resources. The correspondence [entity:7763294|Aurelia] is translating may reveal locations of additional soul wells, the identity and location of Goldgrin, and the ultimate purpose behind this necromantic infrastructure. [entity:7764100|Gierr's] problem with invasive wasps remains unaddressed, a small concern dwarfed by the revelation of organized lich activity. The mysterious arrivals at [entity:7763187|the bridge settlement]—Ephemeria and the Black Templars—suggest new complications or potential allies. The party's new relationship with the orc tribes offers unprecedented access to wilderness intelligence and potential military support against supernatural threats. Most pressingly, they possess knowledge of how to create soul wells but no understanding of how to destroy them, leaving [entity:7763296|Vilis Gavrik's] network operational despite their victory at [entity:8051165|Skull Rock]. The enslaved [entity:7766459|hobs], wolf creatures in Midnight Glade, and giant threats mentioned by the orcs all represent additional mysteries requiring investigation as the party continues mapping the dangers of the frontier territories.
