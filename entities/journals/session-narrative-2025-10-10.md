# Chapter 17 - Wool and Wings

The morning of Orpheus 13th broke with promise of peace, two days after the party's return from highland wilderness. [entity:7763296|Qotal] walked toward [entity:7764106|Aelysh's Grove] with the expectation of order, perhaps study with the wood elf who'd become his scholarly companion. What he found instead was chaos wearing a fairy-tale mask.

Every belonging scattered. Books strewn across floor and furniture with pages fluttering in breeze through open windows. Samples from carefully organized botanical collection mixing in impossible combinations. Cooking implements tangled with research notes. The disorder spoke not of malice but of celebration's enthusiastic wake.

Three familiar figures perched on various surfaces throughout the ransacked space. [entity:7764098|Silvermist], purple wings catching morning light. [entity:7764099|Fawn], male fairy whose playfulness couldn't quite hide beneath affected seriousness. [entity:7764104|Iridessa], pink and shy but present nonetheless.

"You must explain yourselves," [entity:7763296|Qotal] said with measured patience that concealed rising annoyance. "You have done enormous damage and caused chaos. You must pay recompense in the form of stories of what happened. You must tell stories to earn my forgiveness."

The fairies seized this opportunity with enthusiasm that transformed demand for explanation into license for epic recitation. They began recounting the tale of Glindorflor—a massive fey gathering during the party's week-long absence, celebrating Grig's accidental victory in Gollveinball, a game whose rules changed with each player's whim and interpretation.

[entity:7764104|Iridessa] launched into what she promised was the opening of a fifteen-thousand-stanza epic, explaining with elaborate detail how each scattered item related to specific moments during multi-day celebrations. She began the first stanza. Then the second. The third followed with intricate descriptions of fey protocol and celebration customs that would require hours to complete.

[entity:7763296|Qotal] attempted escape by walking away and closing the door. The fairies followed, continuing their story from positions hovering near his head. He declared them in breach of contract, demanding answers within thirty minutes. They reduced distance to exactly ten feet but maintained their narrative momentum with unchanged enthusiasm.

He retrieved cold iron from his pack with theatrical flourish, placing a small cap on his staff's end. The fairies retreated to precisely measured safe distance, voices continuing the epic tale without pause. He swatted at them playfully, performance rather than genuine threat, but they maintained their boundary while their storytelling persisted.

"You are not welcome in my home," [entity:7763296|Qotal] announced with finality that cut through fey enthusiasm like blade through mist.

The fairies departed—slowly, reluctantly, still reciting verses—as [entity:7764102|Aelysh] arrived to survey the damage. Her expression moved beyond frustration into genuine concern as systematic investigation revealed worse news than simple disorder.

[entity:8269451|Rupert] had disappeared. Her leshy familiar, small fern creature who served as both companion and assistant, was gone. Tools and supplies were scattered rather than simply displaced, suggesting not accidental chaos but purposeful removal. Whether the fey celebration had swept him into events beyond his control, or something else had taken advantage of the distraction, remained unclear.

The grove would require days to restore. But the missing familiar represented loss that transcended simple inconvenience into genuine worry for a companion's welfare.

[entity:7763294|Aurelia] spent the day helping [entity:7764102|Aelysh] clean while the persistent fairies followed at safe distance, continuing their epic tale despite theatrical threats with cold iron rapiers. The work proceeded with professional efficiency, though the fairies' persistent storytelling created constant distraction that tested patience.

[entity:7763295|Bruldin] pursued personal history with intensity that transcended simple curiosity. The Battle of Rothfuss Delta from eighty years past—massive naval engagement involving dwarven forces—had left questions he'd carried through time itself. He sought [entity:7764097|Captain Irka's] assistance in locating information about survivors, or perhaps their remains requiring proper burial.

[entity:7764097|Irka] listened with the careful attention of someone recognizing personal stakes behind historical inquiry. He suggested potential sources—the two Duergar at the crossing might remember or know records. [entity:7764100|Gierr Bjornson], though Norn aged differently enough that eighty years ago remained uncertain territory. Irka promised to keep careful ear for any mention of the battle or its survivors.

Later, [entity:7763295|Bruldin] spent time with [entity:7763693|Sylvia Mournhold], their shared appreciation for the [entity:7763863|Iron Kingdoms'] history creating comfortable common ground. She described how dramatically things had changed during his absence from the world—the Black Templars growing from minor organization to major religious movement, the Holy Synod transforming from simple record-keepers to established faith. The past century and a half had reshaped political and spiritual landscape in ways he was still discovering.

[entity:7763290|Arnor] completed his third day of prayer, the ritual devotion earning him an augury token—small carved piece that would allow one question about weal or woe of planned action. But the gift came with concerning intelligence. His familiar [entity:7763867|Natvig] reported pecking and claw marks on some witch graffiti throughout the settlement. Sigrid warned that Black Templars had shown particular interest in the carvings during their recent visit with the Vanguard caravan.

The witch cult activities were drawing attention from forces that viewed such practices with suspicion at best, hostility at worst. Sigrid promised information about potential recruits and secure locations for rituals—meeting openly in town would be increasingly dangerous as scrutiny intensified.

The second day brought similar patterns. [entity:7763294|Aurelia] and [entity:7763289|Alrik] both spent time with [entity:7763866|Lyn Chong], the elderly monk whose melancholy when alone made social contact important for his wellbeing. [entity:7763289|Alrik] shared stories while [entity:7763294|Aurelia] discussed religious philosophy, both contributing to bonds that transcended simple friendship into genuine care.

[entity:7763295|Bruldin] arranged for a cold iron maul's crafting, the special metal requiring premium payment he'd settle through installments. His plans extended beyond simple weapon acquisition—eventually the shifting rune would allow versatility, and [entity:7763693|Sylvia] apparently knew someone who could transfer runes without standard fees once proper friendship was established.

On Orpheus 15th morning, the party gathered with shared purpose. They purchased Mendel's cake from [entity:7764195|Gaz]—friend discount bringing premium pastry to merely expensive rather than prohibitively costly—and headed southwest toward the waterfall path.

[entity:8051164|Grogug] greeted them with familiar enthusiasm, the troll's regeneration already restoring his severed arm after [entity:8244510|the Fleshcrafter] had claimed it as toll and sustenance. They negotiated future passage in exchange for Brine Drake meat, the troll's business acumen recognizing valuable trade opportunity when armed adventurers offered premium provisions.

At the top of the falls, they faced the practical challenge that had prevented simply hauling boats up switchback paths. They would build watercraft at the highland level, storing it for repeated use rather than attempting impossible logistics.

The work proceeded with practiced coordination. [entity:7763296|Qotal] identified perfect timber using wilderness knowledge that drew on monastery training and scholarly research—trees with proper density and grain, wood that would float reliably while resisting rot. He applied natural expertise to find ideal materials for watercraft construction.

[entity:7763295|Bruldin] hauled logs with dwarven strength enhanced by encouraging commentary that transformed labor into camaraderie. His inspirational pep talks made physical work feel like shared accomplishment rather than grinding effort.

[entity:7763294|Aurelia] rigged knots with precision born from acrobatic training and careful study. Her first attempt proved insufficient, the complexity exceeding her experience, but determination and careful repetition achieved success that would hold against water's pressure and weight's strain.

[entity:7763289|Alrik] designed the structure using engineering principles, then blessed the completed vessel with divine invocation that called protection upon those who would trust their lives to timber and rope. The blessing settled over the raft with warmth that transcended simple prayer into genuine sanctification.

They stored the craft at the highland level, waterproof coverings protecting it from weather while remaining accessible for future expeditions. The investment in time and effort would pay dividends through repeated use, perhaps eventually expanding to multiple vessels with sails and navigation equipment.

The journey to [entity:8248836|Waterfall Lake] required a day and half of careful travel along the river as it carved through highland territories. They camped overnight, then continued toward the discovery that had drawn them back so quickly.

The vista revealed itself with breathtaking scope. Eight miles of water surrounded by mountains on all sides, multiple waterfalls cascading from heights to feed the lake with constant influx. And in the center—the [entity:8248838|island ruins] that matched [entity:7763296|Qotal's] research with precision that eliminated any remaining doubt.

A massive dwarven structure rose from the island, its construction recognizable even at distance to anyone familiar with [entity:7763200|Highland Dwarf] architectural traditions. Multiple levels built to withstand siege and time. A dock extending from the island into water. And most concerning—thin smoke rising from campfires that suggested current occupation by forces unknown.

They launched the raft and began crossing. Halfway across, details emerged through distance's haze. Large, wooly creatures moving on the island. Multiple groups visible across different elevations.

[entity:7763294|Aurelia] activated the feather token fan with theatrical flourish, the magical item unleashing wind that caught the raft like sail. The vessel lurched forward with speed that transformed careful crossing into desperate rush, spray flying as they shot across the water toward rocky shore and wooden dock.

She anchored herself against the wind's force with acrobatic precision, maintaining position while the raft accelerated beyond control. The dock approached at speeds meant for desperate escape rather than careful landing.

They crashed into the platform with splintering impact that somehow left the blessed raft intact despite abuse that should have scattered timber across the shoreline. Bodies stumbled from momentum's force, regaining footing as awareness shifted from navigation to combat.

The creatures had spotted them. Large, wooly beings that moved with intelligence suggesting organized response rather than animal reaction. One massive leader—easily twice the size of his companions—bellowed challenge from elevated position. Others moved with tactical coordination, some advancing while others climbed trees for better vantage.

[entity:7763296|Qotal] recognized them through scholarly memory: grolsch, yeti-ogre hybrids intelligent enough to form camps and communicate. Their wooly pelts and massive bulk suggested devastating physical power, while their organized response demonstrated cunning that transcended simple beast.

The largest threw a boulder from his sling. The projectile missed badly, splashing into water well beyond the dock, but the threat registered immediately. These creatures possessed range and accuracy that would make the exposed dock platform a killing ground.

---

The battle erupted with multiple fronts developing simultaneously. [entity:7763289|Alrik] manifested his spiritual weapon—a bastard sword of force that appeared beside the massive leader with shimmer of divine power. [entity:7763294|Aurelia] focused with investigator's analytical precision, her tactical knowledge revealing critical weakness: fire vulnerability inherited from yeti heritage. She shouted the discovery to her companions as she loosened her bow.

[entity:7763295|Bruldin] activated his marshal stance, combat leadership radiating outward in aura that sharpened his companions' strikes. The battlefield advantage manifested immediately, coordinated assault gaining precision that individual effort couldn't achieve.

[entity:7763290|Arnor] wove magic into support and offense, his needle darts finding targets while spell energy enhanced [entity:7763295|Bruldin's] capabilities. The tactical coordination spoke to practiced teamwork refined through numerous previous encounters.

The grolsch demonstrated their signature technique—power slams that picked up opponents and drove them into ground with bone-crushing force. [entity:7763289|Alrik] found himself seized and hammered into the dock platform, wood splintering under impact that would have killed lesser warriors. He rose with divine resilience enhanced by [entity:7763295|Bruldin's] healing magic, refusing to yield despite punishment that tested his considerable endurance.

They hurled their projectiles with remarkable accuracy. Giant acorns from pouches they carried, reloading with both hands and feet even while perched in trees. The improvised ammunition struck with devastating force despite seeming absurdity of creatures flinging oversized nuts as weapons.

Then the situation escalated beyond simple two-sided combat.

Winged creatures emerged from the ruins' upper levels—humanoid forms with wings that spoke to predatory nature. They wielded bows with professional competence, arrows finding targets from aerial positions that transformed three-dimensional battlefield into nightmare of angles and exposure.

Something shot fire from within the ruins themselves. Whether autonomous defense, trapped entity, or controlled weapon remained unclear, but the flames caught a grolsch with devastating effect. The creature stumbled, singed and panicked by burns that exploited his species' fundamental vulnerability.

One of the winged creatures grappled a burning grolsch, lifting the struggling hybrid into air before releasing at lethal height. The flaming body plummeted, screaming, to crash with sickening impact against stone. The display demonstrated territorial aggression and combat capability that marked these mysterious beings as serious threats rather than simple opportunists.

The party found themselves caught in chaotic three-way battle. Grolsch pressed forward with physical might and ranged projectiles. Winged creatures struck from above with arrows and aerial tactics. Something within the ruins itself seemed to recognize threats and respond with fire. And everywhere the clash of competing territorial claims transformed simple exploration into desperate survival.

[entity:7763296|Qotal] blurred through combat with monastic speed, his staff finding vulnerable points with precision that transcended mere accuracy into art. When fire enhancement touched his strikes—whether from magical support or opportunistic positioning—the damage multiplied dramatically. A grolsch collapsed beneath assault that combined perfect technique with elemental vulnerability.

[entity:7763294|Aurelia] demonstrated surgical precision that had earned her reputation. Her rapier found kidney strike that transformed massive grolsch into fleeing, screaming wreck clutching ruined organs. Her bow work from covered positions created constant pressure on elevated enemies. And her tactical callouts maintained party awareness even as chaos spread across multiple battlefield levels.

[entity:7763295|Bruldin] anchored the frontline with dwarven resilience, his maul delivering crushing blows enhanced by spirit energy. His marshal stance maintained combat advantage even as wounds accumulated, leadership transcending personal suffering into tactical superiority that elevated everyone within his aura's reach.

[entity:7763289|Alrik] divided attention between offensive magic and crucial support, his healing and enhancement spells preventing catastrophic casualties while his spiritual weapon maintained constant pressure on priority targets. The sustained effort taxed his resources, but his tactical awareness prevented desperation from becoming disaster.

[entity:7763290|Arnor] wove magic through battlefield with practiced efficiency, his spells creating advantages and exploiting weaknesses while his needle darts punished exposed enemies. The coordination between direct assault and magical support demonstrated partnership refined through shared experience.

But the battle was far from won. Multiple grolsch remained active across different elevations. The winged creatures maintained aerial superiority, their territorial aggression making them unpredictable threats. Something within the ruins continued shooting fire at targets whose selection criteria remained unclear. And the party's injuries accumulated with each exchange, endurance gradually depleting beneath sustained assault from multiple directions.

The ruins rose behind immediate combat, ancient dwarven construction waiting beyond the immediate violence. Somewhere within those levels lay answers to [entity:7763296|Qotal's] lifelong quest, secrets about the broken hammer and guardian mysteries. But first they had to survive the creatures who'd claimed this place, navigate the three-way battle that showed no signs of quick resolution, and somehow reach the structure itself before their strength failed entirely.

The battle raged across dock and stairs, trees and rocky outcroppings. Arrows fell from above while boulders flew from multiple angles. Fire shot from ruins with devastating accuracy against combustible targets. And through it all the party fought with desperate coordination, knowing that failure here—miles from help across open water—meant death in wilderness where no rescue would arrive in time.
