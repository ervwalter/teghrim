# Chapter 13 - Blood and Brotherhood

Dawn broke over [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing] with the weight of earned exhaustion. The party stumbled from [entity:8051165|Skull Rock's] cursed depths in the small hours, their minds clouded by lingering necromantic corruption—a stupefying affliction that wrapped thoughts in cotton and made even simple spellcasting feel like wading through mud. Only [entity:7763294|Aurelia] had escaped unscathed, having stood guard while her companions descended into necromantic nightmare.

She met them at breakfast with the dry observation that defined her humor. "How much did you guys almost die?"

[entity:7763289|Alrik] responded with exhausted candor. "I've never been so spent."

The words understated the truth. They had faced [entity:7888221|the Jailor], destroyed skeletal armies, driven [entity:8244510|the Fleshcrafter] herself into retreat through secret passages. But the necromancer had escaped with knowledge of their capabilities and whatever victims she had already claimed. Victory tasted incomplete despite tactical success.

The party carried treasures from the dungeon—unidentified magical items that promised utility if they could determine their properties. [entity:7763290|Arnor] passed several documents to [entity:7763294|Aurelia] with quiet urgency, correspondence written in **Necral** that none of them could read. The letters might reveal connections and purposes beyond the immediate horror of [entity:8051165|Skull Rock's] experiments.

"I'll translate them," she assured him, accepting the burden with investigator's clinical precision.

---

The morning of Aestra-Orpheus 31st brought relief measured in clear thoughts and recovered function. [entity:7763289|Alrik] sought blessing from [entity:7763866|Lyn Chong], the elderly monk's religious rituals providing divine favor that shattered the curse completely. His mind cleared as if waking from troubled sleep, sharp once more despite physical exhaustion.

[entity:7763290|Arnor] threw off the affliction through sheer willpower, his connection to spirits providing resilience against malevolent magic. [entity:7763296|Qotal] remained both cursed and poisoned, unconscious from the previous day's ordeal.

They turned attention to the treasures salvaged from necromantic depths. **Arboreal Boots** with leafy patterns caught [entity:7763294|Aurelia's] eye—lightweight construction granting enhanced acrobatic capability and freedom to move through plant-choked terrain without impediment. The **Merciful Rune** from [entity:7888221|the Jailor's] whip explained why the massive construct had only battered them unconscious rather than killing, designed to capture victims alive for delivery to experiments that required conscious subjects.

Most disturbing was the **Demon Mask** crafted from human flesh, its surface stretched and stitched with skill that spoke of practiced hands. The grotesque artistry could strike fear into those who beheld it, but wearing flayed skin felt like accepting corruption even as they fought against it.

"We could sell it," [entity:7763294|Aurelia] suggested, practical as always.

The **Diplomat's Charcuterie** offered more palatable utility—meats and cheeses that sharpened one's ability to read others and make favorable impressions. **Fine Elven Absinthe** in two bottles promised social lubrication if consumed in moderation, though drinking too much would prove progressively debilitating.

[entity:7763289|Alrik] claimed the grimy **potency rune** to enhance his equipment, while [entity:7763294|Aurelia] acquired **Infiltrator Thieves' Tools** with satisfaction that suggested immediate use. The **Feather Token** carved as fan would boost sailing vessels, but held little immediate value for frontier adventurers who traveled by foot and wagon.

Their morning planning was interrupted by [entity:7764100|Gierr Bjornson's] arrival. The gruff [entity:7763211|Norn] hunter endured familiar nagging from his niece [entity:7764194|Sigrid], who insisted he needed to socialize more, bathe regularly, and stop spending all his time in the wilderness with his bees.

"Having problems with invasive large wasps," [entity:7764100|Gierr] muttered, more to his breakfast than to [entity:7764194|Sigrid's] ongoing lecture.

But he brought more pressing concerns than apiculture troubles. During his wanderings, he had noticed smoke and distant drums near the old farmstead where the party had previously confronted Annie—the farmer's daughter who sold her soul to [entity:7763136|Diablo] for power to avenge her murdered family.

"Smoke and drums suggest orc activity," [entity:7764100|Gierr] observed, his wilderness expertise identifying patterns others might miss. "Worth checking out what's going on."

The party traveled east to investigate, finding the farmstead itself relatively unchanged. New plants sprouted where they had burned corrupted wheat, and the buildings remained intact though forest creatures had begun claiming the abandoned structures. As they explored the surrounding area, drums echoed through the woods—not threatening, but rhythmic and deliberate, speaking of gathering rather than war.

[entity:7763294|Aurelia's] keen elven hearing detected voices in multiple directions, conversations in languages she didn't speak floating through forest canopy. [entity:7763295|Bruldin] identified fresh orc and goblin tracks crisscrossing the territory, hunting parties or scouts moving with purpose through claimed lands.

The warning shot came from elevated position—an arrow embedding itself in a tree directly in their path with precision that announced intention rather than aggression. The orc archer dropped from his perch and sounded a horn, summoning more orcs and goblins from surrounding forest with practiced coordination.

[entity:7763295|Bruldin] had recently learned Orcish, his slayer training expanding to include enemy languages for better understanding of those he might face in glorious combat. When the lead orc gave traditional greeting—which doubled as elaborate insult in orc culture—the dwarf responded in kind with proper invective that earned visible respect.

Recognition dawned on both sides. These orcs remembered the party's fight against Annie and her straw constructs, where the adventurers had put on such entertaining show that the watching orcs let them leave unmolested afterward.

"You the humies that fought at the farm?" the lead orc asked directly, his Common functional if not elegant.

"Aye, that's us," [entity:7763295|Bruldin] confirmed. "We kicked some ass."

"We remembers you. So are you here to see the orc moot?"

The phrase triggered [entity:7763295|Bruldin's] recognition—a moot was periodic gathering where scattered tribes came together for coordination and cultural exchange. Such gatherings normally excluded outsiders absolutely, but the party's previous combat performance had earned them consideration as proven warriors rather than mere prey.

"When does the orc moot gonna occur?" [entity:7763295|Bruldin] asked with interest that transcended diplomatic caution.

"Oh, it ongoing... They may be gathering soon. If you come if you wanna watch."

The orc scout's casual invitation carried weight that less experienced adventurers might have missed. This represented extraordinary opportunity—access to tribal intelligence and cultural exchange that few outsiders ever witnessed. The alternative was leaving without understanding what gathered in their frontier territories, ignorance that could prove deadly when these same tribes decided whether to raid or trade.

"Sure. Where's it at?" [entity:7763295|Bruldin] accepted without consulting his companions, his slayer instincts recognizing worthy challenge.

"Come. You, uh, unscented humies come follow us."

[entity:7763295|Bruldin] translated for the party with enthusiasm that suggested he had already committed them to whatever came next. "We're gonna go to orc moot. Find out what's going on in this area. They're all gathered. What better way to find out what's happening than direct to the source... Hopefully they don't eat us."

---

They marched deeper into forest with orc escort, the density of warriors growing as they approached the gathering site. Easily hundreds of orcs and goblins assembled in traditional meeting ground, and the party's presence drew considerable attention. Orcs who had witnessed their earlier fight showed interest and respect, while others questioned their presence with varying degrees of hostility.

The goblins proved particularly unsettling—not domesticated [entity:7766459|hobs] like [entity:7764195|Gaz], but wild specimens with Tolkien-esque characteristics. Slimy mouths drooly and uncouth, they eyed the party with expressions that mixed fanboy enthusiasm and predatory hunger in uncomfortable combination.

A large orc approached their escort with challenge implicit in his bearing. Bigger than typical warriors, this champion radiated barely contained aggression that promised violence as solution to any perceived slight.

"Well, what them doing here? Ugly humies not supposed to be here. Dwarf, why dwarf, other guys, un-smelly people, they not welcome. They must go... They must prove themself."

The crowd took up the chant immediately, calling for tests and proof as warriors encircled the party. "Fight, fight, fight!" echoed through the gathering with building energy that spoke of spectacle anticipated.

"If you stay, you must show you worthy," their original escort explained, apologetic but firm.

[entity:7763295|Bruldin] met the challenge with defiance that bordered on recklessness. "How do we know you're worthy? We've proven our mettle fighting the demon and the farm. What have you done?"

The champion dismissed these accomplishments as trivial. "You fight weak demon, that nothing. Me stronger."

"You're smellier," [entity:7763295|Bruldin] countered with insult that drew appreciative laughter from some orcs.

"Not true. Good smell. Me got musk."

When [entity:7763295|Bruldin] mentioned defeating [entity:7888221|the Collector]—the cage-chested monster that turned people into flayed meat—it resonated with smaller orcs and goblins who genuinely feared the construct. But the champion and his warriors remained unimpressed, their pride requiring demonstration rather than mere claims.

The drums started suddenly, primal rhythm that set the crowd roaring with anticipation. The party faced five opponents: one massive champion, two warriors, and three fire-breathing goblins armed with alchemical flames.

Before combat began, the orcs explained their cultural approach to battle—fighters could declare attacks performed with particular flair, demonstrating prowess through showmanship as much as violence. Impressive displays earned respect with the audience, winning recognition that transcended mere victory.

[entity:7763295|Bruldin] grinned. This was his language—violence transformed into art, combat as communication more eloquent than diplomacy.

---

The champion opened with devastating force, his signature attack striking both [entity:7763295|Bruldin] and [entity:7763289|Alrik] in single sweeping motion. [entity:7763289|Alrik] staggered under the brutal assault—blow after crushing blow that would have killed lesser warriors outright.

The chef stepped back and tended his own wounds with desperate precision, accepting risk for chance at survival. Fortune favored him, and his injuries closed enough to keep him fighting through opening assault that should have ended him.

The fire-breathing goblins proved terrifyingly effective, their alchemical flames washing over multiple party members in waves of heat that seared flesh and tested endurance. [entity:7763295|Bruldin] caught the worst of one blast, accumulated burns adding to punishment from the champion's assault.

But slayers thrived on such pain, transforming suffering into fuel for righteous violence. [entity:7763295|Bruldin] tended [entity:7763294|Aurelia's] wounds between attacks, his combat medic training keeping allies functional through grinding exchange. Then he struck the champion with blow that crashed home with devastating force, the impact staggering the massive warrior while striking fear into him despite his size and reputation.

"Take this," [entity:7763295|Bruldin] declared to the watching crowd. "All of you, see what I can do? We don't have to fight like this."

The spectators roared approval at the combination of devastating violence and theatrical declaration. He spoke their language perfectly.

[entity:7763290|Arnor] cast lightning magic with theatrical flair, hamming up the thunder and lightning for audience benefit. He channeled inner storm god, over-exaggerating the spell's dramatic elements while dealing punishing strikes. The crowd appreciated showmanship that matched effectiveness.

[entity:7763294|Aurelia] positioned herself opposite [entity:7763295|Bruldin], her tactical placement enabling devastating strike that found vulnerable spots. The champion staggered, bloodied by combined assault that demonstrated coordination beyond typical adventurer capabilities.

Then [entity:7763296|Qotal] arrived—conscious at last from his poisoned stupor. The [entity:7763230|Slaan] monk made dramatic entrance with spectacular attack, pointing to exactly where he would strike before executing perfect technique that sent the champion crashing prone.

His staff strikes that followed were brutal, each blow landing with force that seemed impossible. Though [entity:7763295|Bruldin] ultimately delivered the killing blow, the combined assault of [entity:7763294|Aurelia's] weakening strikes, [entity:7763296|Qotal's] devastating attacks, and [entity:7763295|Bruldin's] finishing maul work brought down the champion to thunderous approval.

The remaining enemies fell to concentrated attacks, with [entity:7763290|Arnor's] electric magic proving particularly effective. When the last opponent dropped, the gathered tribes erupted in celebration that transcended simple victory acknowledgment. The party had crossed the first threshold—the orcs were genuinely entertained.

More importantly, they had earned respect and the coveted invitation to participate in the moot's intelligence council.

---

[entity:7888223|Grabnizog], the large orc who led the local tribes, welcomed them to the council meeting with courtesy that felt earned rather than granted. Warriors who had proven themselves through honorable combat deserved to share in knowledge and wisdom that governed tribal territories.

The intelligence revealed proved far more valuable than any magical treasure from [entity:8051165|Skull Rock]. The orcs spoke of dangerous wolf creatures lurking in Midnight Glade, a location the party had not yet explored. Someone was enslaving [entity:7766459|hobs]—domesticated goblins like [entity:7764195|Gaz]—for unknown purposes that troubled even these hardened warriors.

Giant threats moved through certain territories, requiring careful navigation and respect. Recent arrivals at [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing] included someone named Ephemeria alongside Black Templars—followers of [entity:7763167|Sanguineous] distinct from the Children of Death who served [entity:7763137|Pharasma].

But the most critical revelation concerned [entity:7763296|Vilis Gavrik], whose name appeared in [entity:8244510|the Fleshcrafter's] correspondence. The orcs identified him as Necarch—a member of lich faction operating extensive soul well network across the frontier.

The explanation proved deeply disturbing. These cursed sites trapped souls of living victims for necromantic power, creating spreading corruption that transformed entire locations into sources of dark magic. Victims' souls were drawn from their living bodies, technically transforming them into undead while still breathing—violation of natural law that carried profound religious implications for followers of [entity:7763137|Pharasma] and [entity:7763148|Hades].

The orcs knew of multiple such sites west of the Rothurst River, all under [entity:7763296|Vilis Gavrik's] control. [entity:8051165|Skull Rock] represented just one node in much larger network. The correspondence recovered from [entity:8244510|the Fleshcrafter's] quarters mentioned someone named Goldgrin—apparently [entity:7763296|Vilis Gavrik's] superior within the Necarch hierarchy.

The party realized they now possessed knowledge of how soul wells were created—the stone tome from [entity:8051165|Skull Rock] detailed the process with disturbing precision. But they had discovered no method for destroying them. [entity:8244510|The Fleshcrafter] had escaped with her knowledge intact, [entity:7763296|Vilis Gavrik] remained at large, and unknown number of soul well sites continued operating across the region.

The cultural exchange proved valuable beyond mere intelligence gathering. The party learned that speaking an orc's native language, even imperfectly, provided significant diplomatic advantages. The orcs viewed Common as "toilet speak"—crude necessity nobody actually liked using. [entity:7763295|Bruldin's] ability to exchange proper orcish greetings and insults had smoothed their initial encounter considerably, demonstrating respect for orc culture that mere combat prowess could not convey.

As the council concluded, [entity:7888223|Grabnizog] extended invitation for future contact and cooperation. Warriors who fought with honor and respected tribal customs were welcome in territories that normally proved deadly to outsiders. The alliance felt fragile—built on mutual respect rather than formal treaty—but genuine in ways that transcended diplomatic protocol.

---

They departed the orc moot as clouds gathered overhead, [entity:7763289|Alrik's] earlier weather magic finally manifesting. Behind them, the orc tribes dispersed to their scattered territories carrying stories of the "unscented humies" who fought with unexpected prowess.

[entity:7763295|Bruldin] walked with the satisfied stride of a warrior who had proven himself in combat that tested both strength and showmanship. [entity:7763290|Arnor] carried knowledge of supernatural threats that would require scholarly attention—soul wells operating across the frontier, organized lich hierarchies, and necromantic infrastructure far more extensive than they had imagined.

[entity:7763294|Aurelia] clutched the correspondence written in Necral, documents that might reveal the full scope of Necarch operations once she completed her translation. The letters mentioned Goldgrin, [entity:7763296|Vilis Gavrik's] superior, and spoke of networks that stretched beyond their immediate understanding.

[entity:7763289|Alrik] contemplated the religious implications quietly. Soul wells that trapped living souls violated everything [entity:7763137|Pharasma] represented—the natural cycle of death corrupted into fuel for necromantic power. What response might come from those who served death's proper order?

[entity:7763296|Qotal], still recovering from his poisoned ordeal, considered how his scholarly research into ancient mysteries might intersect with the organized necromantic infrastructure they had uncovered. The [entity:7763230|Slaan] monk's knowledge of history and lore might prove crucial in understanding what they faced.

The path back to [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing] stretched before them, and with it decisions that would shape their next moves. [entity:8244510|The Fleshcrafter] remained at large, escaped with knowledge of their capabilities. Multiple soul well sites continued operating west of the Rothurst River. And somewhere in this network of corruption, [entity:7763296|Vilis Gavrik] pursued goals they could only begin to comprehend.

But they had earned something valuable through blood and combat—not just magical treasures or tactical victories, but allies and intelligence. The orcs would remember them as warriors worthy of respect, and that respect might prove as valuable as any weapon when the frontier's true dangers revealed themselves.

Above, the first raindrops began to fall.
