# Chapter 12 - Bones and Broken Things

The necromancer's command echoed through the bone chamber with the weight of ancient authority, her single word in Necral carrying power that transcended mere speech. The skeletal army rose in answer, bones assembling themselves from scattered remains with grinding purpose that spoke of death transformed into servitude. Five warriors took form—four wielding glaives with reach that promised to keep their prey at bay, and one towering specimen whose size suggested it had been formidable even in life.

"Bring them to me," she commanded, gesturing toward the party with languid contempt. "Alive at the least."

Then she turned and retreated through the far door, leaving her risen guardians to collect or destroy these intruders who had breached security through methods she could not fathom. The door closed behind her with finality that promised deeper mysteries beyond, but first they would have to survive the skeletal army grinding forward with patience only the unliving could muster.

[entity:7763290|Arnor] moved first despite his poor initiative roll, his high reflexes compensating for surprise. **Electric arc** crackled between his fingers, targeting the leftmost skeletons with elemental fury. One jerked and shuddered as electricity coursed through ancient bones, while the other's defensive instincts proved sufficient to partially resist. The damage dealt seemed less than expected—these creatures possessed resistance to the very magic he had deployed so effectively against spider-snakes.

[entity:7763289|Alrik] raised his holy symbol, channeling divine power into **divine lance** that struck the nearest skeleton with sanctified force. Seven points of spirit damage shattered through bone that had forgotten life's sanctity, though the undead proved more resilient than expected. He raised his shield with practiced efficiency, settling into defensive stance that acknowledged the reach advantage his opponents wielded.

[entity:7763296|Qotal] spent his focus point for **ki rush**, monastic training channeling chi into supernatural speed. He blurred forward to engage the rightmost flank, staff whirling in **flurry of blows** that would have been devastating had his first strike not critically failed. The second connected with bone-jarring impact that shattered the skeleton completely, ancient remains collapsing into dust that settled across stone with whispered finality.

The surviving skeleton on that flank retaliated, its glaive sweeping through space [entity:7763296|Qotal] had occupied instants before. The monk's **blurry** defensive technique—channeling chi to create illusory afterimages—turned what should have been certain hits into frustrated misses. His **clumsy** condition from rat-borne disease reduced his effectiveness, but monastic discipline compensated through technique where strength might falter.

[entity:7763295|Bruldin] advanced with purpose that transcended tactics, his maul Vierna singing through air to connect with skeleton four in devastating **intimidating strike**. The critical hit dealt thirty-four points of bludgeoning and spirit damage combined, pulverizing the undead warrior into powder so fine it barely qualified as remains. The dwarf's grin carried satisfaction earned through righteous violence—this was what his ancestors had trained generations to perfect.

The remaining skeletons attacked with mechanical precision, their glaives' reach allowing strikes from elevated positions. One landed solid hit against [entity:7763295|Bruldin], five points of slashing damage painting red across scarred flesh. The dwarf barely noticed, his rage transforming pain into fuel for further assault.

[entity:7763290|Arnor's] second **electric arc** proved less effective when one skeleton rolled natural twenty on its defensive effort, the critical success negating damage entirely. The other took reduced damage from its resistance, electricity grounding through bones that no longer conducted life's essential currents.

[entity:7763289|Alrik] targeted the wounded skeleton, his **divine lance** punching through defensive stance to deal eight sanctified points that exceeded the creature's remaining coherence. It collapsed mid-strike, bones clattering to stone in percussion that marked one less threat between them and their objective.

[entity:7763296|Qotal] attempted to maneuver between remaining skeletons for flanking advantage, his movement provoking attack of opportunity that missed by margins measured in illusory displacement. He reached his intended position and struck with staff that dealt nine bludgeoning points—effective but not decisive. His follow-up attacks rolled natural one and natural two in sequence that would have been comedic if the stakes weren't measured in captured victims and necromantic experiments.

The battle settled into grinding attrition. Skeletons wielded their reach weapons with patience that frustrated mortal urgency, while the party's concentrated damage slowly whittled down their numbers. [entity:7763295|Bruldin] absorbed hits that would have felled lesser warriors, his scarred flesh testament to battles survived through sheer endurance. [entity:7763290|Arnor's] persistent **electric arc** chipped away at resistant bones, while [entity:7763289|Alrik's] spirit damage found purchase where conventional weapons might struggle.

When [entity:7763296|Qotal] finally landed his critical hit—staff breaking through the final skeleton's ribcage to crack it cleanly in half—the sudden silence felt oppressive after the clatter of combat. They stood among scattered bones and ancient dust, their breathing heavy in air thick with spiritual wrongness that pressed against them like physical weight.

"Good fighting, friends," [entity:7763295|Bruldin] declared with satisfaction that bordered on joy. "Seems that we've cleared the curse."

[entity:7763290|Arnor's] dry response carried humor edged with exhaustion. "Time to go home and get some drinks. First round's on you."

"Hell yes," the dwarf agreed readily.

[entity:7763296|Qotal's] more practical observation cut through their celebration. "You know, we should probably investigate that lady."

---

The bone chamber offered no sanctuary for proper rest. Little crevices everywhere leaked rats from surrounding passages, their diseased bodies sneaking toward anyone who lowered their guard. Bones shambled periodically as if animated by ambient necromantic energy that saturated stone itself. The spiritually inclined members felt it most acutely—this place radiated wrongness that made sanctified souls itch with instinctive revulsion.

"We should burn it all down," [entity:7763289|Alrik] declared with conviction born from spiritual discomfort. "Purify it in flames."

[entity:7763296|Qotal's] response demonstrated the practical thinking that characterized his scholarly approach. "It's made of stone. It's not burning."

"That's okay," [entity:7763289|Alrik] countered with zealot's certainty. "You just need to get the flames hot enough. Just need more flames."

They settled for ten-minute rest, those not recovering stamina keeping watch against environmental hazards that treated their presence as invitation rather than deterrent. Another sealed stone door marked the chamber—similar to others they had encountered, with no mechanism and faded magic that suggested purpose long since expired. The mysteries this dungeon presented seemed designed to frustrate understanding, each answer revealing two questions in its place.

When they finally approached the far door through which the necromancer had retreated, the atmosphere grew heavier still. Whatever awaited beyond had attracted her protective retreat, and her command to bring them alive suggested experiments that required conscious subjects. The implications settled like lead in their stomachs as they prepared to press deeper into [entity:8051165|Skull Rock's] cursed depths.

---

The long corridor opened into chamber large enough to house creatures of impressive size, and there stood the reason they had descended into this necromantic nightmare. [entity:7888221|The Jailor] filled the space with presence that transcended its already massive form, the empty bone cage in its chest speaking volumes about victims already delivered to whatever fate the necromancer planned.

The construct pointed to the cages lining the walls, then to the party, its meaning clear despite lack of speech. Surrender. Enter the cages. Become the next delivery to the mistress who commanded from deeper chambers.

[entity:7763295|Bruldin] broke the tense silence with question directed at his companions. "We have the confusion items to neutralize the Jailor, right? There are three bombs total?"

Clarification revealed the tactical assets at their disposal—three bombs created by [entity:7764196|Rosencrantz] and [entity:7763866|Lyn Chong] from [entity:7888221|Jailor] ichor, designed to confuse the construct's simple logic. Distribution had placed two with [entity:7763296|Qotal] and one with [entity:7763290|Arnor], their superior dexterity making them ideal for deployment of alchemical weapons.

[entity:7888221|The Jailor] stared at them, gripping its whip in stance that communicated threat through posture alone. If they would not surrender, combat would determine their fate.

The massive construct rolled initiative that exceeded their best efforts by comfortable margin, its simple purpose translating into reflexes unencumbered by doubt or hesitation. It moved forward thirty feet with grinding inevitability, and as it closed distance its rotting aura washed over the party like physical assault. The stench-filled emanation carried corruption that tested fortitude against the urge to empty stomachs already stressed by accumulated horrors.

[entity:7763290|Arnor] attempted deception. "Should we parley?" His natural twenty on the roll would have been impressive against intelligent opponent, but [entity:7888221|the Jailor] possessed intellect measured in single digits. The magnificent lie wasted against target incapable of appreciating its craft.

The construct's first attack launched chunk of its own rotting flesh at [entity:7763289|Alrik], the projectile hitting for twenty points of damage that represented half the chef's total resilience. Fortitude save determined whether additional effects would compound the injury—[entity:7763289|Alrik] rolled natural one, burned hero point in desperation, rolled another natural one in sequence that would have been mathematically fascinating if it weren't happening to him.

The half-rule applied, treating the second natural one as result of ten instead. His final save of twenty-six succeeded despite the dramatic failure of individual rolls, shrugging off secondary effects through sheer bloody-minded determination. The flesh chunk still hurt—gods, did it hurt—but he remained standing and combat-effective despite losing half his hit points to single attack.

[entity:7763295|Bruldin] saved against the rotting aura through dwarven constitution enhanced by ability to hold breath against inhaled threats. His **encouraging words** attempt failed despite good intentions—"My friend, that looked like it really fucking hurt. Hang in there!"—the roll of nineteen insufficient to provide combat bonus. His **inspiring martial stance** succeeded through natural twenty, granting bonuses that would prove crucial in battle to come.

He moved up to [entity:7888221|the Jailor] with confidence that bordered on recklessness. The construct opened its bone cage chest invitingly, gesture that communicated its purpose with grotesque hospitality.

"No, I'm good," [entity:7763295|Bruldin] declined with admirable restraint.

[entity:7763296|Qotal] offered tactical observation that carried humor despite their circumstances. "Maybe attacking him from the inside is a strategy."

"Yeah, it is a strategy," the dwarf agreed readily. "That's a great plan."

[entity:7763289|Alrik] saved poorly against the rotting aura, wounds beginning to fester from the odor's malignant influence. Fortunately, the damage only applied to those who had lost actual hit points rather than stamina—he remained at full health technically, his stamina reserves absorbing the punishment. He debated spell options before choosing to hold his action, waiting for [entity:7763296|Qotal] to deploy the anti-Jailor bomb before committing his turn.

The monk moved with purpose that combined scholarly preparation with combat pragmatism. Grab bomb. Step forward. Throw with precision that came from monastic training in projectile weapons. His attack roll of twenty-nine connected solidly, the alchemical weapon detonating against [entity:7888221|the Jailor's] corrupted flesh with effect that exceeded simple damage.

The construct groaned—first sound it had made beyond grinding movement—as the specialized formula worked its confusing magic. Its fighter stance with whip began to slow, movements losing the mechanical precision that had characterized its attack. The visible effect on combat capability justified the resources [entity:7764196|Rosencrantz] and [entity:7763866|Lyn Chong] had invested in creation.

[entity:7763289|Alrik] released his held action, needle darts flying with cold iron precision to punch through rotting flesh for ten points of piercing damage. The construct's resistance to conventional weapons made every point count, his specialized ammunition proving its worth against target that would have shrugged off lesser attacks.

The battle settled into pattern dictated by [entity:7888221|the Jailor's] slowed state and the party's tactical coordination. [entity:7763290|Arnor] attempted recall knowledge using both occultism and religion, seeking information about saves that might guide spell selection. His dubious knowledge suggested the construct probably possessed durability but lower will defense—information that proved accurate enough to guide tactical decisions.

His **ignition** spell targeting that suspected weakness forced will save that [entity:7888221|the Jailor] passed, halving the persistent fire damage to mere two points. Not impressive individually, but damage that would accumulate with patient application.

[entity:7888221|The Jailor's] second turn began with persistent fire damage chipping away at corrupted flesh. Then it shook like massive dog, spraying offal and filth at everyone within fifteen feet in **offal spray** that threatened devastating area damage to the entire party.

The dice betrayed its intent. Natural one on the attack roll meant complete failure, the noxious projectiles flinging harmlessly past their targets to splatter against walls instead. The single critical failure saved them from two d8 plus eleven damage to everyone hit, plus automatic damage on subsequent turns for anyone who remained within ten feet. [entity:7763290|Arnor's] low hit points would have likely sent him unconscious immediately, potentially cascading into worse disaster.

Fortune smiled, and they pressed their advantage.

[entity:7763295|Bruldin's] **intimidating strike** rolled natural twenty for critical hit that dealt twenty-eight bludgeoning and six spirit damage, the massive impact causing [entity:7888221|the Jailor] to become frightened despite being construct. His follow-up attack connected for additional twenty points, Vierna the maul singing with purpose as it crushed corrupted flesh and ancient bone.

[entity:7763296|Qotal's] **flurry of blows** landed both attacks, twenty-six bludgeoning points driving deep into the cage chest cavity. He used **ki rush** to step left then back to same spot, gaining concealment from the monastic technique before adopting parry stance. His tactical instincts warned of danger despite [entity:7888221|the Jailor's] wounded state.

[entity:7763289|Alrik] stepped forward into [entity:7763295|Bruldin's] aura and attacked with his weapon, rolling minimum damage across all dice for mere three sanctified spirit points. The spirit damage affected the construct despite its undead-construct hybrid nature, though not as effectively as against purely undead targets.

[entity:7763290|Arnor] channeled his "inner gnome" for **force barrage**, twelve points of unresistable damage striking with mathematical certainty. No save, no resistance—pure arcane force that cared nothing for the target's defensive capabilities.

[entity:7888221|The Jailor] retaliated by attacking [entity:7763290|Arnor] with its whip, still slowed from the bomb and frightened from [entity:7763295|Bruldin's] intimidation. The attack rolled twenty-two after penalties, hitting for sixteen points that represented most of the wizard's remaining resilience. The construct took four additional fire damage from persistent burning, then attempted to move back from melee engagement.

[entity:7763296|Qotal's] attack of opportunity rolled twenty-nine—critical hit that dealt twenty-six bludgeoning points and ended [entity:7888221|the Jailor's] movement immediately. The devastating strike disrupted its tactical repositioning, wasting an action that might have changed the battle's trajectory.

[entity:7763295|Bruldin] advanced to block the construct's escape route, landing hits for fifteen and thirteen points across two attacks with his third strike benefiting from flanking and frightened condition. [entity:7763296|Qotal's] final **flurry** dealt combined thirty-one bludgeoning damage, his staff striking directly into the cage chest cavity with force that exceeded structural limits.

The massive construct shuddered. Bones cracked audibly. [entity:7888221|The Jailor] collapsed forward, the momentum pulling [entity:7763296|Qotal's] staff deeper into the wreckage until he had to brace against the corpse to extract his weapon. The cage chest that had held countless victims now held only broken ribs and corrupted flesh rapidly losing whatever animation had sustained it.

Silence descended like blessing after the grinding mechanical horror of [entity:7888221|the Jailor's] presence. They had won—barely, through preparation and favorable dice that had turned the construct's devastating area attack into harmless failure. The relief lasted only until they remembered the necromancer who commanded this creature, who had retreated deeper into [entity:8051165|Skull Rock] while her guardians bought time.

---

Investigation of the jail cells revealed grim truth—every cage stood empty, all prisoners already delivered before their arrival. Keys hung from [entity:7888221|the Jailor's] belt, but nothing remained to liberate. Another sealed stone door marked the chamber, its faded magic offering no answers to growing collection of mysteries.

The narrow hallway beyond led to larger ritual chamber dominated by swirling portal of dark energy. Chains hung around the otherworldly gateway while bookshelves and workbenches lined walls in perimeter that restricted movement. The furniture created five-square inaccessible zone around the room's edges, channeling any combat toward the central portal feature.

[entity:7763295|Bruldin] shuddered as he entered, his sanctified nature reacting to overwhelming evil that saturated the space like physical presence. This room had witnessed horrors that transcended simple violence, experiments that violated natural law through necromantic ambition.

The meat puppets erupted from hiding with coordinated precision that suggested intelligence beyond their grotesque construction. Nine creatures of stitched smooth leather writhed and wriggled, their shiny black eyes fixed on intruders with hunger that spoke of dark purpose. They attacked from all directions—shelves, workbenches, elevated positions that transformed the chamber into three-dimensional battlefield.

[entity:7763289|Alrik] attempted recall knowledge using religion, his roll of twenty-eight revealing... nothing useful. These creatures represented necromantic experimentation beyond conventional undead classification. His **divine lance** missed despite good tactics, the combat starting poorly for exhausted party already depleted from previous encounters.

The meat puppets demonstrated horrifying versatility. Some moved back and launched maggot-infested slime at [entity:7763295|Bruldin], the projectiles dealing poison damage that increased against already-wounded targets. Others double-moved to close distance for melee attacks, their meat cleaver weapons and grasping hands coordinating flanking positions with tactical sophistication.

[entity:7763295|Bruldin] responded with violence that matched their grotesque nature, his maul crushing one completely with twenty bludgeoning points that sent it flying. The creature died mid-flight, its destruction offering grim satisfaction against enemies that represented corruption of flesh and purpose.

[entity:7763296|Qotal's] **noise blast** caught three enemies in area effect requiring fortitude saves. Two failed and took full damage plus deafened condition, while the third saved for half. Eight sonic points proved effective against creatures whose construction involved stitched leather and corrupted flesh.

The meat puppets on elevated positions launched themselves in bouncing attacks that carried them ten feet vertically before descending on targets with combined impact and melee strikes. [entity:7763295|Bruldin] attempted **Stand Still** reaction to interrupt one such attack, his miss allowing the creature to complete its assault for eight points of slashing damage followed by second attack for seven more.

Another bounced behind [entity:7763296|Qotal], establishing flank that allowed coordinated attacks against the monk. Five points from the first hit, nine from the second—his monastic defenses tested by creatures that attacked with mindless efficiency.

The battle extended through eight brutal rounds, each exchange draining resources they couldn't easily replace. The creatures' explosive death effect sprayed maggots on adjacent combatants when destroyed, requiring reflex saves to avoid additional damage from larvae attempting to burrow into wounds. Their vomit attacks at point-blank range threatened continuous poison damage that accumulated faster than healing could address.

[entity:7763296|Qotal] attempted to grapple one for tactical repositioning into the swirling portal, his initial roll failing so badly he burned hero point for reroll. The second attempt rolled even worse—natural two that mocked his investment of precious resource. When he finally succeeded on subsequent attempt, his effort to move while grappling critically failed, leaving him holding squirming creature while unable to execute intended throw.

[entity:7763295|Bruldin's] **risky surgery** technique proved decisive when [entity:7763296|Qotal's] hit points dropped to dangerous levels. The feat dealt seven damage first—the "surgery" part requiring trauma to access deeper injuries—but the successful medicine check became critical success, healing four d8 instead of two. Net result after subtracting surgical damage: sixteen hit points restored, enough to keep the monk combat-effective through the grinding attrition.

[entity:7763290|Arnor's] **electric arc** proved devastatingly effective, the creatures demonstrating vulnerability to electricity that doubled damage on failed saves. When he finally identified the weakness through repeated application, his spell selection shifted to exploit it whenever possible.

[entity:7763289|Alrik's] **noise blast** cantrip caught multiple targets for solid damage, while his newly acquired sword struck for eight slashing points that proved more effective than his sanctified spirit damage. The battle taught harsh lessons about enemy resistances and vulnerabilities, knowledge purchased through trial and error while hit points drained away.

When the final meat puppet fell to combined assault, silence descended like exhaustion made audible. They had survived, but resources stood dangerously depleted. Multiple party members had burned through stamina points, [entity:7763295|Bruldin] had used his last resolve point, and spell slots approached empty.

The swirling portal continued its otherworldly rotation, occasionally launching vomit projectiles at random intervals. Rats and spiders continued sneaking from wall crevices. This chamber offered no sanctuary, only brief respite before pressing deeper into the necromancer's domain.

---

Thirty minutes of desperate rest followed—ten for [entity:7763290|Arnor] to guard while others recovered, ten for [entity:7763289|Alrik] to stand watch, and ten for [entity:7763296|Qotal] to perform treat wounds that critically succeeded for twelve healing to the wizard. They couldn't afford more time despite their depleted state. Every minute delayed gave the necromancer opportunity to prepare, to escape, to complete whatever experiments required captured victims.

The hallway beyond curved before opening into final chamber that lacked the portal feature of the previous room. Steps and elevation changes created tactical complexity, while something at the far end caught their attention—human skin "wings" that resolved into cloaks made from flayed flesh as they approached.

The necromancer stood revealed in full grotesque glory. Large and tall, with no visible eyes and horns covering her head like crown of bone. Her cloak of stitched skins from various creatures—some clearly human-sized—spoke of practices that transcended mere necromancy into artistic statement rendered in victim's flesh. Around her shuffled fleshless corpses of those same victims, their skinned bodies animated as walker and crawler troops that created difficult terrain wherever they shambled.

She sighed when she saw them enter, muttering in unfamiliar language before switching to Common with evident irritation. "I have no idea how you got beyond my gatherer, nor how you got in here. Obviously my work isn't as good as it used to be."

Her reference to [entity:7888221|the Jailor] as her "gatherer" confirmed the relationship they had suspected—the construct served as collector for her experimental subjects, its cage delivering victims to fate worse than clean death.

"Well, consider this your last chance to tell me," she continued, threat implicit in reasonable tone. "I shall very much enjoy vivisecting you to find out how you've become so good at this."

[entity:7763295|Bruldin] demonstrated his wisdom-not-intelligence philosophy through genuine confusion. "Is that supposed to intimidate me? I don't even know the meaning of the word 'vivisect.'"

The party deflected with humor about being "local neighborhood tax assessors" coming to audit her property, jokes about IRS and tariffs buying seconds while they assessed tactical situation. The necromancer possessed no patience for their theatrics.

Her first turn demonstrated the magnitude of their challenge. She reached toward a **soul orb** anchored in the chamber, magical energy transferring between them in visible connection. The pulse of necrotic magic she released affected the entire party, all four members required to make will saves against effect that stupefied on failure.

Results came mixed—one critical success, two failures resulting in stupefied one, and one critical failure causing stupefied two. The indefinite duration meant the mental fog would persist through combat, reducing spell effectiveness when they needed every advantage.

But the pulse revealed crucial intelligence—strange magical connection between necromancer and orb suggested power source that could be disrupted. [entity:7763289|Alrik] observed the pattern with tactical mind honed through unexpected adventures.

[entity:7763290|Arnor] responded with **Lose Time's Arrow**, granting the party pseudo-haste that provided one extra action each—usable only for Step or Stride, but mobility that would prove crucial in battle against troops that created difficult terrain.

[entity:7763295|Bruldin] advanced through enemy squares without provoking attacks, the troops following special rules that made them vulnerable to area effects but dangerous through coordinated mass assault. His revelation—"They're weak to area of effects!"—came from unlikely source of Sailing Lore somehow applying to these creatures. His attacks against the necromancer missed despite reaching her position, but his aggressive advance forced tactical response.

[entity:7763289|Alrik] cast **spirit armament**, summoning spectral weapon in sword form that struck for seven sanctified spirit points. The damage seemed reduced—she possessed resistance to slashing, and her response to sanctification remained unclear. Not the devastating effectiveness they had hoped.

The walker troops shambled forward to surround [entity:7763290|Arnor], their fleshless bodies intact but skinless in grotesque display of the necromancer's methodology. Their **shambling onslaught** required reflex save, the wizard's roll of twenty-three reducing damage to four bludgeoning points from coordinated assault.

Crawler troops moved within range of [entity:7763295|Bruldin], their second action triggering another **shambling onslaught** that dealt four reduced damage when the dwarf's reflex save succeeded. The troops demonstrated their special mechanics—sharing single hit point pool, creating difficult terrain, requiring area damage for maximum efficiency.

[entity:7763296|Qotal] attacked with limited success, his lack of area-effect spells forcing reliance on single-target damage against enemies designed to absorb such attacks through mass durability.

The necromancer's second turn repeated her pattern—reaching to orb, exchanging energies, releasing burst that required fortitude saves from entire party. Nine points of negative energy damage, halved on successful save. The repeated drain wore them down through accumulated damage that healing couldn't fully address between assaults.

[entity:7763290|Arnor] attempted **Concordant Choir** as area-effect spell, his targeting catching multiple creatures in ten-foot burst. The GM's hint about "weird special rules" confirmed suspicion—hitting multiple troops didn't matter, they shared hit point pool. But the natural twenty on fortitude save meant critical success and no effect. Resources expended for nothing.

[entity:7763295|Bruldin's] **intimidating strike** rolled natural eighteen for total thirty—critical hit dealing forty-four bludgeoning and six spirit damage. The troops seemed vulnerable to bludgeoning, taking full damage that crossed threshold eliminating one section. The frightened condition applied despite their undead nature, reducing subsequent attack effectiveness.

The battle devolved into grinding attrition. Troops used **shambling onslaught** repeatedly, their coordinated mass attacks dealing steady damage that accumulated faster than the party could heal. [entity:7763290|Arnor's] **needle darts** chipped away at walker hit points, while [entity:7763295|Bruldin's] massive maul strikes eliminated troop sections when damage crossed thresholds.

[entity:7763289|Alrik] observed the necromancer's pattern with tactical mind focused despite stupefied condition. She drew power from the orb every turn—predictable rhythm that suggested vulnerability if properly exploited. He considered options: move to melee range for arcana check to reverse polarity, ready Dispel Magic to disrupt her power draw, ready Bless spell to reverse the orb's energy from negative to positive.

All options required readying action to time with her power draw, wasting precious actions in combat where every turn counted. But disrupting her power source might prove more valuable than any individual attack.

He chose to ready **Dispel Magic**, positioning himself to cast when she next reached toward the orb. The gamble meant spending two actions on preparation rather than immediate damage, but his tactical instincts suggested the investment would pay dividends.

The troops continued their assault, **shambling onslaught** attacks wearing down defenses through persistent damage. [entity:7763290|Arnor] and [entity:7763295|Bruldin] took steady hits, their reflex saves determining whether they absorbed full assault or reduced damage. [entity:7763296|Qotal's] attacks landed when dice permitted, his bludgeoning damage effective against troops that shared single hit point pool.

Then the necromancer reached for the orb again, magical energy transferring in pattern [entity:7763289|Alrik] had observed and anticipated. He triggered his readied **Dispel Magic**, stupefied condition reducing effectiveness but not preventing the attempt.

The dice betrayed her. Natural twenty on his dispel check—critical success that exceeded her magical defenses despite his reduced mental acuity. The orb's polarity reversed catastrophically, channeling positive energy instead of negative into the necromancer whose entire magical framework expected death energy's familiar corruption.

She shrieked—first sound of genuine distress they had heard from her—and stumbled backward through door they hadn't noticed. The secret passage swallowed her retreating form, door closing with finality that promised her escape rather than merely tactical withdrawal.

The troops, denied their commander's coordination, fought with mechanical persistence but reduced effectiveness. [entity:7763290|Arnor's] **needle darts** struck for effective damage, while [entity:7763295|Bruldin's] maul crushed through remaining walker troops with blow that sent multiple fleshless bodies flying to stick against the wall in billiards display.

[entity:7763289|Alrik's] **spiritual weapon** rolled thirty for critical hit against the final crawler troops, its slashing damage dealing nineteen points that exceeded their remaining resilience. The fleshless undead collapsed mid-shamble, whatever animation sustained them finally failing without the necromancer's commanding will.

---

Silence descended like exhaustion made manifest. Four combat encounters without long rest had pushed them beyond normal endurance, only stamina point system and careful resource management preventing complete collapse. They had destroyed [entity:7888221|the Jailor], eliminated countless undead servants, and forced the necromancer herself into retreat.

But she had escaped. Somewhere beyond that secret door, the Fleshcrafter fled with knowledge of their capabilities and motivation to either prepare better defenses or abandon this lair entirely. The victory felt incomplete despite tactical success.

The secret door revealed stairs leading to upper level chamber—her personal quarters featuring large bed, furniture sized for her considerable height, and alcoves filled with tomes and magic items. Glowing pentagram marked the floor, potentially summoning or teleportation circle that explained her confidence in escape routes.

The entire lair radiated curse energy so powerful they realized they could only safely spend thirty minutes investigating before suffering increasingly severe negative effects. The spiritual wrongness that had pressed against them since entering [entity:8051165|Skull Rock] intensified here, concentrated malevolence that exceeded even the bone chamber's oppressive atmosphere.

They divided the limited time among available investigations—[entity:7763296|Qotal] examining stone tome and flayed corpses, [entity:7763289|Alrik] studying spiritual environment and soul pool properties, [entity:7763290|Arnor] analyzing magic tomes and pentagram circle, [entity:7763295|Bruldin] defending to provide investigation bonuses before examining the trash pile.

The knowledge they gained would prove valuable once assembled and analyzed, but immediate priority remained: leave this cursed place before it drained more than hit points. [entity:7763296|Qotal] collected correspondence written in Necral that none of them could read, documents that might reveal the Fleshcrafter's broader connections and purpose.

Multiple sealed stone doors throughout the complex remained mysterious—faded magic and no apparent opening mechanisms, their purpose unknown despite the party's victory over the dungeon's master. Another mystery added to growing collection.

---

They climbed from [entity:8051165|Skull Rock's] depths exhausted but triumphant, emerging into afternoon rain that felt cleansing after the spiritual corruption below. [entity:7764193|Osanna] lay unconscious where she had fallen, her vampire nature slowly recovering from the positive energy shock that had thrown her from the pedestal.

The cursed stone formation's field had dissipated with deactivation, [entity:7888221|the Jailor] stood destroyed in the depths, and the necromancer had fled through secret passages that might lead anywhere. They had achieved their primary objective—eliminating the immediate threat to [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing] and surrounding territories.

But questions remained. Where had the Fleshcrafter escaped? What did the Necral correspondence contain? What fate had befallen all the victims delivered by [entity:7888221|the Jailor] before their arrival? What purpose served the sealed stone doors with their faded enchantments?

The twelfth chapter of their frontier saga closed with bones defeated and broken things scattered through [entity:8051165|Skull Rock's] abandoned chambers, while ahead lay translation of mysterious documents, reporting to allies at [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing], and decisions about whether to pursue the escaped necromancer or address other threats gathering around their bridge settlement home.

They had proven themselves capable of sustained combat through multiple deadly encounters, tactical coordination that compensated for individual limitations, and stubborn refusal to surrender despite facing horrors that would have broken lesser adventurers. The Fleshcrafter had underestimated them—her "gatherer" destroyed, her lair breached, her experiments interrupted by frontier competence dressed as neighborhood tax assessors.

Above them, clouds lingered as [entity:7763289|Alrik] had predicted, while [entity:7764193|Osanna] stirred toward consciousness that would demand detailed accounts of their discoveries. Behind them, [entity:8051165|Skull Rock] stood silent except for rats and spiders reclaiming chambers their mistress had abandoned.

And somewhere beyond secret passages and hidden routes, the Fleshcrafter plotted either revenge or retreat, her grotesque cloak of flayed skins carried toward unknown destination while heroes she had threatened to vivisect caught their breath and counted their victories measured in survival rather than complete success.

The bones had fallen. The things had broken. But the mysteries remained, and the frontier's supernatural politics grew more complex with each revelation about forces operating beyond civilization's comfortable boundaries.

They had won the battle. The war continued.
