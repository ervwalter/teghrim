# Chapter 12 - Bones and Broken Things

[entity:7763290|Arnor] moved first, lightning crackling between his fingers as he targeted the leftmost skeletons with elemental fury. One jerked and shuddered as electricity coursed through ancient bones, while the other weathered the assault with minimal effect. These creatures seemed resistant to the very magic he had deployed so effectively against spider-snakes.

[entity:7763289|Alrik] raised his holy symbol, channeling divine power that struck the nearest skeleton with sanctified force. Sacred energy shattered through bone that had forgotten life's sanctity, though the undead proved more resilient than expected. He raised his shield with practiced efficiency, settling into defensive stance that acknowledged the reach advantage his opponents wielded.

[entity:7763296|Qotal] channeled his inner energy, monastic training granting supernatural speed. He blurred forward to engage the rightmost flank, staff whirling in rapid strikes. His first attack went wide, but the second connected with bone-jarring impact that shattered the skeleton completely, ancient remains collapsing into dust that settled across stone with whispered finality.

The surviving skeleton on that flank retaliated, its glaive sweeping through space [entity:7763296|Qotal] had occupied instants before. The monk's defensive technique—channeling chi to create illusory afterimages—turned what should have been certain hits into frustrated misses. The lingering effects of rat-borne disease weakened him, but monastic discipline compensated through technique where strength faltered.

[entity:7763295|Bruldin] advanced with purpose that transcended tactics, his maul Vierna singing through air to connect with devastating force. The blow pulverized the undead warrior into powder so fine it barely qualified as remains, the skeleton's form disintegrating under the impact. The dwarf's grin carried satisfaction earned through righteous violence—this was what his ancestors had trained generations to perfect.

The remaining skeletons attacked with mechanical precision, their glaives' reach allowing strikes from elevated positions. One landed a solid hit against [entity:7763295|Bruldin], blade biting into scarred flesh and drawing blood. The dwarf barely noticed, his rage transforming pain into fuel for further assault.

[entity:7763290|Arnor's] second burst of lightning proved less effective, one skeleton somehow weathering the assault entirely while the other's resistance reduced the impact. Electricity grounded through bones that no longer conducted life's essential currents.

[entity:7763289|Alrik] targeted the wounded skeleton, divine power punching through its defensive stance. Sacred energy overwhelmed what remained of the creature's animation, and it collapsed mid-strike, bones clattering to stone in percussion that marked one less threat between them and their objective.

[entity:7763296|Qotal] attempted to maneuver between remaining skeletons for flanking advantage, his movement provoking a retaliatory strike that missed by margins measured in illusory displacement. He reached his intended position and struck with his staff—effective but not decisive. His follow-up attacks went embarrassingly wide in sequence that would have been comedic if the stakes weren't measured in captured victims and necromantic experiments.

The battle settled into grinding attrition. Skeletons wielded their reach weapons with patience that frustrated mortal urgency, while the party's concentrated assault slowly whittled down their numbers. [entity:7763295|Bruldin] absorbed hits that would have felled lesser warriors, his scarred flesh testament to battles survived through sheer endurance. [entity:7763290|Arnor's] persistent lightning chipped away at resistant bones, while [entity:7763289|Alrik's] sanctified power found purchase where conventional weapons might struggle.

When [entity:7763296|Qotal] finally landed a devastating blow—staff breaking through the final skeleton's ribcage to crack it cleanly in half—the sudden silence felt oppressive after the clatter of combat. They stood among scattered bones and ancient dust, their breathing heavy in air thick with spiritual wrongness that pressed against them like physical weight.

"Good fighting, friends," [entity:7763295|Bruldin] declared with satisfaction that bordered on joy. "Seems that we've cleared the curse."

[entity:7763290|Arnor's] dry response carried humor edged with exhaustion. "Time to go home and get some drinks. First round's on you."

"Hell yes," the dwarf agreed readily.

[entity:7763296|Qotal's] more practical observation cut through their celebration. "You know, we should probably investigate that lady."

---

The bone chamber offered no sanctuary for proper rest. Little crevices everywhere leaked rats from surrounding passages, their diseased bodies sneaking toward anyone who lowered their guard. Bones shambled periodically as if animated by ambient necromantic energy that saturated stone itself. The spiritually inclined members felt it most acutely—this place radiated wrongness that made sanctified souls itch with instinctive revulsion.

"We should burn it all down," [entity:7763289|Alrik] declared with conviction born from spiritual discomfort. "Purify it in flames."

[entity:7763296|Qotal's] response demonstrated the practical thinking that characterized his scholarly approach. "It's made of stone. It's not burning."

"That's okay," [entity:7763289|Alrik] countered with zealot's certainty. "You just need to get the flames hot enough. Just need more flames."

They settled for brief rest, those recovering their strength while others kept watch against environmental hazards that treated their presence as invitation rather than deterrent. Another sealed stone door marked the chamber—similar to others they had encountered, with no mechanism and faded magic that suggested purpose long since expired. The mysteries this dungeon presented seemed designed to frustrate understanding, each answer revealing two questions in its place.

When they finally approached the far door through which the necromancer had retreated, the atmosphere grew heavier still. Whatever awaited beyond had attracted her protective retreat, and her command to bring them alive suggested experiments that required conscious subjects. The implications settled like lead in their stomachs as they prepared to press deeper into [entity:8051165|Skull Rock's] cursed depths.

---

The long corridor opened into chamber large enough to house creatures of impressive size, and there stood the reason they had descended into this necromantic nightmare. [entity:7888221|The Jailor] filled the space with presence that transcended its already massive form, the empty bone cage in its chest speaking volumes about victims already delivered to whatever fate the necromancer planned.

The construct pointed to the cages lining the walls, then to the party, its meaning clear despite lack of speech. Surrender. Enter the cages. Become the next delivery to the mistress who commanded from deeper chambers.

[entity:7763295|Bruldin] broke the tense silence with question directed at his companions. "We have the confusion items to neutralize the Jailor, right? There are three bombs total?"

Clarification revealed the tactical assets at their disposal—three bombs created by [entity:7764196|Rosencrantz] and [entity:7763866|Lyn Chong] from [entity:7888221|Jailor] ichor, designed to confuse the construct's simple logic. Distribution had placed two with [entity:7763296|Qotal] and one with [entity:7763290|Arnor], their superior dexterity making them ideal for deployment of alchemical weapons.

[entity:7888221|The Jailor] stared at them, gripping its whip in stance that communicated threat through posture alone. If they would not surrender, combat would determine their fate.

The massive construct moved first, its simple purpose translating into reflexes unencumbered by doubt or hesitation. It advanced with grinding inevitability, and as it closed distance its rotting aura washed over the party like physical assault. The stench-filled emanation carried corruption that threatened to empty stomachs already stressed by accumulated horrors.

[entity:7763290|Arnor] attempted deception. "Should we parley?" His masterful lie would have been impressive against an intelligent opponent, but [entity:7888221|the Jailor] possessed minimal intellect. The magnificent deception wasted against a target incapable of appreciating its craft.

The construct's first attack launched a chunk of its own rotting flesh at [entity:7763289|Alrik], the projectile striking with devastating force. The impact drove the chef backward, blood spraying as corrupted flesh tore through his defenses. He struggled against secondary effects, fortune flickering before finally holding firm through sheer bloody-minded determination. The flesh chunk hurt—gods, did it hurt—but he remained standing and combat-effective despite grievous injury.

[entity:7763295|Bruldin] weathered the rotting aura through dwarven constitution and held breath against the inhaled corruption. He called out encouragement—"My friend, that looked like it really fucking hurt. Hang in there!"—words sincere despite their limited tactical impact. Then he settled into a combat stance that radiated confidence, inspiring his companions through example.

He moved up to [entity:7888221|the Jailor] with boldness that bordered on recklessness. The construct opened its bone cage chest invitingly, a gesture that communicated its purpose with grotesque hospitality.

"No, I'm good," [entity:7763295|Bruldin] declined with admirable restraint.

[entity:7763296|Qotal] offered tactical observation that carried humor despite their circumstances. "Maybe attacking him from the inside is a strategy."

"Yeah, it is a strategy," the dwarf agreed readily. "That's a great plan."

[entity:7763289|Alrik] struggled against the rotting aura, his wounds beginning to fester from the odor's malignant influence. Though his reserves protected him from the worst effects, the spiritual corruption gnawed at his endurance. He debated spell options before choosing to hold his action, waiting for [entity:7763296|Qotal] to deploy the anti-Jailor bomb before committing his turn.

The monk moved with purpose that combined scholarly preparation with combat pragmatism. Grab bomb. Step forward. Throw with precision that came from monastic training in projectile weapons. The alchemical weapon connected solidly, detonating against [entity:7888221|the Jailor's] corrupted flesh with an effect that exceeded simple damage.

The construct groaned—the first sound it had made beyond grinding movement—as the specialized formula worked its confusing magic. Its stance with the whip began to falter, movements losing the mechanical precision that had characterized its attacks. The visible effect on its capability justified the resources [entity:7764196|Rosencrantz] and [entity:7763866|Lyn Chong] had invested in the bombs' creation.

[entity:7763289|Alrik] released his held action, needle darts flying with cold iron precision to punch through rotting flesh. The construct's resistance to conventional weapons made his specialized ammunition crucial, each dart striking true where lesser weapons would have failed.

The battle settled into a pattern dictated by [entity:7888221|the Jailor's] slowed state and the party's tactical coordination. [entity:7763290|Arnor] studied the construct, drawing on occult and religious knowledge to identify weaknesses. His intuition suggested the construct possessed physical durability but weaker mental defenses—information that proved accurate enough to guide his spellwork.

His ignition spell targeted that suspected weakness, flames erupting across corrupted flesh. [entity:7888221|The Jailor] resisted the worst of it, but fire clung stubbornly to rotting meat, continuing to burn and chip away at the construct's form.

[entity:7888221|The Jailor] responded violently, shaking itself like a massive dog and spraying offal and filth at everyone nearby in a devastating area attack.

Fortune intervened. The noxious projectiles flung wide, splattering harmlessly against walls instead of finding their targets. The catastrophic failure saved them from wounds that would have overwhelmed their depleted reserves. [entity:7763290|Arnor's] weakened state meant even a glancing blow might have felled him, potentially cascading into disaster.

They pressed their advantage.

[entity:7763295|Bruldin's] maul struck with terrifying force, the massive impact causing even the mindless construct to recoil. His follow-up attack connected solidly, Vierna singing with purpose as it crushed corrupted flesh and ancient bone.

[entity:7763296|Qotal's] rapid strikes landed with precision, driving deep into the cage chest cavity. He moved with supernatural speed, stepping and returning in a blur before settling into defensive stance. His tactical instincts warned of danger despite [entity:7888221|the Jailor's] wounded state.

[entity:7763289|Alrik] stepped forward and attacked with his weapon, sanctified power flowing through the blade. The spirit damage affected the construct despite its hybrid nature, though not as effectively as against purely undead targets.

[entity:7763290|Arnor] channeled arcane force, magical energy striking with mathematical certainty. Pure power that bypassed resistance, caring nothing for the target's defensive capabilities.

[entity:7888221|The Jailor] retaliated by attacking [entity:7763290|Arnor] with its whip, still slowed from the bomb and reeling from [entity:7763295|Bruldin's] assault. The strike connected, tearing into the wizard's flesh and nearly dropping him. The construct continued burning from persistent flames, then attempted to withdraw from melee engagement.

[entity:7763296|Qotal's] retaliatory strike landed with devastating precision, the blow ending [entity:7888221|the Jailor's] movement immediately. The staff strike disrupted its tactical repositioning, wasting effort that might have changed the battle's trajectory.

[entity:7763295|Bruldin] advanced to block the construct's escape route, landing multiple solid hits with his maul. [entity:7763296|Qotal's] final combination of rapid strikes drove directly into the cage chest cavity with force that exceeded structural limits.

The massive construct shuddered. Bones cracked audibly. [entity:7888221|The Jailor] collapsed forward, the momentum pulling [entity:7763296|Qotal's] staff deeper into the wreckage until he had to brace against the corpse to extract his weapon. The cage chest that had held countless victims now held only broken ribs and corrupted flesh rapidly losing whatever animation had sustained it.

Silence descended like a blessing after the grinding mechanical horror of [entity:7888221|the Jailor's] presence. They had won—barely, through preparation and fortune that had turned the construct's devastating attack into harmless failure. The relief lasted only until they remembered the necromancer who commanded this creature, who had retreated deeper into [entity:8051165|Skull Rock] while her guardians bought time.

---

Investigation of the jail cells revealed grim truth—every cage stood empty, all prisoners already delivered before their arrival. Keys hung from [entity:7888221|the Jailor's] belt, but nothing remained to liberate. Another sealed stone door marked the chamber, its faded magic offering no answers to growing collection of mysteries.

The narrow hallway beyond led to larger ritual chamber dominated by swirling portal of dark energy. Chains hung around the otherworldly gateway while bookshelves and workbenches lined walls in a perimeter that restricted movement. The furniture crowded the room's edges, channeling any movement toward the central portal.

[entity:7763295|Bruldin] shuddered as he entered, his sanctified nature reacting to overwhelming evil that saturated the space like physical presence. This room had witnessed horrors that transcended simple violence, experiments that violated natural law through necromantic ambition.

The meat puppets erupted from hiding with coordinated precision that suggested intelligence beyond their grotesque construction. Nine creatures of stitched smooth leather writhed and wriggled, their shiny black eyes fixed on intruders with hunger that spoke of dark purpose. They attacked from all directions—shelves, workbenches, elevated positions that transformed the chamber into three-dimensional battlefield.

[entity:7763289|Alrik] attempted to identify the creatures using religious knowledge, but learned nothing useful. These abominations represented necromantic experimentation beyond conventional undead classification. His divine strike missed despite careful aim, the combat starting poorly for an exhausted party already depleted from previous encounters.

The meat puppets demonstrated horrifying versatility. Some hung back and launched maggot-infested slime at [entity:7763295|Bruldin], the projectiles burning with poison that found purchase in existing wounds. Others rushed forward for melee attacks, their meat cleaver weapons and grasping hands coordinating flanking positions with unsettling tactical sophistication.

[entity:7763295|Bruldin] responded with violence that matched their grotesque nature, his maul crushing one completely and sending it flying. The creature died mid-flight, its destruction offering grim satisfaction against enemies that represented corruption of flesh and purpose.

[entity:7763296|Qotal] unleashed a sonic blast that caught three enemies in its area of effect. Two reeled from the assault, their stitched forms vibrating with the impact and rendering them unable to hear. The third weathered it better, though the sonic energy still tore at stitched leather and corrupted flesh.

The meat puppets on elevated positions launched themselves in bouncing attacks, descending on targets from above with combined impact and melee strikes. [entity:7763295|Bruldin] tried to intercept one mid-leap but missed, allowing the creature to complete its assault. Cleavers bit deep, opening wounds that bled freely.

Another bounced behind [entity:7763296|Qotal], establishing a flank that allowed coordinated attacks against the monk. Blades struck from multiple angles, testing his monastic defenses against creatures that attacked with mindless efficiency.

The battle extended through brutal exchanges, each draining resources they couldn't easily replace. The creatures' explosive death effect sprayed maggots on adjacent combatants when destroyed, larvae attempting to burrow into wounds and flesh. Their vomit attacks at point-blank range threatened continuous poisoning that accumulated faster than healing could address.

[entity:7763296|Qotal] attempted to grapple one for tactical repositioning into the swirling portal, his initial attempt failing badly. He tried again with desperation, but somehow performed even worse—an embarrassing fumble that mocked his effort. When he finally succeeded in getting a hold, his attempt to move while grappling failed catastrophically, leaving him holding a squirming creature while unable to execute his intended throw.

[entity:7763295|Bruldin's] emergency field medicine proved decisive when [entity:7763296|Qotal] grew dangerously weakened. The dwarf's technique was brutal—inflicting trauma to access deeper injuries—but effective. Despite the initial pain, the treatment restored enough vitality to keep the monk combat-effective through the grinding attrition.

[entity:7763290|Arnor's] lightning proved devastatingly effective, the creatures demonstrating vulnerability to electricity. When he finally identified the weakness through repeated application, his spell selection shifted to exploit it whenever possible.

[entity:7763289|Alrik's] sonic blasts caught multiple targets, while his newly acquired sword proved more effective than expected. The battle taught harsh lessons about enemy resistances and vulnerabilities, knowledge purchased through trial and error while strength drained away.

When the final meat puppet fell to combined assault, silence descended like exhaustion made audible. They had survived, but stood dangerously depleted. Strength flagged, wounds bled, and magical reserves ran dry.

The swirling portal continued its otherworldly rotation, occasionally launching vomit projectiles at random intervals. Rats and spiders continued sneaking from wall crevices. This chamber offered no sanctuary, only brief respite before pressing deeper into the necromancer's domain.

---

They rested as best they could in shifts—some guarding while others recovered what strength remained. [entity:7763296|Qotal] tended to [entity:7763290|Arnor's] wounds with careful efficiency, his treatment more successful than expected in restoring the wizard's vitality. They couldn't afford more time despite their depleted state. Every minute delayed gave the necromancer opportunity to prepare, to escape, to complete whatever experiments required captured victims.

The hallway beyond curved before opening into final chamber that lacked the portal feature of the previous room. Steps and elevation changes created tactical complexity, while something at the far end caught their attention—human skin "wings" that resolved into cloaks made from flayed flesh as they approached.

The necromancer stood revealed in full grotesque glory. Large and tall, with no visible eyes and horns covering her head like crown of bone. Her cloak of stitched skins from various creatures—some clearly human-sized—spoke of practices that transcended mere necromancy into artistic statement rendered in victim's flesh. Around her shuffled fleshless corpses of those same victims, their skinned bodies animated as walker and crawler troops that created difficult terrain wherever they shambled.

She sighed when she saw them enter, muttering in unfamiliar language before switching to Common with evident irritation. "I have no idea how you got beyond my gatherer, nor how you got in here. Obviously my work isn't as good as it used to be."

Her reference to [entity:7888221|the Jailor] as her "gatherer" confirmed the relationship they had suspected—the construct served as collector for her experimental subjects, its cage delivering victims to fate worse than clean death.

"Well, consider this your last chance to tell me," she continued, threat implicit in reasonable tone. "I shall very much enjoy vivisecting you to find out how you've become so good at this."

[entity:7763295|Bruldin] demonstrated his wisdom-not-intelligence philosophy through genuine confusion. "Is that supposed to intimidate me? I don't even know the meaning of the word 'vivisect.'"

The party deflected with humor about being "local neighborhood tax assessors" coming to audit her property, jokes about IRS and tariffs buying seconds while they assessed tactical situation. The necromancer possessed no patience for their theatrics.

Her opening assault demonstrated the magnitude of their challenge. She reached toward a glowing orb anchored in the chamber, magical energy transferring between them in visible connection. The pulse of necrotic magic she released washed over the entire party like a wave of mental fog.

Some resisted better than others. [entity:7763290|Arnor] shrugged off the effect entirely, while others felt their thoughts cloud and slow. The mental interference would persist through combat, reducing their effectiveness when they needed every advantage.

But the pulse revealed crucial intelligence—the strange magical connection between necromancer and orb suggested a power source that could be disrupted. [entity:7763289|Alrik] observed the pattern with tactical mind honed through unexpected adventures.

[entity:7763290|Arnor] responded with temporal magic, granting the party enhanced speed and mobility that would prove crucial in battle against troops that shambled across the chamber.

[entity:7763295|Bruldin] advanced through the shambling corpses, their mindless nature making them vulnerable to certain tactics. His combat instincts identified their weakness—"They're weak to area effects!"—knowledge gleaned from unexpected sources. His attacks against the necromancer missed despite reaching her position, but his aggressive advance forced a tactical response.

[entity:7763289|Alrik] summoned a spectral weapon in sword form that struck with sanctified power. The damage seemed reduced—she possessed resistance that blunted the effectiveness. Not the devastating impact they had hoped.

The walker troops shambled forward to surround [entity:7763290|Arnor], their fleshless bodies intact but skinless in grotesque display of the necromancer's methodology. They attacked in coordinated waves, bony limbs grasping and striking. The wizard dodged most of the assault, taking only glancing blows.

Crawler troops moved within range of [entity:7763295|Bruldin], launching another coordinated assault. The dwarf's reflexes saved him from the worst, weathering strikes that would have overwhelmed a lesser fighter. The troops demonstrated unsettling coordination despite their mindless shambling.

[entity:7763296|Qotal] attacked with limited success, his techniques forcing reliance on single-target strikes against enemies designed to absorb such attacks through sheer numbers.

The necromancer repeated her pattern—reaching to the orb, exchanging energies, releasing another burst of death magic. Dark energy washed over the party, draining life force from those who failed to resist. The repeated assault wore them down through accumulated harm that couldn't be easily addressed.

[entity:7763290|Arnor] attempted an area-effect spell, targeting multiple creatures in a concentrated burst. But the troops somehow resisted entirely, shrugging off the assault with inexplicable fortune. Resources expended for nothing.

[entity:7763295|Bruldin's] maul struck with devastating force, pulverizing multiple shambling corpses with a single blow. The troops seemed vulnerable to crushing impacts, bodies collapsing when struck hard enough. Even their mindless forms recoiled from his assault, attacks growing less coordinated.

The battle devolved into grinding attrition. Troops attacked in coordinated waves repeatedly, their mass assaults dealing steady harm that accumulated faster than the party could recover. [entity:7763290|Arnor's] needle darts chipped away at the walkers, while [entity:7763295|Bruldin's] massive maul strikes eliminated entire groups with crushing blows.

[entity:7763289|Alrik] observed the necromancer's pattern with tactical mind focused despite the mental fog. She drew power from the orb every turn—predictable rhythm that suggested vulnerability if properly exploited. He considered his options: disrupt the connection, reverse the polarity, transform the energy itself.

All options required careful timing with her power draw, sacrificing immediate action for potential strategic advantage. But disrupting her power source might prove more valuable than any individual attack.

He chose to prepare a dispelling magic, positioning himself to cast when she next reached toward the orb. The gamble meant preparing rather than striking, but his tactical instincts suggested the investment would pay dividends.

The troops continued their assault, coordinated waves wearing down defenses through persistent attacks. [entity:7763290|Arnor] and [entity:7763295|Bruldin] took steady hits, dodging what they could and enduring what they couldn't. [entity:7763296|Qotal's] attacks landed when opportunity permitted, his strikes effective against troops vulnerable to crushing impacts.

Then the necromancer reached for the orb again, magical energy transferring in the pattern [entity:7763289|Alrik] had observed and anticipated. He triggered his prepared spell, mental fog reducing his focus but not preventing the attempt.

Fortune favored the bold. His dispelling magic struck with perfect precision, exceeding her magical defenses despite his clouded thoughts. The orb's polarity reversed catastrophically, channeling positive energy instead of negative into the necromancer whose entire magical framework expected death energy's familiar corruption.

She shrieked—first sound of genuine distress they had heard from her—and stumbled backward through door they hadn't noticed. The secret passage swallowed her retreating form, door closing with finality that promised her escape rather than merely tactical withdrawal.

The troops, denied their commander's coordination, fought with mechanical persistence but reduced effectiveness. [entity:7763290|Arnor's] needle darts struck true, while [entity:7763295|Bruldin's] maul crushed through remaining walker troops with a blow that sent multiple fleshless bodies flying to stick against the wall in grotesque display.

[entity:7763289|Alrik's] spectral weapon struck the final crawler troops with devastating precision, slashing through what remained of their animation. The fleshless undead collapsed mid-shamble, whatever force sustained them finally failing without the necromancer's commanding will.

---

Silence descended like exhaustion made manifest. Four brutal encounters had pushed them beyond normal endurance, only determination and careful tactics preventing complete collapse. They had destroyed [entity:7888221|the Jailor], eliminated countless undead servants, and forced the necromancer herself into retreat.

But she had escaped. Somewhere beyond that secret door, the Fleshcrafter fled with knowledge of their capabilities and motivation to either prepare better defenses or abandon this lair entirely. The victory felt incomplete despite tactical success.

The secret door revealed stairs leading to upper level chamber—her personal quarters featuring large bed, furniture sized for her considerable height, and alcoves filled with tomes and magic items. Glowing pentagram marked the floor, potentially summoning or teleportation circle that explained her confidence in escape routes.

The entire lair radiated curse energy so powerful they realized they could only safely spend thirty minutes investigating before suffering increasingly severe negative effects. The spiritual wrongness that had pressed against them since entering [entity:8051165|Skull Rock] intensified here, concentrated malevolence that exceeded even the bone chamber's oppressive atmosphere.

They divided the limited time among available investigations—[entity:7763296|Qotal] examining stone tome and flayed corpses, [entity:7763289|Alrik] studying spiritual environment and soul pool properties, [entity:7763290|Arnor] analyzing magic tomes and pentagram circle, [entity:7763295|Bruldin] defending to provide investigation bonuses before examining the trash pile.

The knowledge they gained would prove valuable once assembled and analyzed, but immediate priority remained: leave this cursed place before it drained more than their strength. [entity:7763296|Qotal] collected correspondence written in Necral that none of them could read, documents that might reveal the Fleshcrafter's broader connections and purpose.

Multiple sealed stone doors throughout the complex remained mysterious—faded magic and no apparent opening mechanisms, their purpose unknown despite the party's victory over the dungeon's master. Another mystery added to growing collection.

---

They climbed from [entity:8051165|Skull Rock's] depths exhausted but alive, emerging into afternoon rain that felt cleansing after the spiritual corruption below. [entity:7764193|Osanna] lay unconscious where she had fallen, her vampire nature slowly recovering from the positive energy shock that had thrown her from the pedestal.

The cursed stone formation's field had dissipated with deactivation, [entity:7888221|the Jailor] stood destroyed in the depths, and the necromancer had fled through secret passages that might lead anywhere. They had eliminated the immediate threat to [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing] and the surrounding territories.

[entity:7763295|Bruldin] carried the documents they had found—correspondence written in Necral that none of them could read, along with notes about the sealed stone doors and their mysterious purposes. [entity:7763296|Qotal] had sketched the magical circles and recorded observations about the soul orb. [entity:7763290|Arnor] had marked the locations of the sealed doors on his rough map of the complex.

Above them, clouds lingered as [entity:7763289|Alrik] had predicted. Rain continued falling, washing blood and corruption from their weapons and armor. [entity:7764193|Osanna] stirred, consciousness returning with the confused disorientation of one who had been violently expelled from magical communion.

They helped her to her feet, shared what they had discovered in the depths, and began the journey back toward [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing] with evidence of the Fleshcrafter's operations and mysteries yet to unravel.
