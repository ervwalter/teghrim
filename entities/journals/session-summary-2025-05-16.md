# Roads Through Goblin Territory

## Session Overview

A diverse group of adventurers converged from across Septerra to join a caravan bound for Teghrim's Crossing. What began as a simple guard contract quickly escalated into a desperate fight for survival as organized goblin forces tested the party's mettle through increasingly dangerous ambushes.

## Story Developments

[entity:7763290|Arnór Josefson] departed the Norse port of [entity:7763868|Ni, Solstheim] aboard a trading vessel laden with grain, bound for the new Duergar port of [entity:7763870|Menoth-Derith]. Among his fellow passengers was [entity:7763693|Sylvia Mournhold], a young noble whose fine armor and matched rapiers marked her as someone of means. The journey proved tense, with sailors speaking in hushed tones of sea monsters lurking beneath the waves.

Meanwhile, [entity:7763296|Qotal] traveled with a merchant caravan from the [entity:7763168|Jade Kingdoms], crossing dangerous territories toward the same destination. His traveling companion, [entity:7763866|Lyn Chong], proved far more personable than the typical ascetic monks of the east. The elderly gentleman's warm demeanor put the Slaan at ease as they discussed their respective spiritual paths. When Lyn inquired about Qotal's purpose, the monk spoke cryptically of following whispers from [entity:7763144|Gia] to trace "a line carved in stone" that would end somewhere beyond the western hills.

In Menoth-Derith, [entity:7763295|Bruldin Grimstone] waited as caravans formed for the dangerous journey east. The new port city, built within the last decade, had a frontier feel with its fresh construction carved defensively into the coastal cliffs. When [entity:7763290|Arnór] and [entity:7763693|Sylvia] arrived with the Norse traders, and [entity:7763296|Qotal] appeared with the eastern merchants, a caravan leader quickly organized them alongside surly [entity:7763865|Vanguard Mercenaries] for the trek to [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing].

The leader offered simple terms: guard the caravan's rear in exchange for free passage and five to ten gold upon safe arrival. [entity:7763295|Bruldin], eager for the promise of "good fighting out west," readily agreed. His status as a member of the [entity:7763122|Dwarven Slayer Cults] earned immediate respect, the leader acknowledging they could "definitely use one of your type."

Days into their journey, at an abandoned [entity:7763869|caravanserai] marked with goblin totems, [entity:7763294|Aurelia] waited alone. The dhampir investigator had arrived early, using the waystation as a meeting point. Her solitude was broken when three snotlings - young goblins barely larger than children - crawled through gaps in the walls. Their innocent snooping turned violent when they discovered her presence. Drawing tiny daggers, they attacked, but Aurelia dispatched them with practiced efficiency. She drained their blood to replenish her vampiric reserves before disposing of the bodies, unaware these were scouts for a larger force.

When the caravan arrived the next afternoon, [entity:7763294|Aurelia] joined the rear guard without fanfare. As evening fell, the party worked to secure the caravanserai. [entity:7763295|Bruldin] drove defensive stakes around the perimeter while [entity:7763290|Arnór] attempted to set forest traps with limited success due to damp wood. [entity:7763296|Qotal] proved more successful, creating well-disguised tripwires inside the spike barrier. [entity:7763866|Lyn Chong] blessed the area with incense and prayers while [entity:7763693|Sylvia] directed workers in repairing the walls.

During [entity:7763295|Bruldin's] first watch, strange sounds erupted from the rear entrance - squeaks, crashes, and cursing in Goblinish. The dwarf's intimidating javelin throw prompted a response in accented Common. A large orc emerged from the darkness, demanding to know the whereabouts of his "little guys" who had gone missing while scouting. The party maintained their innocence as the orc grew increasingly agitated, eventually demanding a toll for passage through "their" territory. When [entity:7763295|Bruldin] refused, his **slayer tattoos** glowing faintly with battle-fury, the orc slammed his maul against the gate with such force that the chains snapped.

The battle was joined as six goblins rushed through alongside their orc leader. [entity:7763295|Bruldin's] rage took hold immediately, his first devastating strike combining bludgeoning force with spiritual energy to splatter a goblin against the defensive spikes. [entity:7763296|Qotal] tumbled gracefully between enemies, his staff work precise and lethal. [entity:7763290|Arnór] supported with **Needle Darts**, the spell carrying the properties of cold iron to wound the orc leader. [entity:7763294|Aurelia's] crossbow work proved deadly accurate, placing a bolt through a goblin's skull.

The tide turned when multiple goblins flanked [entity:7763295|Bruldin], their small blades finding gaps in his defenses until the mighty slayer collapsed under the orc boss's devastating strikes. [entity:7763296|Qotal] fell moments later to the orc's massive maul. In desperation, [entity:7763290|Arnór] called out "Natvig, help!" A mysterious creature burst from the forest, flying over the combatants before vanishing back into the trees, its presence somehow disrupting the orc's defenses. This distraction proved crucial - [entity:7763294|Aurelia] capitalized on the opening to drive her blade between the orc's eyes.

The surviving goblins fled as [entity:7763866|Lyn Chong] and the caravan healers stabilized the fallen warriors. The party's victory, though costly, earned the genuine appreciation of their fellow travelers.

Two days of travel through primeval forest followed, the ground occasionally shaking from the footfalls of distant giants and mammoths. At a more secure caravanserai, the party gathered around the evening fire. [entity:7763296|Qotal] played simple folk songs on his lute while [entity:7763290|Arnór] accompanied on flute. [entity:7763866|Lyn] offered flower tea and hummed along while [entity:7763693|Sylvia] sat with perfect noble posture, commending the party's martial prowess.

As they shared their stories, deeper purposes emerged. [entity:7763296|Qotal] revealed he sought a **moss-eaten carving of a warrior clutching a broken blade**, believing the broken sword's story would end somewhere beyond these hills. [entity:7763295|Bruldin] grew noticeably quiet at this description. [entity:7763866|Lyn Chong] spoke of his mission to restore an abandoned shrine near Teghrim's Crossing, one rumored to possess great healing power. [entity:7763693|Sylvia], clearly not the eldest child, admitted she had been "voluntold" to secure her family's trade interests. [entity:7763294|Aurelia] remained cryptic, mentioning only that she investigated something for "a friend" while folding origami animals. [entity:7763290|Arnór] simply sought his fortune in foreign lands, though his connection to the mysterious [entity:7763867|Natvig] suggested deeper mysteries.

The increasingly organized [entity:7763864|goblin raiders] struck again during the final stretch. First came a roadside ambush with sling-stones raining from the forest. [entity:7763290|Arnór's] **evil eye** symbol and [entity:7763295|Bruldin's] fearsome reputation sent many fleeing in panic. But worse followed - goblin riders mounted on **giant spiders** pursued the caravan, accompanied by **squigs**, bizarre bouncing creatures that were essentially mouths with legs. In the chaotic running battle, [entity:7763294|Aurelia] fell unconscious twice, saved only by [entity:7763866|Lyn's] healing touch. The party barely escaped, utilizing every skill at their disposal to discourage pursuit.

After three weeks of travel, the battered but victorious party finally glimpsed their destination. [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing] sprawled across a mighty river comparable to the Missouri, its massive bridge supporting buildings along its span. They had survived the [entity:7763864|goblin raiders], earned their promised gold, and begun forging the bonds that would define their adventures in this frontier settlement.

## Combat & Challenges

The caravanserai gate battle tested the party's coordination when six goblins and their orc leader breached the defenses. Despite superior individual skill, the enemy's flanking tactics proved devastating, dropping both [entity:7763295|Bruldin] and [entity:7763296|Qotal] before [entity:7763294|Aurelia] ended the orc with a desperate thrust between the eyes. The mysterious [entity:7763867|Natvig's] timely intervention turned certain defeat into narrow victory.

The running battle with spider-mounted goblins pushed the party to their limits. Racing alongside careening wagons while fending off riders, giant spiders, and bouncing squigs created a chaotic melee where [entity:7763294|Aurelia] fell multiple times despite her vampiric resilience. Only the combined efforts of the entire party and [entity:7763866|Lyn's] healing prevented tragedy.

## Discoveries & Lore

The frontier between [entity:7763870|Menoth-Derith] and [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing] has become increasingly dangerous as [entity:7763864|goblin raiders] organize under orc leadership. These aren't mere bandits but an organized force claiming territorial rights and demanding tolls from travelers. Their use of snotling scouts, spider cavalry, and trained squigs suggests military structure and resources.

The **Dramatis Personae** system was revealed - special NPCs who can become friends, teach skills or languages, and provide unique quests. [entity:7763693|Sylvia Mournhold] and [entity:7763866|Lyn Chong] represent two of at least five such characters the party must meet to advance.

Historical context emerged about the **Norn Terror**, a period when [entity:7763211|Norn] raiders ravaged coastlines worldwide, inadvertently spurring other races into their own age of exploration. This explains both the [entity:7763865|Vanguard Mercenaries'] defensive capabilities and the mixed reception Norse travelers receive in foreign ports.
