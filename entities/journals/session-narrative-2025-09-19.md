# Chapter 15 - Teeth and Towers

Morning broke clean on the second day of Orpheus with sunlight spilling through the mess hall windows at [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing]. [entity:7763296|Qotal] felt the difference immediately—the stupefying fog that had clouded his mind since [entity:8051165|Skull Rock] lifted like morning mist burned away by clarity's sudden heat. His thoughts moved with the precision he remembered from monastery days, each connection sharp and certain. The curse had finally released him.

He met [entity:7763290|Arnor], [entity:7763294|Aurelia], and [entity:7763289|Alrik] at breakfast with spirits lighter than they'd been in days. [entity:7764195|Gaz] served tables with her usual cheerful commentary, while a new face caught attention—Georgette, a bardish woman whose fingers danced across lute strings between serving rounds. The music added warmth to routine morning gathering, melodies suggesting sanctuary earned through recent trials.

The standard alarm bell rang with familiar urgency—guards summoned to handle disturbances that required attention but not panic. The party continued eating, unconcerned by bridge security matters that fell within expected parameters. Five minutes later, however, a different bell shattered the morning's peace—the emergency signal that demanded every capable fighter respond immediately.

The rats came through every entrance at once.

Rodents the size of dogs burst through doors, crashed through windows, and erupted from gaps in floorboards in waves that spoke of coordination beyond animal cunning. Their fur matted with filth from sewers and wilderness, teeth yellow and long as a child's fingers, bodies heavy with muscle built for violence. These weren't the occasional vermin that plagued any settlement—these were Rodents of Unusual Size, legends made flesh and hunger.

[entity:7763289|Alrik] reacted first, channeling divine power into [entity:7763296|Qotal] before the closest rat could close distance. The blessing settled over the monk like familiar weight, sharpening reflexes already honed through monastic discipline. [entity:7763296|Qotal] moved with supernatural speed, his staff appearing in his hands as he blurred forward to meet the nearest creature.

His first strike connected with the sound of breaking bone, staff finding gap between ribs with precision born from countless training hours. The blow drove deep, and before the rat could recover his second strike crushed its skull completely. The creature died mid-lunge, momentum carrying its corpse to crash at his feet.

But dozens more surged through gaps and windows, and the truly unsettling detail revealed itself through chaos: normal-sized rats perched on windowsills watching the assault unfold. These smaller rodents made no move to attack, their eyes tracking combatants with intelligence that made [entity:7763289|Alrik's] skin crawl when he studied them between defensive maneuvers.

Something controlled this swarm. Something that commanded military operations through creatures that should have operated on simple instinct.

Some rats flanked [entity:7763296|Qotal] and [entity:7764195|Gaz] with tactical positioning. Others double-teamed Georgette in coordinated assault. More moved to support their allies while maintaining advantageous spacing. The pattern spoke of drilling and discipline, attacks launched not in chaotic hunger but measured violence following plans laid before the first window shattered.

[entity:7763294|Aurelia] dropped her bow—too close for arrows—and drew her rapier with predator's grace. Her blade found one rat's heart with surgical strike, followed immediately by a second thrust that punched through another's ribs. Her precision training made her devastating when properly positioned.

[entity:7763290|Arnor's] needle darts caught fleeing creatures attempting to escape with stolen food. One rat, dragging a sack of cheese and cured meat, leaped toward window freedom only to be pinned mid-flight by a perfectly placed strike. The creature fell like it had tumbled into a cactus patch, quills jutting from every surface as life fled in squeaking protest.

More rats emerged from back rooms carrying supplies—coordinated theft operation executing beneath the cover of combat. Some dragged sacks nearly their own size, others clutched cheese wheels in powerful jaws, all moving with purpose that transcended opportunistic scavenging. This was professional operation, military raid disguised as vermin infestation.

[entity:7763289|Alrik's] storm burst caught multiple creatures in crackling discharge, eliminating one rat while damaging others. His divine magic proved effective against natural creatures, though the sheer number of attackers made each individual victory feel insufficient against the tide.

[entity:7763296|Qotal] parkoured over tables to block escape routes, his acrobatic style transforming furniture into battlefield advantages. He moved with such fluid speed that attacks struck where he'd been rather than where he stood, his monastery training turning near-hits into frustrated misses.

Then the watching rats began squeaking.

The signals carried across the swarm like officers' commands, and the remaining giant rats abandoned their attacks immediately. Stolen goods clutched in jaws or dragged across floors, they fled through every available exit with the same coordination they'd shown attacking. The party killed several more during the retreat, but most escaped—mission accomplished despite casualties, supplies secured despite resistance.

[entity:7763296|Qotal] stepped outside into larger nightmare. The entire bridge settlement faced coordinated assault from the eastern side—hundreds of giant rats conducting simultaneous raids across multiple locations. Guards fought desperately, their training tested against tactics that belonged to military operations rather than simple pest control.

The watching rats maintained command positions from elevated rocks, directing tactical withdrawals with squeaked orders before vanishing into whatever sewers or wilderness had spawned them. The professional execution suggested intelligence far beyond rodent cunning, coordination that required planning and communication.

The cleanup took twenty minutes of hard work, guards and adventurers working together to secure the bridge and assess damage. The raiders had succeeded—significant quantities of food stolen in systematic operation that demonstrated both capability and organization. This wasn't random attack but calculated strike against settlement resources.

---

The immediate crisis passed, attention turned to practical matters. Their recent experiences had taught them the value of better equipment, and [entity:7764097|Captain Irka Spritzel] offered payment terms for proven friends—twenty-five percent down on expensive items, with installments on the balance.

[entity:7763296|Qotal] ordered hand wraps of mighty punching with striking rune for one hundred gold, the enhancement affecting all his unarmed attacks. The investment would enable his full acrobatic combat style, transforming feet into weapons as deadly as his staff. He also acquired a pendant of the occult for sixty gold, the mystical jewelry promising benefits to his scholarly pursuits.

[entity:7763289|Alrik] invested heavily in survival, ordering half plate armor for three hundred sixty gold and a minor sturdy shield for one hundred. The armor upgrade would provide desperately needed protection after recent combats where enemies struck him with alarming consistency. His staff of healing for ninety gold allowed spellcasting while the shield remained equipped, and the lesser everair mask for five gold spoke to trauma from underwater combat he never wanted to repeat.

"Can breathe underwater for an hour," he explained when [entity:7763296|Qotal] questioned the purchase. "Worth every copper after last time."

The memory of drowning's cold embrace made the investment seem reasonable despite their river-focused campaign geography. Several party members ordered their own masks, insurance against aquatic disasters.

[entity:7763294|Aurelia] enhanced her bow with potency and striking runes—thirty-five gold available immediately, sixty-five more on delivery. [entity:7764195|Gaz] arranged free installation through her contacts, waiving normal fees with cheerful conspiracy that suggested her network extended further than most realized.

"Got connections," she explained with wink that promised future benefits. "You keep being interesting, I'll keep making introductions."

---

The days following settled into rhythms that felt almost like peace despite the rat swarm's implications. [entity:7763296|Qotal] spent time with [entity:7764102|Aelysh], sharing knowledge of medicinal plants from [entity:7763174|Primordia] while learning about her scientific approach to botanical research. They discussed orchids that grew where air tasted of copper, bark that could heal or harm depending on moon phase, the patterns nature wrote in leaf and root for those patient enough to read.

Their teaching progressed smoothly, scholars sharing passion for understanding living systems. The second day brought conversation flowing through topics that ranged from practical herbalism to theoretical ecology. On the third day, their discussions deepened into genuine friendship—a breakthrough achieved through mutual respect and complementary knowledge.

[entity:7763296|Qotal] and [entity:7764102|Aelysh] had forged a bond through patient teaching and scholarly exchange.

[entity:7763290|Arnor] focused entirely on [entity:7764193|Osanna Von Carstein], spending days gossiping about recent events including rumors of new witch cult and supernatural politics that fascinated them both. Through their discussions, he learned she could teach Aklo—the tongue of aberrations and dark entities that spoke to her vampiric nature's deeper connections.

The second day deepened their connection even further. [entity:7763290|Arnor] and [entity:7764193|Osanna] forged genuine friendship built on mutual interest in occult mysteries and supernatural politics, trust that transcended typical patron-adventurer dynamics.

[entity:7763294|Aurelia] pursued friendship with [entity:7763693|Sylvia Mournhold] using acrobatics as common ground. After some initial awkwardness, the two found their rhythm, spending the day practicing movement arts, formal dance techniques, and discussing their shared appreciation for physical expression through controlled motion.

She also spent time with [entity:7763866|Lyn Chong], their conversations revealing his secret: the elderly monk suffered melancholy when alone, singing and working but falling into depression without social contact. The vulnerability he showed spoke to trust earned through shared trials.

[entity:7763295|Bruldin] worked to befriend [entity:7764097|Captain Irka], their shared dwarven heritage providing natural common ground. After persistent effort, the captain and slayer forged friendship that acknowledged [entity:7763295|Bruldin's] proven capabilities and opened new training opportunities.

On Orpheus 3rd morning, [entity:7763866|Lyn Chong] approached with expression that carried weight beyond simple concern. The rat attack patterns matched operations he'd witnessed in the [entity:7763168|Jade Kingdoms]—Skaven activities, rat people who formed symbiotic communities near civilizations.

"They're opportunistic scavengers," he explained, his Common flavored with accent that spoke of distant eastern lands. "Get into sewers, conduct nighttime raids, carry disease and pestilence. Sometimes form unusual religious cults."

Most concerning: Skaven always operated in paired clans, one male-led and one female-led. The simultaneous attacks on bridge settlement and his shrine construction site confirmed multiple coordinated groups working in the region.

[entity:7763295|Bruldin] declared with conviction that transcended diplomatic caution: "This threat must be taken care of."

The party agreed to investigate when they returned from other pressing matters, adding Skaven investigation to their growing mystery board. The complexity troubled those who understood frontier politics—in the [entity:7763168|Jade Kingdoms], Skaven had successfully integrated into society through waste management and sewer maintenance. Attacking them might eliminate potential allies who handled necessary but unpleasant services.

Yet their raids and disease-carrying nature posed genuine threats to settlements where plague could kill more efficiently than any monster.

On Orpheus 5th morning, strange events marked their departure. Guards repeatedly shooed ravens from the mess hall building, but one persistent bird kept returning to peck at the same spot. [entity:7763867|Natvig], [entity:7763290|Arnor's] trash griffin familiar, investigated the area that drew such focused attention.

The marks proved to be druidic runes from Celtic branch of drune magic—not [entity:7763290|Arnor's] tradition. The implication troubled those familiar with magical politics: Celtic druids watched the party, sending messages through corvid servants for purposes unknown.

They set out for the [entity:8248773|Highland Uplands] carrying Mendel's pastries purchased from [entity:7764195|Gaz] for two gold with friendship discount. The premium baked goods would serve as toll payment for Grogug, the troll who guarded the waterfall path to the highlands above.

They found him at his checkpoint, immediately noticing the missing arm. The massive creature explained with pragmatic acceptance that several days prior—around Aestra-Orpheus 30th or 31st, just after the party cleared [entity:8051165|Skull Rock]—a tall woman had passed through. No visible eyes, weird horns, contemptuous refusal to pay toll.

"Sliced off my arm when I demanded payment," Grogug rumbled, gesturing with his remaining limb. "Ate it afterward. Can't let good arm go to waste. Regrow in month or two."

The description matched [entity:8244510|the Fleshcrafter] perfectly—the necromancer who'd escaped their dungeon assault had fled into these highlands rather than seeking her Necarch contacts or returning to civilization. Either she possessed hideout in wild territories, or something made even powerful necromancer choose isolation over organizational support.

The climb through the waterfall series proved spectacular. Crude but troll-sized paths wound up multiple cascades with mountains pressing close on both sides. From the top, a breathtaking vista revealed [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing] far below like a miniature settlement, with [entity:7764193|Osanna's] island mansion visible and the river stretching beyond into distant territories.

But when the party emerged from the ravine onto the highland plateau, the world behind them seemed to close like a gate. Looking back created an oppressive sensation—familiar valley and settled lands vanished from perception, replaced by a psychological boundary between civilization and true wilderness.

The sensation felt wrong in ways that transcended simple geography, a wrongness that pressed against consciousness like physical weight. Some force separated these highlands from the lowlands, whether natural boundary or magical demarcation remained uncertain.

---

The river split into two branches before them. One flowed toward a distant lake, the other hugged mountains between peaks into unexplored territory. Following the highland terrain, they discovered ruins—ancient buildings showing evidence of past habitation.

[entity:7763296|Qotal] studied the structures carefully, his engineering knowledge revealing them as old [entity:7766459|hob] construction from approximately fifty years ago. Domesticated goblins had lived in these uplands before the bridge was built, migrating down to the lowlands when opportunity called. Even then, this hadn't been their original homeland—merely a waypoint in longer migration patterns whose origins remained lost to history.

A crude burial ground nearby showed typical [entity:7766459|hob] maintenance: poor foresight in securing graves against disturbance, signs of either natural degradation or deliberate robbery. Among the disturbed sites, [entity:7763294|Aurelia] identified a magical item—an animal staff carved with raven imagery.

The staff granted assistance with identifying animals and could cast useful cantrips, but proved too narrow and fragile for melee combat. Its resale value of ninety gold represented its primary utility for combat-focused party members.

They camped overnight in the highlands, hiding their campfire after hearing tribal drumming echo through the darkness. [entity:7763289|Alrik], [entity:7763290|Arnor], and [entity:7763294|Aurelia] pooled their knowledge to identify the rhythm as ogre drums—distinctly different from orc drumming they'd experienced at the moot gathering.

The party extinguished their fire and spent an anxious night hearing crashes and movement through the woods as something large blundered through the forest with casual disregard for stealth. Morning brought the drumming to silence but not the crashing sounds—whatever made those noises approached with an inevitability that suggested territorial claim rather than random wandering.

[entity:7763296|Qotal] heard the approaching footsteps first. Three ogres emerged from the trees with a presence that filled the clearing like storm clouds gathering.

The first wielded sword and javelin with scarred competence. The second carried great axe that promised devastating strikes if it connected. The third—female leader variant whose staff and axe combination spoke to command authority—advanced with confidence that suggested these highlands belonged to her kind, and intruders would be dealt with accordingly.

They attacked without negotiation, territorial aggression requiring no diplomatic preamble.

---

[entity:7763289|Alrik] opened with spiritual armor for protection and manifested his spiritual weapon as a bastard sword, striking the sword-wielding ogre with divine force. The creature responded by hurling its javelin at [entity:7763296|Qotal] before closing to melee range with speed that belied its bulk.

[entity:7763294|Aurelia] demonstrated her lethal precision, flanking the sword ogre and striking with her rapier. The blade delivered devastating wounds that would have killed lesser creatures, but highland ogres possessed resilience built through survival in territories where weakness meant death.

The Ogre Lady proved most dangerous, slamming her staff into the ground before charging. She bit [entity:7763294|Aurelia], drawing blood, then tried to grab the dhampir but failed against the investigator's trained defensive instincts.

[entity:7763296|Qotal] responded by sweeping the sword ogre's legs, sending the creature crashing prone. His rapid strikes found its face, staff finding gaps in defensive posture that proper stance would have prevented.

[entity:7763294|Aurelia's] next attack proved decisive for the sword ogre. Maintaining her flanking position, she drove her rapier "straight through the kidneys." The brutal strike hit nerve clusters that transformed pain into systemic shock, and the ogre screamed in agony before fleeing from combat. It staggered away clutching ruined organs, removed from the fight entirely by surgical precision that targeted vulnerabilities rather than simply dealing damage.

[entity:7763295|Bruldin] entered the fray with devastating effect. His blade struck the Ogre Lady with tremendous force, nearly splitting the female ogre in half. The champion staggered, bloodied by an assault that would have killed most warriors outright.

[entity:7763294|Aurelia] capitalized on the opening, stepping forward and striking with another perfectly placed thrust. The Ogre Lady collapsed dead before hitting the ground, the leader eliminated through coordinated assault that demonstrated the party's tactical evolution.

The party had faced ogres before, but here [entity:7763294|Aurelia] claimed all three through a combination of the weakening kidney strike, the devastating thrust that felled the leader, and the final blow on the remaining axe ogre. Her companions joked about her growing reputation: "Aurelia, the Vampire Ogre Killer," referencing both her dhampir heritage and tendency to execute the largest opponents.

The remaining axe ogre fell to concentrated attacks—[entity:7763290|Arnor's] needle darts piercing vital areas, [entity:7763296|Qotal's] flanking strikes, and [entity:7763289|Alrik's] spiritual weapon maintaining pressure until the creature's resilience finally failed.

---

As the party caught their breath after combat, [entity:7763295|Bruldin] and [entity:7763294|Aurelia] both noticed they were being watched. Both spotted the one-eyed bird-like creature perched in nearby trees, watching their victory with obvious interest through that single massive eye.

[entity:7763295|Bruldin] attempted communication first, calling out: "Hello, my friend. I have learned more about you. Why are you here? We thought your main form was gone. We are interested to learn more about you if you would like to communicate at some point. We come in peace, but only for learning and knowledge."

The creature stared with its single massive eye but showed no response to words alone. Language meant nothing to a manifestation that existed beyond mortal communication.

Then [entity:7763295|Bruldin] remembered the melody—the mystical tune [entity:7764101|the Willow Dryad] had taught them specifically for communicating with Genovian's emanations. He began performing the song with [entity:7763294|Aurelia's] assistance, their voices blending in harmony.

The one-eyed creature reacted immediately. It began waddling and stomping its feet in rhythm, jigging back and forth in obvious pleasure at hearing the familiar melody. The response confirmed everything the dryad had told them—this was indeed an emanation of Genovian, the Espada who had once lived in these waterfall highlands before the last Breath of the Nexus.

The ancient tune carried harmonics that connected to forces dwelling in ley line nexuses where concentrated magical energy pooled. The song represented a key to understanding the mysteries accumulating around them—Genovian's persistent emanations, the forest's subtle wrongness, the Breath of the Nexus whose timing should have sent her elsewhere decades or centuries ago.

After the performance ended, the creature hopped off its perch and took flight, heading southeast following the ravine toward valleys between mountains. The party had their guide. Genovian's emanation would lead them forward, waddling and hopping through the highland wilderness, drawing them deeper into territories where melodies spoke louder than words and ancient forces dwelt in harmony with the wild.
