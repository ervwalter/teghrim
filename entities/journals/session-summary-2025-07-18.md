# Like Tears in the Rain

## Session Overview

After earning orc respect and advancing to third level, [entity:7763296|Qotal], [entity:7763294|Aurelia], and [entity:7763289|Alrik] spent time building relationships with key allies at [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing]. Their diplomatic efforts were interrupted by the investigation of a supernatural storm that had plagued the region for decades, leading them to uncover and resolve the tragic binding of two spirits from the bridge construction era.

## Story Developments

The day began with relationship-building activities as the party invested downtime to strengthen bonds with important residents. [entity:7763296|Qotal] spent time with [entity:7764102|Aelysh] at her [entity:7764106|treehouse preserve], learning about her scientific approach to botanical research and witnessing her treatment of fungal infections from their previous mission. His knowledge of distant flora and fauna from [entity:7763174|Primordia] impressed the [entity:7763217|wood elf], earning her friendship and securing her promise to assist with future investigations.

[entity:7763289|Alrik] engaged [entity:7764196|Rosencrantz] in philosophical debate about the intersection of engineering and divine craftsmanship. Despite the **mechamagician's** atheist perspective clashing with [entity:7763289|Alrik's] devotion to [entity:7763157|Talos], their intellectual discourse proved so engaging that [entity:7764196|Rosencrantz] offered lodging in his converted [entity:7764199|laboratory tower]. Meanwhile, [entity:7763294|Aurelia] revealed her dhampir heritage to [entity:7764193|Osanna Von Carstein], winning a bet for the vampire noble against her attendant [entity:7797911|Silas], who had apparently wagered on [entity:7763294|Aurelia] being something else entirely.

During the revelation, [entity:7763294|Aurelia] shared that her quest related to her sister - described as **"Lamian"** and **"whole-blood Lamian"** - providing new context for her mysterious mission. [entity:7764193|Osanna] spoke of rivalry between the three vampire bloodlines but welcomed [entity:7763294|Aurelia] regardless, offering dining arrangements through [entity:7797911|Silas's] delivery service.

Their rest was disrupted by an intense thunderstorm with unexplained explosions echoing through the night. [entity:7763294|Aurelia's] exceptional survival skills revealed that the storm originated from the west, toward the [entity:7763865|Iron Kingdoms], but remained stationary rather than approaching naturally. [entity:7763289|Alrik's] critical analysis confirmed this was **definitely an unnatural phenomenon**, prompting the party to investigate.

[entity:7764195|Gaz] at the mess hall strongly advised against approaching the storm area, revealing that someone she knew had **"never came back"** from investigating it. She described how older [entity:7763187|bridge folk] remained superstitious about what they called a **"dragon cyclone"** that had taken people in the past. The storm returned **"every few years, like a friend you don't like,"** establishing its supernatural persistence.

**Georgette** provided crucial historical context from the bridge construction era decades ago. She told of **Midora**, a young woman, and **Echin**, a man infatuated with her. Echin had planned a surprise and taken Midora into the forest, after which both disappeared. The storm began **the next day after their disappearance**, connecting the supernatural weather to their fate. Local interpretations varied between **"her tears"** crying in anguish and **"nature's angry with something that was done."**

With [entity:7764102|Aelysh] joining as their fourth member, the party departed for the storm investigation site. The journey through muddy forest took until mid-afternoon, where [entity:7763294|Aurelia's] exceptional perception allowed them to triangulate the storm's center by evening. [entity:7763289|Alrik] found excellent shelter for their camp, though [entity:7763296|Qotal's] fortification attempts proved ineffective against the persistent rain.

During his watch, [entity:7763296|Qotal] spotted the **mysterious one-eyed creature** that had observed them previously - a raven-sized, shadowy bird-like being that watched from the trees before vanishing. [entity:7764102|Aelysh] identified it as likely a forest spirit and warned of the **enchanted forest** to the southwest, where some who enter never return.

## Combat & Challenges

The investigation led them into dense supernatural fog that induced visions of **terror, loneliness, anguish, remorse and regret** despite successful saves. Within the mist, they encountered a **Will-o-Wisp** that fed on their fear while remaining invisible between attacks. The battle tested their ability to fight blind opponents, with [entity:7764102|Aelysh] proving surprisingly effective with blind strikes that scored both regular hits and critical damage. [entity:7763294|Aurelia's] tactical use of blind attacks and [entity:7763296|Qotal's] devastating **flurry of blows** ultimately destroyed the creature.

At the storm's center, ancient stone ruins contained the spirits of the missing lovers. **Echin** appeared as a corporeal middle-aged man who insisted he had **"been here the entire time"** despite decades passing. When the party discovered his magical mural depicting **Midora** and [entity:7763294|Aurelia] tested it with her sword, Echin's true nature as a bound ghost emerged. His **frightful moan** and **ghostly hand** attacks proved dangerous, forcing the party to seek an alternative approach.

The encounter with **Midora's** spirit near stone circles revealed the truth: Echin had brought her with **"tales of love"** then magically bound her against her will through the mural ritual. Her plea for liberation led to [entity:7763289|Alrik] performing a complex divine ritual using religion checks, successfully breaking the decades-old binding that had trapped both spirits.

## Discoveries & Lore

The investigation uncovered a tragic tale of obsessive love and supernatural binding from the bridge construction era. **Echin's** magical ritual had attempted to win **Midora's** affection but instead trapped them both as spirits, creating the recurring storms that plagued the region. The Will-o-Wisp feeding on their anguish added another layer to the supernatural ecosystem created by the unresolved tragedy.

[entity:7763289|Alrik's] successful ritual revealed the theological complexity of using divine power to undo dark magic. The liberation required specific ritual components - an **antique lantern and shovel** - found preserved in a cart at the ruins. When the binding broke, time caught up to **Echin** rapidly, aging him into dust, while **Midora's** spirit departed gratefully on the wind. The storms immediately cleared, ending decades of supernatural weather.

The party discovered a **javelin of lightning** among the ruins, though concerns about its power level for their experience suggested it might require adjustment. The resolution of the storm mystery also connected to broader questions about the **one-eyed creature** that continued observing them and the **enchanted forest** [entity:7764102|Aelysh] had warned about.

## Quest Updates

- **Like Tears in the Rain** - Completed successfully: supernatural storms ended through liberation of bound spirits **Midora** and **Echin**
- **Dramatis Personae Relationships** - Significant progress: [entity:7763296|Qotal] befriended [entity:7764102|Aelysh], [entity:7763289|Alrik] befriended [entity:7764196|Rosencrantz], [entity:7763294|Aurelia] deepened connection with [entity:7764193|Osanna Von Carstein]
- **Vampire Heritage Investigation** - New information: [entity:7763294|Aurelia's] sister confirmed as **"whole-blood Lamian"**, vampire bloodline rivalries mentioned
- **Regional Exploration** - New option: waterfall hex (G4) selected for future exploration mission

## Next Steps

With the supernatural storm resolved and their relationships with key allies strengthened, the party can focus on [entity:7764097|Captain Irka's] exploration and mapping assignments. The selected waterfall hex (G4) offers their next adventure, described as a series of waterfalls due to mountain elevation changes. Their growing influence with [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing] residents provides new resources: [entity:7764102|Aelysh's] nature expertise and healing benefits, [entity:7764196|Rosencrantz's] tower lodging and engineering knowledge, and [entity:7764193|Osanna's] vampire connections. The mysterious **one-eyed creature** continues observing them, and [entity:7764102|Aelysh's] warnings about the **enchanted forest** suggest future supernatural encounters await in the region.
