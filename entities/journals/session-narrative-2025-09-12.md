# Chapter 14 - Songs of Forgotten Spirits

The days after returning from the orc moot settled into rhythms that felt almost like peace. [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing] hummed with its usual chaos—merchants haggling at the general store, guards drilling on the training grounds, the mess hall filling with smells of roasted meat and fresh bread. For those who had descended into [entity:8051165|Skull Rock's] cursed depths and earned respect through combat at an orc gathering, mundane settlement life provided welcome refuge.

[entity:7763296|Qotal] spent his mornings beside [entity:7764102|Aelysh], learning the patience required to shape living wood. The elf's treehouse took form slowly, each board measured twice and fitted with care that bordered on meditation. She spoke of plants from distant regions while they worked, her scientific curiosity matching his scholarly nature. He shared knowledge of medicinal flora from [entity:7763174|Primordia], describing orchids that grew where the air tasted of copper and trees whose bark could heal wounds or induce visions depending on the moon phase. Through their work together, [entity:7764102|Aelysh] began teaching him forest lore, sharing observations about how plants revealed the health of their ecosystem. Their friendship deepened through shared appreciation for nature's patterns written in leaf and root.

[entity:7763294|Aurelia] cultivated connections of different sort. She spent hours with [entity:7764195|Gaz], the chatty [entity:7766459|hob] server whose gossip network spread through the settlement like morning fog. They talked over cups of something that resembled tea while [entity:7764195|Gaz] complained about the creature on her arm—the thing had bitten several other goblins now, spreading through the hob community with persistence that suggested intelligence or purpose.

"Does it hurt?" [entity:7763294|Aurelia] asked with investigator's interest masked as friendly concern.

"Nah, just annoying. Itches sometimes." [entity:7764195|Gaz] waved dismissively, more interested in sharing rumors about new arrivals and settlement politics. "But hey, you need weapons fixed? I know a guy. Won't charge you nothing for rune work."

The connection proved valuable—free maintenance on magical equipment could save considerable gold over time. [entity:7763294|Aurelia] filed the information away with satisfaction, another thread woven into her expanding network.

[entity:7763295|Bruldin] forged friendship with [entity:7764100|Gierr Bjornson] through means that required fewer words. They sparred in the training yard, the gruff [entity:7763211|Norn] hunter testing the dwarf's defenses with strikes that spoke of decades hunting dangerous prey. Between bouts they shared observations about territorial boundaries, tracking signs, and the practical mathematics of survival in lands where civilization ended at bridge's edge. [entity:7764100|Gierr] mentioned his wasp problem again—the invasive insects growing bolder near his apiaries—but offered no immediate request for aid.

[entity:7763289|Alrik] attempted friendship with [entity:7764097|Captain Irka Spritzel] through performance of traditional dwarven poetry. The verses praised ancestors and celebrated glorious battles in meter that required precise cadence to deliver properly. He rolled the words across his tongue with chef's attention to presentation, each syllable measured like ingredient in complex recipe.

[entity:7764097|Irka] listened with appreciation that didn't quite reach enthusiasm. "Good delivery, Grimmelstang. You honor the old ways." He clapped the chef's shoulder with respect that felt genuine. "But poetry isn't my preferred—well, perhaps we'll talk more another time."

The rejection stung less than it might have. At least the captain recognized effort and cultural understanding. [entity:7763289|Alrik] would try again with different approach, learning [entity:7764097|Irka's] preferred language through observation.

His nights guarding the bridge proved less restful. Strange raven creatures harassed the watch, their attacks following pattern that suggested malicious intelligence. They descended from darkness, forced guards to respond, then retreated before proper engagement. Minutes later they returned, repeating the harassment through hours that should have been quiet contemplation. By morning [entity:7763289|Alrik] felt exhausted despite technically resting through his watch rotation.

[entity:7763290|Arnor] spent his day with [entity:7764193|Osanna Von Carstein], sharing details of their discoveries beneath [entity:8051165|Skull Rock]. The vampire noble received them in her study, maps and correspondence spread across polished wood that reflected lamplight like dark water.

"Necarch," she said when he described [entity:7763296|Vilis Gavrik] and the soul well network. Her expression combined disgust with political calculation. "Here. Operating outside [entity:7763172|Astoria]."

She explained with patience born from centuries navigating supernatural politics. The [entity:8244549|Necarch] represented one of several major vampire factions, their obsession with arcane experimentation and self-modification setting them apart from bloodlines like her own [entity:7764192|Von Carstein] clan. They modified themselves until natural appearance became distant memory—some lacking eyes entirely, sporting horns or features that belonged to nightmares rather than any recognizable ancestry.

"They serve them, the Strigoi do," [entity:7764193|Osanna] continued, her distaste evident. "Vampires so morphed they barely qualify as such. All twisted features and unnatural capabilities."

The relationships between vampire factions remained precarious at best, maintained through influence of elders like Viktor von Carstein—founder of [entity:7764193|Osanna's] bloodline and current keeper of balance between clans that occasionally fought open wars. Her position as von Carstein representative severely limited what help she could provide against [entity:8244549|Necarch] operations without risking larger political consequences.

"Share anything you learn," she requested with directness that transcended diplomatic nicety. "My bloodline would find such intelligence... valuable."

She confirmed that capturing slaves for experiments represented standard [entity:8244549|Necarch] methodology—the soul well concept, however, remained unknown to her. If the party discovered why they harvested souls, what purpose drove this infrastructure across frontier territories, that knowledge could shift power balances between factions operating in shadows.

[entity:7763290|Arnor] left with mind full of supernatural politics more complex than any mortal government, wondering how their frontier adventures intersected with ancient conflicts between immortal powers.

On the morning of Aestra-Orpheus 35th, they prepared for travel with purpose that transcended simple exploration. The mystery of the one-eyed creature demanded answers—the entity had attacked them, observed them, demonstrated abilities that defied normal classification. [entity:7764102|Aelysh] had suggested consulting the rescued dryads, and the party trusted her botanical expertise to guide them toward truth.

Eight miles on established roads, then two through the [entity:7765159|Weeping Woods] where they had previously investigated supernatural storms. The familiar territory allowed rapid travel, and they camped in explored hexes where previous victories had established relative safety. [entity:7763294|Aurelia] consumed one of her blood tokens overnight, the careful rationing of vampiric heritage's demands always lurking beneath surface civility.

Morning of Orpheus 1st marked the new month and new exploration. They moved through forested wilderness with established watch rotations—[entity:7763289|Alrik] scouting using survival instincts honed through unexpected adventures, [entity:7763290|Arnor] and [entity:7763296|Qotal] searching for signs and secrets, [entity:7763294|Aurelia] detecting magical emanations through investigator training.

The bellowing erupted from underbrush with volume that shook leaves from branches. Massive shapes crashed through foliage—dire boars whose species name Daedon carried weight among those who hunted dangerous game. Their thick hides bristled with matted fur over muscle built for violence, tusks long as daggers curving from jaws that could crush bone like kindling.

The larger beast charged [entity:7763294|Aurelia] with speed that belied its bulk. Its tusks caught her chest and lifted, tossing her backward to crash prone against earth that drove air from lungs. Before she could rise, it gored her again—the second impact leaving her reeling and bloodied, gasping for breath.

[entity:7763295|Bruldin] responded with fury that transcended tactics. He entered rage that transformed pain into fuel, his maul Vierna singing through air to connect with the boar's skull in a devastating strike. The impact shattered bone—the beast's eye socket collapsed, blood spraying across scarred dwarven flesh while the creature's bellow shifted from aggression to fear.

The second boar targeted [entity:7763296|Qotal], its charge blocked by the monk's defensive stance. Staff met tusks in percussion that echoed through forest, the [entity:7763230|Slaan's] technique creating afterimages that turned certain strikes into frustrated misses. His counterattack found gaps between ribs with precision born from monastic training.

But the first Daedon remained fixated on [entity:7763294|Aurelia]. It charged again, tusks tearing through flesh and muscle until she collapsed—consciousness fading, body shutting down from trauma that exceeded mortal limits.

"[entity:7763290|Natvig]!" [entity:7763296|Qotal] commanded his familiar without hesitation. "Elixir, now!"

The trash griffin familiar swooped with bottle clutched in talons, depositing the alchemical healing into [entity:7763294|Aurelia's] mouth with practiced precision. The elixir—safe for dhampirs unlike magical positive energy—restored just enough life to drag her back from death's precipice. She woke barely alive, every breath agony, vision swimming.

[entity:7763295|Bruldin] crushed the first Daedon with another devastating blow, blood spattering across his grinning face. "Aurelia, I found your lunch!" The grim humor wasn't far from truth—fresh blood called to vampiric heritage regardless of immediate priorities.

The second beast fought with ruthless violence characteristic of its species, and when [entity:7763294|Aurelia] finally pierced its heart with rapier thrust that should have ended it, the creature refused to fall. Death could not claim it despite mortal wound, rage sustaining function beyond biological possibility.

[entity:7763296|Qotal] ended its defiance with casual punch to the head. "No tears," he murmured. "Only dreams now."

---

They treated wounds with field medicine and magical healing, [entity:7763289|Alrik's] surprisingly skilled ministrations achieving results that belied the technique's dangerous reputation. [entity:7763294|Aurelia] recovered enough to continue, though the memory of death's cold embrace lingered in trembling hands and quickened pulse.

Late that day, her investigator's eye began catching inconsistencies. Trees stood slightly wrong, like stage props positioned by someone who understood forests academically but not instinctively. Rocks failed to match geological patterns, their placement too deliberate for natural erosion. She shared observations the next morning, and those with nature training recognized deliberate concealment—illusion woven through physical displacement to hide what shouldn't be found by casual travelers.

They explored based on her deductions, and the forest opened like manuscript revealing hidden text. An enormous willow tree dominated the clearing, its branches swaying despite still air.

The tree moved. Bark shifted, taking form that transcended simple animation. The [entity:7764101|Willow Dryad] emerged with presence that filled the glade like morning light, her expression combining surprise and genuine pleasure.

"Greetings friends, it is good to see you back."

[entity:7763296|Qotal] stepped forward with posture that acknowledged her nature's sacred weight. "My name is Kothkatha." His formal tone carried slightly archaic phrasing he employed with spirits and forest guardians. "It has been many weeks since we met. You surely do not remember me."

"Oh, no. How could I forget?" The dryad's warmth transcended diplomatic courtesy. "You had saved me from the spider creatures." She regarded them with expression that held centuries of memory compressed into single moment of recognition. "The intrepid mortalborn that had helped me in my time of need."

She noticed [entity:7763295|Bruldin] with curiosity—he hadn't participated in that earlier rescue. Her gaze lingered on [entity:7763290|Natvig] with interest that suggested the trash griffin familiar represented something unusual even by forest spirit standards.

"I am surprised to see you in this dangerous place," she continued. "What brings you to explore here?"

[entity:7763296|Qotal] explained their search for information about strange forest spirits, describing the one-eyed creature that oscillated between passive observation and hostile manifestation, its ability to transform into mist suggesting supernatural rather than natural origin.

The dryad's expression shifted to thoughtful concern. "It attacked you, you said?" She considered their description with attention that suggested pieces fitting into larger pattern. "Aelysh sent you to me about this?"

When they confirmed, she nodded slowly. "There used to be, a long time ago, an Espada that lived in this area."

[entity:7763296|Qotal] straightened, scholarly interest overriding diplomatic restraint. The term *Espada* resonated with something in his mysterious background, knowledge he carried from monastery training or inherited memory. "Tell me more about Espada. And ley lines."

The dryad settled into teaching posture, sharing lore accumulated across timespans that made mortal lifetimes seem like brief candle flames. The Espada—also called Rhonqar—existed between elemental and mortal, tied to ley line nexuses where concentrated magical energy pooled. This particular entity, named Genovian, associated with mist and lived near the positive ley line nexus in the elevated waterfall region where the party had previously fought corrupted spirits.

"She was a fairly kind person," the dryad recalled with fondness that transcended simple observation. "Taught songs to young forest creatures, melodies that calmed and connected to the ley line's rhythm."

But Genovian should have departed long ago, before the last Breath of the Nexus—those periodic exhalations of massive natural power when ley lines released accumulated energy in pulses that marked time for forest-born who didn't count seasons beyond one or two. The dryad hadn't seen Genovian since that ancient pulse, making her emanations' persistence deeply puzzling.

"The nexus shifts," she explained, gesturing toward distant mountains. "Ley lines don't run straight—they arc and move like energy itself. The nexus stays in that elevated region, somewhere up where waterfalls feed from mountain heights."

She summoned a small forest spirit—leshy-type creature with white face mask—that sang one of Genovian's mystical tunes. The melody carried harmonics that didn't quite fit mortal musical theory, rhythms suggesting connection to forces deeper than simple art.

"Play this near her emanations," the dryad instructed. "It may calm them, lead you to her location."

She offered alternative path: deep in the [entity:7763299|Enchanted Forest] south and southeast of here, an ancient tree ent resided who would know exactly where Genovian lived. But the [entity:7763299|Enchanted Forest] contained primal forces that could kill mortalborn through catastrophic exposure to raw natural power.

"I sense something wrong," the dryad confided, her expression troubled in ways that transcended immediate concerns. "I cannot identify the source. The wind tastes the same, the brooks sing as they should, but something fundamental feels... off."

She could test their worthiness to receive protective blessing, but they would need blessings from two other forest guardians as well. Only with all three protective lanterns could they safely traverse the [entity:7763299|Enchanted Forest] to reach the ent. The Wasps' Queen and the Vine Tender each controlled their own territories and trials.

"I'm ready," [entity:7763295|Bruldin] declared with enthusiasm that suggested he viewed tests as entertainment.

---

The dryad raised her hand and the clearing transformed. An awakened tree took form at the center, animated by her will into guardian that would test their worthiness. Above it hovered weird bluish flameless fire—the protective lantern they sought. Three magical hazards materialized: smoke that created concealment and difficult breathing, illusory pixies projecting primal energy, and icy well generating crystalline shields around the tree.

The trial began with the tree hurling clods of dirt with force that belied vegetable composition. One struck [entity:7763290|Arnor] square in the chest—the opening blow establishing this test's lethal nature. Vines erupted from underground to grab [entity:7763295|Bruldin], their restraint proving nearly impossible to escape through pure strength.

[entity:7763294|Aurelia] discovered that the blue flame was illusion while learning the smoke could be counteracted through survival techniques. [entity:7763289|Alrik] observed the tree receiving supernatural protection from the three hazards—disabling them was key, though effects regenerated quickly.

They adapted with creativity that transcended simple combat. [entity:7763289|Alrik] intimidated the illusory pixies, shouting "Get outta here, ya damn pixies!" with authority that made their defenses collapse despite their incorporeal nature. [entity:7763294|Aurelia] used survival skills to extinguish magical fire, discovering the quasi-illusional hazards acted realistically enough that proper firefighting techniques worked.

[entity:7763289|Alrik's] dispel magic temporarily counteracted the icy well, and his fire ray proved devastatingly effective against wooden guardian. Persistent flames licked at ancient bark, the tree unable to move from rooted position that became liability rather than strength.

The turning point came when [entity:7763290|Arnor] cast a spell targeting the tree's will—its weak point. The magic overwhelmed the guardian's defenses completely, fear seizing it while flames consumed accelerating amounts of bark. The combination of [entity:7763294|Aurelia's] devastating arrows, [entity:7763289|Alrik's] spiritual weapon and flame magic, and relentless burning brought the guardian down.

Silence descended as the test concluded, the awakened tree collapsing into ordinary wood while magical hazards dissipated like morning mist.

The [entity:7764101|Willow Dryad] granted them the first protective lantern with ceremony that acknowledged both accomplishment and journey ahead. The weird bluish flameless fire illuminated roughly twenty feet, its light carrying properties beyond simple illumination.

"When all three are gathered," she explained, "anyone within their light receives substantial protection against the [entity:7763299|Enchanted Forest's] primal forces. The lanterns will guard you from the worst of its dangers, allowing safe passage to the ancient ent."

The party accepted the lantern with satisfaction earned through blood and tactical problem-solving. They had proven themselves worthy by forest guardian standards—not merely capable of violence, but adaptable enough to recognize patterns, creative enough to exploit weaknesses, and coordinated enough to execute complex strategies.

As they prepared to leave [entity:7764107|Willow Glade], [entity:7763296|Qotal] studied the leshy-creature's melody, committing its unusual harmonics to memory. The song represented key to calming Genovian's emanations, potentially allowing communication with an Espada who should have departed decades or centuries ago.

Two paths lay before them: seek Genovian directly in the waterfall plateau using the calming melody, or continue guardian trials to gather remaining lanterns before consulting the ancient ent. Both offered answers about the one-eyed creature, about disturbed forest balance, about mysteries accumulating faster than solutions.

The [entity:7764101|Willow Dryad] watched their departure with expression that combined hope and concern. Something remained wrong in the forest, disturbance she sensed without identifying. Whether Genovian's persistent emanations caused it, or merely represented symptom of deeper corruption, remained to be discovered.

They traveled back toward [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing] as afternoon light filtered through the canopy, the weird bluish lantern hanging from [entity:7763295|Bruldin's] pack. The melody of forgotten spirits echoed through [entity:7763296|Qotal's] thoughts—harmonics that connected to forces deeper than mortal understanding, promising answers if only they could decipher the song's true meaning.
