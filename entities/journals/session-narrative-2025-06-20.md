# Chapter 5 - The One-Eyed Witness

Morning light filtered through the mess hall's narrow windows, catching motes of dust that danced above steaming porridge bowls. [entity:7763296|Qotal] spread the party's accumulated treasures across the scarred wooden table, his scaled fingers moving with scholarly precision as he examined each piece.

"The dagger bears old markings," he murmured, turning the blade to catch the light. "Dwarven clan work, with a potency rune of the first order." His eyes, those unsettling orbs that seemed to see more than mere surfaces, narrowed as he studied the remaining items. A wooden box no larger than his palm revealed itself as a missive mint—an alchemical curiosity capable of conveying twenty-five words to whoever consumed it. The leather sheath, unremarkable at first glance, hummed with enchantment designed to conceal light weapons from prying eyes.

[entity:7763294|Aurelia] traced a finger along her cold iron rapier's edge, the metal's dull sheen a constant reminder of her nature. "Four gold to transfer the rune?" She weighed the cost against necessity. "Done. I'll not face another rust ooze with degraded steel."

[entity:7763289|Alrik Grimmelstang] looked up from his breakfast preparations—an alarming process involving medical forceps and what might have been surgical thread. "If we're to investigate these wagons, we must move soon. The wilderness swallows evidence like [entity:7764103|Vidia] swallows sugar water."

The tiny sprite bobbed indignantly around his wild hair but offered no denial.

"Patience," [entity:7763296|Qotal] counseled. "A day's rest while weapons are repaired. The wagons have waited this long—they'll keep another day."

---

The settlement's rhythm during enforced downtime took on a quality both languid and purposeful. [entity:7763296|Qotal] found [entity:7764102|Aelysh] in her tree, surrounded by pressed botanical samples and careful notes. The [entity:7763217|wood elf's] approach to nature studies proved surprisingly methodical—each plant catalogued, cross-referenced, examined through lenses of both science and reverence.

[entity:7763294|Aurelia] sought out [entity:7763693|Sylvia Mournhold], finding the [entity:7763865|Iron Kingdoms] noble practicing bladework in the courtyard. Her rapier moved like liquid silver, each thrust and parry flowing into the next with the precision of someone who'd made swordplay into art. Between bouts, they spoke of distant kingdoms and the weight of family expectations.

[entity:7763290|Arnor's] path led to darker territories. The [entity:7764198|Von Carstein mansion] loomed on its island perch, and within its Gothic walls [entity:7764193|Osanna Von Carstein] held court. The vampire noble received him with amused courtesy, her knowledge of [entity:7763172|Astoria] flowing as freely as the wine she couldn't drink. Her attendant Silas hovered nearby, aspiring to undeath with the dedication of a true believer.

For [entity:7763289|Alrik], the day meant more time in [entity:7764196|Rosencrantz's] laboratory. The mechamagician's enthusiasm for the scientific method matched the chef's own experimental approach to cuisine. Between discussions of gear ratios and flavor profiles, they found unexpected common ground in their mutual disdain for society's meaningless protocols.

That evening, beneath a waning gibbous moon, [entity:7763290|Arnor] led his companions into the woods. The clearing he'd chosen held the quality of sacred space—not through any altar or marking, but through the weight of intention brought to bear upon it.

"This is Natvig," [entity:7763290|the Norn] said as his familiar landed on a nearby branch. The trash griffin fixed its bright eyes on the assembled party, head cocking with unmistakable intelligence. "He acts as my go-between with the spirits from whom I gain my spells."

[entity:7763296|Qotal] tossed a scrap of dried meat toward the creature. [entity:7763867|Natvig] caught it mid-air with a pleased chirp-croak, then settled to watch the proceedings with heightened interest—particularly toward [entity:7763296|the generous monk].

[entity:7763290|Arnor's] voice rose in ancient song, words in the old tongue spiraling up toward the moon's pale face. [entity:7763289|Alrik] lasted perhaps ten minutes before his snores joined the night chorus, while [entity:7763294|Aurelia] remained outside long after the ritual ended, savoring the darkness like wine.

---

The second morning brought urgency with the sunrise. Weapons repaired and runes transferred, the party gathered once more in the mess hall. [entity:7763289|Alrik], having prepared breakfast with implements better suited to surgery than cooking, pushed his plate aside.

"If we are going to investigate this wagon, I think we must do it soon. Perhaps today."

No argument arose. They'd rested, resupplied, and the abandoned wagons called like an itch demanding to be scratched. The dwarven road stretched west from [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing], its stones fitted with the precision of a civilization that built for centuries rather than seasons.

[entity:7763867|Natvig] accompanied them, wheeling overhead for three full miles while casting hopeful glances toward [entity:7763296|Qotal's] pack. The morning air carried hints of rain to come, and beneath it something else—a wrongness that grew stronger as they traveled.

The wagons, when they found them, told a story of violence without victors. Wheels smashed, goods scattered like entrails across the roadside, yet not a single body remained to explain the destruction. [entity:7763295|Bruldin] knelt beside deep gouges in the earth, his scarred fingers tracing patterns that spoke of weight and rage combined.

"Bulvak," he pronounced, the word carrying the weight of recognition. "Demon-touched. They walked upright, but these tracks..." He shook his head. "Nothing natural moves like this."

The tracks led away from the road into forest that grew darker with each step. When human screams echoed through the trees, the party exchanged glances that needed no words. They moved forward, attempting stealth that failed spectacularly when [entity:7763289|Alrik] stepped on what might have been the only dry branch in the entire wood.

The creatures that burst from cover moved wrong—humanoid in shape but beast in motion, clutching spears while making sounds that belonged in no earthly throat. [entity:7763290|Arnor's] needle darts flew true, each one a sliver of focused will that struck with the force of conviction. [entity:7763294|Aurelia's] crossbow sang its own deadly song while [entity:7763296|Qotal] flowed between enemies like water finding its course.

Three bodies later, the screaming continued. These hadn't been the source—merely guards for something worse.

---

The chase that followed tested every skill they'd honed. Through thick forest where branches clutched like desperate fingers, across mist-shrouded swamps where each step might find solid ground or sucking bog. The fey appeared at the worst possible moment, as fey always did, but two displays of athletic prowess convinced them to allow passage without their usual games.

Illusions rose like fever dreams—false paths, phantom enemies, bridges that weren't—but [entity:7763294|Aurelia's] trained eye cut through deception with surgical precision. By the time they burst into the final clearing, lungs burning and muscles screaming protest, they'd gained ground on their quarry.

Gore stood seven feet of corrupted muscle and malevolent intelligence. The bulvak leader's horns swept back from a skull that seemed designed for destruction, and in his massive hands he held rope leads attached to beaten, bloodied humans. Two smaller bulvaks flanked him, their postures speaking of submission to his dominance.

The battle erupted without preamble. [entity:7763290|Arnor's] opening salvo carried cold iron and silver, materials anathema to demon-spawn. [entity:7763294|Aurelia's] crossbow found the sweet spot between Gore's shoulder plates, her critical strike drawing a bellow that shook leaves from trees.

When Gore caught [entity:7763296|Qotal] in his massive hands, the horns following to pierce and hold, it seemed the monk's speed had finally met its match. But [entity:7763296|Qotal] moved like water given purpose, flowing out of the grab to deliver strikes that cracked bone despite the creature's supernatural resilience.

[entity:7763289|Alrik's] maul swung in measured arcs, each impact driving Gore back despite his bulk. When the leader finally fell, one smaller bulvak moved to defend the corpse with touching, if misguided, loyalty. The battle's end came swift and brutal—a blow to the face that left no question of survival.

[entity:7763294|Aurelia] moved among the bodies with practiced efficiency, her feeding disguised as looting. The gems on Gore's body spoke of a different economy—these creatures valued stones over coins, beauty over utility.

"They're following me," [entity:7763289|Alrik] said suddenly, his gaze fixed on the treeline. "They want my recipe."

The one-eyed figure stood motionless between the trees, its single orb glowing with light that belonged to no spectrum of normal sight. When the party's attention focused fully upon it, the entity simply ceased—not fleeing or fading, but absent between one heartbeat and the next.

Before anyone could process this development, new visitors arrived. The fey materialized from nothing, tiny forms with voices like badly-tuned instruments. Their questions made no sense—riddles without answers, queries that folded back upon themselves. But through the babble, one phrase emerged crystal clear:

"It must be Tessa."

Then they too vanished, leaving only confused silence and rescued prisoners who wept with the relief of those who'd accepted death and found reprieve instead.

[entity:7764097|Captain Irka Spritzel] met them at the town's edge, her expression shifting from resignation to surprise as she counted the living guards.

"Good, some of the guards are not dead. That is very good." She produced a purse with the practiced motion of someone who'd paid for both successes and failures. "Forty gold for the rescue. The wagons?"

"Kindling," [entity:7763295|Bruldin] reported. "But the men live."

"Sometimes that's enough." The captain's gaze lingered on each of them, cataloguing injuries and exhaustion. "Rest. There'll be more work tomorrow. There always is."

As they dispersed through the settlement, [entity:7763867|Natvig] landed once more on [entity:7763290|Arnor's] shoulder, casting one last hopeful glance toward [entity:7763296|Qotal]. The monk smiled and tossed a final morsel, which the trash griffin caught with a satisfied chirp-croak.

The afternoon sun beat down on [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing] with the weight of summer's promise. Somewhere in the forest, wagons rotted into memory. Somewhere else, a one-eyed witness kept its vigil. And somewhere, perhaps, someone named Tessa waited for news only the fey understood.

But for now, the guards lived, the gold clinked heavy in their purses, and tomorrow's mysteries could wait their turn. On the frontier, that counted as victory enough.
