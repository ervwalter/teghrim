# Fungal Crisis and Forest Cure

## Session Overview

While half the party attended to other matters, [entity:7763294|Aurelia], [entity:7763290|Arnór], and [entity:7763295|Bruldin] answered an urgent call from [entity:7764102|Aelysh] to investigate a dangerous fungal infection threatening the forest ecosystem. The quest led them through rust-plagued bridges to confront a mind-controlling myconid, resulting in both victory and valuable lessons about frontier dangers.

## Story Developments

The morning of Aestra-Orpheus 13th began with an unexpected visitor to the dining hall. [entity:7764104|Iridessa], still damp from her infamous tea bath incident that had gotten her expelled from the establishment, arrived bearing urgent news. The pink fairy explained that [entity:7764102|Aelysh] desperately needed help - her Leshy familiar had contracted a strange fungal infection after venturing into a nearby cave.

[entity:7764102|The wood elf druid] met the responding party members with visible concern. Multiple woodland creatures were showing disturbing signs of infection, with **weird fungus covering them and growing out of them**. Her familiar's condition had worsened rapidly, and she feared the infection would spread throughout the forest if left unchecked. Despite having researched a potential cure, she needed assistance dealing with the source.

The journey to the cave led across an old rickety bridge spanning a forest ravine. Halfway across, the weathered planks began oozing strange substances. Two **rust oozes** emerged from between the boards, their corrosive forms immediately threatening the party's equipment. Steel weapons proved nearly useless against the creatures, degrading upon contact. [entity:7763290|Arnór], relying on his magical abilities rather than conventional arms, discovered that lightning proved devastatingly effective against the oozes. His electrical assault eventually destroyed both creatures, though not before significant damage to the party's weapons.

The cave itself proved surprisingly small and close to the bridge. Inside, they discovered the infection's source - a **myconid**, its mushroom body sprouting tentacles that pulsed with malevolent energy. [entity:7764102|Aelysh's] Leshy familiar stood unnaturally still alongside several bugs, all with fungus stalks growing from their heads. The mind-controlled creatures attacked in eerie coordination.

The party quickly dispatched the smaller infected bugs while focusing their efforts on the controlling myconid. [entity:7763295|Bruldin], recognizing the creatures' behavior patterns, identified the mushroom creature as the puppet master. During the chaotic melee, fungal spores infiltrated [entity:7763295|the dwarven slayer's] defenses, beginning an infection that spread visibly across his skin.

With the myconid's destruction, its hold over the controlled creatures shattered. The Leshy immediately fled into the forest depths, freed but still infected. [entity:7764102|Aelysh] rushed to [entity:7763295|Bruldin's] side, applying her researched cure with practiced efficiency. The abundance of fungal samples from the defeated creatures provided exactly what she needed to complete her remedy, successfully treating the slayer's infection before it could take hold.

Grateful but apologetic about her limited resources, [entity:7764102|the druid] offered what rewards she could provide. **"Being a druid,"** she explained, she had little conventional wealth. Instead, she presented the party with three mysterious items: a **magical leaf** of unknown properties, an **unidentified scabbard**, and an **unidentified dagger**. The party accepted graciously, planning to have the items identified back at [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing].

## Combat & Challenges

The bridge encounter tested the party's adaptability when conventional weapons proved nearly useless against the rust oozes. The corrosive creatures' immunity to steel forced creative solutions, with [entity:7763290|Arnór's] lightning magic proving the key to victory. The cave battle required tactical thinking to identify and eliminate the controlling myconid while managing multiple mind-controlled opponents, complicated by the risk of fungal infection that ultimately affected [entity:7763295|Bruldin].

## Discoveries & Lore

The fungal infection demonstrated the interconnected dangers of the frontier wilderness, where a single infected creature venturing into the wrong cave could threaten an entire ecosystem. The presence of rust oozes on seemingly abandoned infrastructure suggests that even old bridges and structures harbor unique threats. [entity:7764102|Aelysh's] scientific approach to developing natural cures reveals the practical knowledge druids must cultivate to survive in dangerous territories.

## Quest Updates

- **Fungus Investigation** - Successfully eliminated the myconid source and prevented forest-wide infection spread
- Party's steel weapons require repair after rust ooze encounters
- Three unidentified magical items await identification at [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing]

## Next Steps

The party must arrange for weapon repairs and seek identification for [entity:7764102|Aelysh's] mysterious rewards. The successful resolution of this crisis strengthens their alliance with the local druid, though her Leshy familiar remains at large in the forest. With the 14th of Aestra-Orpheus beginning, new challenges and opportunities await at [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing].
