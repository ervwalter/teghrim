# Into the Necromancer's Lair

## Session Overview

With expert counsel gathered and preparations complete, the party descended into [entity:8051165|Skull Rock] dungeon to confront [entity:7888221|the Jailor] threat. Their expedition beneath the cursed stone formation revealed far more than a simple construct hunt - the tunnels housed a powerful necromancer conducting dark experiments, with [entity:7888221|the Jailor] serving merely as her gatherer of victims.

## Story Developments

The morning of Aestra-Orpheus 28th found the party focused on final preparations before tackling [entity:8051165|Skull Rock]. Following the system outlined by the Dramatis Personae, they invested time strengthening bonds with key allies. [entity:7763296|Qotal] spent his second day with [entity:7764195|Gaz], the [entity:7766459|hob] server at the mess hall, building rapport through pleasant conversation and earning enhanced trust for future interactions. [entity:7763289|Alrik] pursued connection with [entity:7763693|Sylvia Mournhold], learning about her military family background and securing valuable trading benefits - she proved willing to purchase gems and other goods at better prices than typical merchants.

Most significantly, [entity:7763290|Arnor] achieved critical success while training with [entity:7764100|Gierr Bjornson] in archery practice. The older [entity:7763211|Norn] hunter shared insights into his traditional lifestyle - finding pelts for [entity:7764194|Sigrid] to sell, creating scrimshaw carvings from bones, and raising bees for traditional Nornish mead. Impressed by [entity:7763290|Arnor's] skill, [entity:7764100|Gierr] offered the **"Norn Brew"** benefit: before each mission, he would provide a free elixir comparable to the party's level, honoring the [entity:7763211|Norn] tradition of supporting worthy warriors.

During breakfast discussions, several revelations emerged that hinted at broader mysteries. [entity:7763290|Arnor] shared that [entity:7764102|Aelysh's] familiar had discovered a medallion bearing the symbol of **Eris**, goddess of discord and chaos. [entity:7763289|Alrik] identified the deity as a Keeper of Balance alongside [entity:7763137|Pharasma] and [entity:7763165|Tyrael], explaining that her followers - the **Priests of Discord** - worked to prevent any faction from becoming too powerful. The fresh, unworn condition of the medallion suggested active operations in the region.

[entity:7763296|Qotal] recounted the origin of his staff's striking rune, revealing a tale of fey intervention and natural gratitude. [entity:7764104|Iridessa] had asked him to deliver an herb pouch to a deeper grove, where he found a silver fox caught in a snare with its leg badly injured. After freeing and treating the creature, the fox dug up a leather bundle containing the striking rune and presented it as thanks before vanishing. The story prompted [entity:7763289|Alrik] to warn about fey trickery, referencing his own petrification - though [entity:7763296|Qotal] was quick to point out that a basilisk, not fairies, had been responsible for turning both [entity:7763289|Alrik] and [entity:7764103|Vidia] to stone.

[entity:7763866|Lyn Chong] arrived carrying supplies bound for [entity:7764196|Rosencrantz's] laboratory, confirming the collaboration on anti-Jailor weapons using ichor from their previous encounter. The elderly monk expected completion by day's end, timed perfectly with [entity:7763289|Alrik's] weather prediction - clouds would arrive that afternoon and linger, providing the overcast conditions necessary for [entity:7764193|Osanna Von Carstein] to venture out during daylight hours.

Storm clouds moved in overnight as predicted, accompanied by light rain. During his spirit communion, [entity:7763289|Alrik] received an ominous vision from **Skuld**, the [entity:7763211|Norn] deity of future. Ravens flew in an unusually large flock while Skuld chanted, showing a giant winged humanoid woman with raven wings flying toward their direction - described as decidedly **"not a valkyrie"** and carrying dark portent.

## Combat & Challenges

The morning of Aestra-Orpheus 29th arrived with persistent clouds and light rain - perfect conditions for vampire assistance. [entity:7763296|Qotal] prepared four **lesser elixirs of life** using his alchemical skills, distributing basic healing potions among the party. [entity:7763866|Lyn Chong] and [entity:7764196|Rosencrantz] delivered three specialized **anti-Jailor potion bombs**, fine-tuned to confuse the construct's simple logic and create tactical openings. [entity:7763296|Qotal] volunteered to carry the precious bombs, his dexterity making him ideal for ranged throws.

[entity:7764193|Osanna] approached [entity:8051165|the cursed stone formation] with theatrical flair, initially pretending distress before climbing to the pedestal mechanism atop the skull-shaped structure. When she pressed the activation rune, her screams of pain proved genuine - the mechanism violently shocked her, sending her flying through the air to land unconscious. [entity:7763289|Alrik's] medicine check confirmed she had been genuinely dazed, not merely pranking them again. [entity:7763290|Arnor] theorized that deactivating the mechanism released a pulse of positive energy, explaining why it harmed the vampire while simultaneously disabling the necrotic curse field that would have dealt devastating vulnerability damage to living creatures.

Investigation of the mechanism revealed its nature - the rune drew power from very deep sources within the earth, linked to something further down in the dungeon. Simple to deactivate but designed to reset within a day or two, it would become dangerous again quickly. With the field down, an actual door became visible inside the skull formation, leading to a stairway winding downward. The stairs were sized for large creatures, wide enough to accommodate [entity:7888221|the Jailor] or similar beings.

Descending into the tunnels, the party felt oppressive spiritual energy - a malaise that drained at their spirits, suppressing the natural power of the place. The carved halls stretched wide through bedrock, clearly not natural formations nor dwarven construction. Hundreds of tiny rodent skeletons littered the path, identified through [entity:7763296|Qotal's] nature knowledge as rats and mice of various sizes, all dead from causes other than the necrotic field above.

Movement from ceiling holes revealed the first guardians - **spider snakes** that descended on silk threads to strike with venomous fangs. Three of the creatures attacked in coordinated fashion, using hit-and-run tactics as they dropped, struck, and attempted to pull back into ceiling holes. The larger red spider snake's thread snapped, forcing it into sustained melee where it proved most dangerous. [entity:7763296|Qotal] suffered critical failure on his fortitude save, taking severe ongoing poison damage, while the creatures' relentless attacks eventually brought down both [entity:7763289|Alrik] and [entity:7763290|Arnor]. [entity:7763290|Arnor's] **electric arc** spells proved devastatingly effective, with critical failures from the smaller creatures doubling damage and eliminating them swiftly. The red spider snake fought desperately, landing a critical hit on [entity:7763290|Arnor] for massive damage before [entity:7763289|Alrik's] **needle darts** finally pierced its eyes in dramatic finish.

A hidden stone door discovered in an adjacent chamber proved completely non-functional - carved decoration rather than actual passage, with no locking mechanism and no active magic detected by [entity:7763290|Arnor's] divinations. Even [entity:7763290|Arnor's] attempt to force through the wall accomplished nothing against the solid stone. The mystery remained unsolved as the party pressed onward.

The large bone chamber presented an unsettling sight - a massive pile of bones covering the floor with a raised platform and extra-wide door at the far end. As the party entered, loud squeaking erupted as **giant diseased rats** emerged from the bone pile in waves. The creatures proved numerous but fragile, with [entity:7763295|Bruldin] obliterating one with a single blow that left only a small stain. [entity:7763296|Qotal], angered after contracting disease from a rat bite (critical failure giving him **Clumsy 1** indefinitely), brutally destroyed the creature responsible and vented his fury on additional targets. [entity:7763289|Alrik's] **needle darts** sent one rat flying to stick against the wall, while [entity:7763290|Arnor's] sonic magic weakened multiple creatures. The combat ended swiftly, but [entity:7763296|Qotal] recognized he would need [entity:7764102|Aelysh's] disease-curing abilities to remove the affliction.

## Discoveries & Lore

The dungeon's construction revealed deliberate design for housing large creatures, with tunnels carved through bedrock rather than following natural formations. The architecture differed fundamentally from dwarven stonework, suggesting whoever created these passages possessed different construction philosophies and priorities. The absence of any light sources confirmed the inhabitants required no illumination, operating in complete darkness.

The necrotic curse field mechanism proved more sophisticated than initially apparent. Rather than simply harmful magic, it functioned as an active security system drawing power from deep underground sources and linked to something further within the dungeon complex. The positive energy pulse released during deactivation suggested deliberate design to harm undead intruders who might attempt to disable it, an ironic security measure given the necromantic nature of the lair's true master.

The hundreds of dead rodents throughout the tunnels told a story of ecosystem collapse. With no moisture for clear tracks and minimal evidence on the bedrock floors, [entity:7763296|Qotal] and [entity:7763295|Bruldin's] survival checks could determine little about what killed the creatures. The necrotic field above couldn't have been responsible, suggesting something else within the dungeon had eliminated the vermin - perhaps to prevent interference with the necromancer's work or as side effect of darker experiments.

The spider snakes' presence indicated natural infiltration through ceiling holes that connected to external areas. Their funnel webs contained dead bugs, small rats, and desiccated bodies - evidence they had established territory before the necromancer's arrival or found the dungeon's corruption conducive to their hunting grounds. The fact that their tunnel dead-ended rather than connecting to areas behind the mysterious stone door suggested multiple sealed sections throughout the complex.

## Next Steps

The session ended with the party standing in the bone chamber as a powerful figure emerged from deeper within - a large, tall creature with no visible eyes and horns covering her head, wearing a grotesque cloak fashioned from flayed skins of various creatures. Speaking first in **Necral** before switching to Common, she expressed irritation at their intrusion past her security measures and offered them one chance to explain how they entered - promising slow, agonizing death if they refused. [entity:7763289|Alrik's] sarcastic response about being the "neighborhood welcoming committee" prompted her cold dismissal. With a simple command to **"Arise,"** she raised a skeleton army from the bone pile, ordering them to bring the party to her alive before retreating toward the inner chambers. The party now faces immediate combat against multiple skeleton warriors including one particularly large specimen, with the necromancer's true nature and connection to [entity:7888221|the Jailor] still unclear. [entity:7764193|Osanna] remains unconscious outside the dungeon entrance, while [entity:7763296|Qotal] carries their only specialized weapons against the construct they came to destroy. The necromancer's slip - saying "we" before correcting to "I" - suggests she may not work alone, hinting at broader conspiracies operating beneath [entity:8051165|the cursed stone formation].
