# Into the Necromancer's Lair

## Session Overview

With expert counsel gathered and preparations complete, the party descended into [entity:8051165|Skull Rock] dungeon to confront [entity:7888221|the Jailor] threat. Their expedition beneath the cursed stone formation revealed far more than a simple construct hunt - the tunnels housed a powerful necromancer conducting dark experiments, with [entity:7888221|the Jailor] serving merely as her gatherer of victims.

## Story Developments

The morning of Aestra-Orpheus 28th found the party making final preparations before tackling [entity:8051165|Skull Rock]. [entity:7763296|Qotal] strengthened his bond with [entity:7764195|Gaz], the [entity:7766459|hob] server at the mess hall, while [entity:7763289|Alrik] befriended [entity:7763693|Sylvia Mournhold], earning valuable trading benefits. Most significantly, [entity:7763290|Arnor's] archery training with [entity:7764100|Gierr Bjornson] impressed the older [entity:7763211|Norn] hunter enough to earn the **Norn Brew** benefit - free elixirs before each mission, honoring the tradition of supporting worthy warriors.

During breakfast discussions, [entity:7763290|Arnor] shared that [entity:7764102|Aelysh's] familiar had discovered a medallion bearing the symbol of **Eris**, goddess of discord. [entity:7763289|Alrik] identified her followers as **Priests of Discord** who worked to prevent any faction from becoming too powerful. The fresh condition of the medallion suggested active operations in the region.

[entity:7763296|Qotal] recounted finding a silver fox caught in a snare during an errand for [entity:7764104|Iridessa]. After freeing and treating the injured creature, it dug up a striking rune and presented it as thanks before vanishing - a tale of fey gratitude that prompted [entity:7763289|Alrik's] warnings about fairy trickery.

[entity:7763866|Lyn Chong] arrived with news that [entity:7764196|Rosencrantz] had completed three specialized **anti-Jailor bombs** using ichor from their previous encounter. The timing proved perfect - [entity:7763289|Alrik's] weather prediction came true as storm clouds moved in, providing the overcast conditions necessary for [entity:7764193|Osanna Von Carstein] to venture out during daylight.

During his spirit communion, [entity:7763289|Alrik] received an ominous vision from **Skuld**, the [entity:7763211|Norn] deity of future. Ravens flew in an unusually large flock while she showed a giant winged woman with raven wings flying toward their direction - decidedly **"not a valkyrie"** and carrying dark portent.

## Combat & Challenges

On the morning of Aestra-Orpheus 29th, [entity:7764193|Osanna] approached [entity:8051165|the cursed stone formation] with theatrical flair before climbing to deactivate the pedestal mechanism atop the skull. When she pressed the activation rune, her screams proved genuine - the mechanism shocked her violently, sending her flying unconscious. [entity:7763290|Arnor] theorized the deactivation released positive energy, explaining why it harmed the vampire while disabling the necrotic curse field that protected the entrance.

With the field down, a doorway appeared leading to stairs carved for large creatures. Descending into oppressive darkness, the party felt spiritual malaise draining their energy. The wide tunnels stretched through bedrock - clearly not natural formations nor dwarven work. Hundreds of tiny rodent skeletons littered the path.

**Spider snakes** descended from ceiling holes on silk threads, striking with venomous fangs before attempting to retreat. The creatures used hit-and-run tactics, with the largest proving particularly dangerous after its thread snapped. [entity:7763296|Qotal] suffered severe poisoning, while the relentless attacks eventually felled both [entity:7763289|Alrik] and [entity:7763290|Arnor]. [entity:7763290|Arnor's] lightning magic proved devastatingly effective before [entity:7763289|Alrik's] needle darts finished the largest creature.

The bone chamber presented a massive pile of skeletal remains with a raised platform and extra-wide door beyond. **Giant diseased rats** emerged in waves, numerous but fragile. [entity:7763296|Qotal] contracted disease from a bite, leaving him afflicted until [entity:7764102|Aelysh] could treat him. The party dispatched the creatures quickly before pressing deeper into the dungeon.

## Discoveries & Lore

The dungeon's construction revealed deliberate design for housing large creatures, carved through bedrock in a style fundamentally different from dwarven stonework. The absence of light sources confirmed the inhabitants required no illumination, operating in complete darkness.

The necrotic curse field mechanism proved more sophisticated than expected - an active security system drawing power from deep underground sources. The positive energy pulse released during deactivation suggested deliberate design to harm undead intruders, an ironic security measure given the necromantic nature of the lair's true master.

Hundreds of dead rodents throughout the tunnels told a story of ecosystem collapse. The necrotic field above couldn't have killed them, suggesting something else within the dungeon had eliminated the vermin - perhaps to prevent interference with dark experiments. The spider snakes' presence indicated natural infiltration through ceiling holes, their webs containing evidence they'd established territory before the necromancer's arrival.

## Quest Updates

- **[entity:8244511|Skull Rock Dungeon Expedition]** - Successfully infiltrated dungeon with vampire assistance and fought through initial guardians
- **Dramatis Personae Relationships** - [entity:7763296|Qotal] strengthened bond with [entity:7764195|Gaz], [entity:7763289|Alrik] befriended [entity:7763693|Sylvia Mournhold] for trading benefits, [entity:7763290|Arnor] earned [entity:7764100|Gierr's] Norn Brew support
- **Priests of Discord Investigation** - Emerging mystery: fresh **Eris** medallion suggests active operations in the region

## Next Steps

As the party stood in the bone chamber, a powerful figure emerged from deeper within - a tall creature with no visible eyes and horns covering her head, wearing a grotesque cloak of flayed skins. Speaking first in **Necral** before switching to Common, she expressed irritation at their intrusion and offered one chance to explain how they entered, promising slow death if they refused.

[entity:7763289|Alrik's] sarcastic response about being the "neighborhood welcoming committee" prompted her cold dismissal. With a simple command to **"Arise,"** she raised skeleton warriors from the bone pile, ordering them to bring the party alive before retreating to her inner chambers. The party now faces immediate combat with the necromancer's true nature and connection to [entity:7888221|the Jailor] still unclear. [entity:7764193|Osanna] remains unconscious outside while [entity:7763296|Qotal] carries their specialized anti-Jailor bombs. The necromancer's slip - saying "we" before correcting to "I" - suggests she may not work alone.
