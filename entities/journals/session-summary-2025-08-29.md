# The Fleshcrafter's Domain

## Session Overview

The party descended deeper into [entity:8051165|Skull Rock] dungeon, confronting wave after wave of undead horrors as they pushed toward the necromancer controlling the lair. Through four grueling combat encounters without rest, they destroyed skeleton warriors, defeated [entity:7888221|the Jailor] construct, survived a meat puppet ambush, and confronted the Fleshcrafter herself—though she ultimately escaped through a hidden passage, leaving her secrets scattered throughout her abandoned laboratory.

## Story Developments

The session began with the party trapped in the bone chamber as the necromancer raised skeleton warriors from the scattered remains, commanding them to capture the intruders alive. The creatures wielded glaives with deadly reach, but [entity:7763295|Bruldin's] maul strikes and [entity:7763296|Qotal's] precise staff work made short work of the undead guardians. [entity:7763290|Arnor's] **electric arc** spells proved less effective against bone, while [entity:7763289|Alrik's] sanctified spirit damage struck true. The oppressive spiritual atmosphere made rest impossible, with bones shambling periodically and rats creeping from crevices.

Beyond the bone chamber lay a massive jail cell area sized for huge creatures, and there stood [entity:7888221|the Jailor] itself—the very construct they had come to destroy. Empty cages lined the walls, their prisoners long since delivered to the necromancer's dark purposes. The construct gestured toward the cells, then to the party, gripping its whip in clear demand for surrender. Instead, [entity:7763296|Qotal] deployed one of the specialized **anti-Jailor bombs** crafted by [entity:7764196|Rosencrantz] and [entity:7763866|Lyn Chong] from the creature's own ichor. The alchemical weapon struck true, causing the construct's movements to slow dramatically.

The battle tested every tactical skill the party possessed. [entity:7888221|The Jailor] launched chunks of its own rotting flesh as projectiles, its putrid aura causing wounds to fester. When it attempted a devastating spray attack, fortune smiled upon the party—the construct's aim failed spectacularly, flinging noxious filth harmlessly past its targets. [entity:7763295|Bruldin's] intimidating strikes frightened the massive construct, while [entity:7763290|Arnor's] fire magic slowly burned away at its undead flesh. As [entity:7888221|the Jailor] attempted to retreat, [entity:7763296|Qotal] seized the opportunity, delivering a devastating blow that shattered the bone cage chest cavity and brought the towering horror crashing down.

Investigation revealed only empty cages—all prisoners already processed. Another mysterious sealed stone door marked the chamber, its faded magic offering no clues. The narrow hallway beyond led to a ritual chamber dominated by a swirling portal of dark energy. Chains hung around the otherworldly gateway while bookshelves and workbenches lined the walls. [entity:7763295|Bruldin] shuddered at the overwhelming evil permeating the space.

As the party entered, **meat puppets** erupted from hiding among the shelves. The grotesque constructs of stitched smooth leather writhed and attacked, leaping high to strike casters, vomiting maggot-infested poison, and exploding in sprays of gore when destroyed. The extended battle drained resources heavily as the constructs used hit-and-run tactics and coordinated flanking. [entity:7763295|Bruldin's] **risky surgery** provided crucial healing despite initial damage, while [entity:7763290|Arnor's] **electric arc** proved devastatingly effective against these creatures.

After a desperate rest period fending off spawning vermin, they pressed deeper. The final chamber revealed the full horror of the Fleshcrafter's operations. The necromancer herself stood wearing her grotesque cloak of flayed skins—the very flesh stripped from [entity:7888221|the Jailor's] victims. Around her shuffled the fleshless corpses of those same people, animated as undead troops.

The Fleshcrafter expressed irritation at the party's success in defeating her "gatherer," threatening to vivisect them to discover how they had become so skilled. She reached toward a **soul orb** anchored in her chamber, drawing necromantic power to unleash negative energy that left most of the party stupefied. [entity:7763290|Arnor] countered with **Lose Time's Arrow**, granting extra movement, while [entity:7763295|Bruldin] revealed crucial intelligence about the troops' weakness to area attacks.

The battle raged as the undead troops surrounded the party with their **shambling onslaught**. [entity:7763289|Alrik] observed the Fleshcrafter's pattern of drawing power from the soul orb and recognized an opportunity. He readied **Dispel Magic** to disrupt her next attempt. When the necromancer reached for the orb again, [entity:7763289|Alrik's] spell succeeded brilliantly, reversing the orb's polarity to channel positive energy instead of negative. The Fleshcrafter shrieked in pain at the unexpected backlash and stumbled backward through a door, fleeing deeper into the complex before the party could stop her. Without their commander, the remaining undead troops fell quickly to concentrated attacks.

## Combat & Challenges

The marathon of four consecutive encounters tested the party's endurance and resource management. Skeleton warriors with reach weapons forced careful positioning, while [entity:7888221|the Jailor] battle demonstrated the value of preparation—the anti-Jailor bombs significantly weakened the construct, and a fortunate miss on its devastating spray attack prevented potential disaster.

The meat puppet ambush created a prolonged war of attrition. The creatures' explosive deaths, bouncing attacks, and maggot poison drained resources heavily. [entity:7763295|Bruldin's] risky surgery technique proved vital, accepting initial damage for the chance at enhanced healing.

The final confrontation with the Fleshcrafter introduced **troop** mechanics—enemies requiring area attacks or slashing damage for maximum efficiency. The necromancer's negative energy pulses reduced spell effectiveness, while the troops threatened to overwhelm through persistence. [entity:7763289|Alrik's] dispel success proved decisive, reversing the soul orb's polarity and forcing the Fleshcrafter to retreat rather than fight to the death.

## Discoveries & Lore

Investigation of [entity:7888221|the Jailor's] empty cages revealed the grim truth—all captured victims had been delivered to the Fleshcrafter before the party's arrival. The undead troops fighting alongside the necromancer were those very victims, their skins stripped to create her macabre cloaks while their fleshless bodies served as mindless soldiers.

The soul orb in the ritual chamber functions as an anchored power generator, drawing negative energy from deep sources to fuel necromantic magic. The orb cannot be moved but can be reversed to channel positive energy instead—a vulnerability [entity:7763289|Alrik] exploited to force the Fleshcrafter's retreat.

After the necromancer's escape, the party discovered her personal quarters on an upper level, featuring furniture sized for her considerable height and alcoves filled with tomes and magic items. A glowing **pentagram** marked the floor—potentially a summoning or teleportation circle. The entire lair radiated such powerful curse energy that the party could only safely spend limited time investigating before suffering negative effects.

[entity:7763296|Qotal] examined a massive **stone tome** made of rock itself and collected correspondence written in **Necral** that none of them could read—[entity:7763294|Aurelia], absent from this expedition, likely speaks the language. [entity:7763289|Alrik] investigated the spiritual environment and analyzed the soul pool's properties. [entity:7763290|Arnor] studied the magic tomes and examined the pentagram circle.

Multiple sealed stone doors throughout the complex remain mysterious, showing only faded magic with no apparent opening mechanisms. Their purpose awaits future investigation.

## Quest Updates

- **[entity:8244511|Skull Rock Dungeon Expedition]** - Primary objective achieved: [entity:7888221|the Jailor] has been destroyed, eliminating the immediate threat to the region. Dungeon cleared of all active undead forces. However, the Fleshcrafter escaped through a hidden passage, her whereabouts unknown and her operations unresolved.
- **Disease Treatment** - [entity:7763296|Qotal] still suffers from **Clumsy 1** condition contracted from diseased rats, requiring [entity:7764102|Aelysh's] healing abilities to cure.
- **Translation Required** - Necral correspondence collected from the Fleshcrafter's quarters contains unknown intelligence about her operations and potential connections to broader threats.
- **Research Materials** - Stone tome, magic tomes, and various items discovered during investigation await full analysis.
- **Sealed Doors Mystery** - Multiple mysterious stone doors with faded magic throughout the dungeon remain unexplored and unexplained.

## Next Steps

With [entity:7888221|the Jailor] destroyed and the immediate undead threat eliminated, the party has achieved their primary objective. However, the Fleshcrafter's escape leaves critical questions unanswered. The correspondence in Necral likely holds crucial intelligence once [entity:7763294|Aurelia] returns to translate it. The party must deal with [entity:7763296|Qotal's] lingering disease, return to [entity:7764193|Osanna Von Carstein] who remains unconscious outside the dungeon entrance, and report their findings to [entity:7764097|Captain Irka] at [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing]. The stone tomes, magic items, and research materials may reveal the Fleshcrafter's true goals and connections to larger threats. The sealed stone doors throughout [entity:8051165|Skull Rock] represent another lingering mystery, their purpose still unknown despite the party's victory.
