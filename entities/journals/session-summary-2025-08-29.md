# The Fleshcrafter's Domain

## Session Overview

The party descended deeper into [entity:8051165|Skull Rock] dungeon, confronting wave after wave of undead horrors as they pushed toward the necromancer controlling the lair. Through four grueling combat encounters without rest, they destroyed skeleton warriors, defeated [entity:7888221|the Jailor] construct, survived a meat puppet ambush, and confronted the Fleshcrafter herself—though she ultimately escaped through a hidden passage, leaving her secrets scattered throughout her abandoned laboratory.

## Story Developments

The session began with the party trapped in the bone chamber as the necromancer raised five skeleton warriors from the scattered remains, commanding them to capture the intruders alive. The creatures wielded glaives with deadly reach, but [entity:7763295|Bruldin's] devastating maul strikes and [entity:7763296|Qotal's] precise staff work made short work of the undead guardians. [entity:7763290|Arnor's] **electric arc** spells proved less effective due to the skeletons' resistance to electricity, while [entity:7763289|Alrik's] sanctified spirit damage struck true against their animated bones. The oppressive spiritual atmosphere of the chamber made rest impossible, with bones shambling periodically and rats creeping from crevices in the walls.

Beyond the bone chamber lay a massive jail cell area sized for huge creatures, and there stood [entity:7888221|the Jailor] itself—the very construct they had come to destroy. The empty cages lining the walls and vacant bone cage in its chest told a grim story: all prisoners had already been delivered to the necromancer for her dark purposes. The construct gestured toward the cells, then to the party, gripping its whip in clear demand for surrender. Instead, [entity:7763296|Qotal] deployed one of the specialized **anti-Jailor bombs** crafted by [entity:7764196|Rosencrantz] and [entity:7763866|Lyn Chong] from the creature's own ichor. The alchemical weapon struck true, causing the construct to groan as its movements slowed and its combat stance faltered.

The battle that followed tested every tactical skill the party possessed. [entity:7888221|The Jailor] launched chunks of its own rotting flesh as projectiles, its putrid aura causing wounds to fester on any already injured. When it attempted to spray offal across all nearby combatants in a devastating area attack, fortune smiled upon the party—the construct rolled a critical failure, flinging the noxious filth harmlessly past its targets. [entity:7763295|Bruldin] struck with an intimidating critical hit that frightened the massive construct, while [entity:7763290|Arnor's] persistent fire spell slowly burned away at its undead flesh. As [entity:7888221|the Jailor] attempted to retreat, [entity:7763296|Qotal] seized the opportunity for an attack, landing a critical strike that shattered enough of the bone cage chest cavity to bring the towering horror crashing down.

Investigation of the jail cells revealed only empty cages and the keys to open them—all cells already stood open, their prisoners long since processed. Another of the mysterious sealed stone doors marked the chamber, its faded magic offering no clues to its purpose. The narrow hallway beyond led to a larger ritual chamber dominated by a swirling portal of dark energy. Chains hung around the otherworldly gateway while bookshelves and workbenches lined the walls, restricting movement around the room's perimeter. [entity:7763295|Bruldin's] sanctified nature caused him to shudder at the overwhelming evil permeating the space.

As the party entered, nine **meat puppets** erupted from their hiding places among the shelves and workbenches. The grotesque constructs of stitched smooth leather writhed and wriggled, their shiny black eyes fixed on the intruders as they attacked from all directions. The creatures demonstrated horrifying abilities—leaping ten feet high to strike casters in the rear line, vomiting maggot-infested poison slime that burrowed deeper into existing wounds, and exploding in sprays of gore when destroyed. The extended battle lasted nearly ten rounds as the constructs used hit-and-run tactics, bouncing away after attacks and coordinating flanking positions. [entity:7763295|Bruldin] provided crucial healing when he performed **risky surgery** on [entity:7763296|Qotal], dealing damage first but then achieving a critical success that restored substantial health. [entity:7763290|Arnor's] **electric arc** proved devastatingly effective against these creatures, exploiting their vulnerability to lightning damage.

After a desperate thirty-minute rest during which [entity:7763296|Qotal] treated [entity:7763290|Arnor's] wounds and the party recovered their stamina while fending off spawning rats and spiders, they pressed deeper into the complex. The final chamber revealed the full horror of the Fleshcrafter's operations. The necromancer herself stood before them wearing her grotesque cloak of flayed skins—the very flesh stripped from victims delivered by [entity:7888221|the Jailor]. Around her shuffled the fleshless corpses of those same victims, animated as walker and crawler troops that created difficult terrain wherever they shambled.

The Fleshcrafter expressed irritation at the party's success in defeating her "gatherer" and bypassing her security, threatening to vivisect them to discover how they had become so skilled. When [entity:7763295|Bruldin] admitted he didn't understand the word "vivisect," the party deflected with humor about being "local neighborhood tax assessors." The necromancer was not amused. She reached toward a **soul orb** anchored in her chamber, drawing necromantic power to unleash a pulse of negative energy that left most of the party stupefied. [entity:7763290|Arnor] countered with **Lose Time's Arrow**, granting the party extra movement, while [entity:7763295|Bruldin] revealed crucial intelligence: the troop-type enemies were weak to area-of-effect attacks.

The battle raged as the undead troops surrounded the party, using their **shambling onslaught** abilities to pummel everyone within reach. [entity:7763295|Bruldin] delivered a devastating critical hit for fifty points of damage against the troops, while [entity:7763289|Alrik] observed the Fleshcrafter's pattern of drawing power from the soul orb. Recognizing an opportunity, he readied **Dispel Magic** to disrupt her next attempt. When the necromancer reached for the orb again, [entity:7763289|Alrik] released his spell and rolled a natural twenty on the dispel attempt. The magic reversed the orb's polarity, forcing it to channel positive energy instead of negative. The Fleshcrafter shrieked in pain at the unexpected backlash and stumbled backward through a door, fleeing deeper into the complex before the party could stop her. Without their commander, the remaining undead troops fell quickly to concentrated attacks, with slashing damage proving particularly effective at cutting through the masses.

## Combat & Challenges

The skeleton warriors' reach weapons created tactical challenges from multiple elevations, but proper positioning and concentrated damage eliminated them in approximately three rounds. [entity:7763295|Bruldin's] intimidating strike and [entity:7763296|Qotal's] finishing blow both scored critical hits that shattered bones spectacularly.

[entity:7888221|The Jailor] battle demonstrated the value of preparation and fortune. The anti-Jailor bombs significantly weakened the construct, slowing its attacks and reducing its combat effectiveness. The creature's critical failure on its offal spray attack—which would have dealt massive damage to all nearby party members plus ongoing area damage—prevented what could have been a devastating setback. The party's advancement to fourth level provided crucial survivability through the stamina point system.

The meat puppet ambush tested the party's endurance through eight to ten rounds of sustained combat. The creatures' explosive deaths, bouncing attacks, and maggot poison created a war of attrition that drained resources heavily. [entity:7763296|Qotal] suffered repeated failures on grapple attempts, burning a hero point only to roll even worse. [entity:7763295|Bruldin's] risky surgery technique proved vital, accepting initial damage for the chance at enhanced healing that ultimately proved successful.

The final confrontation with the Fleshcrafter revealed the party's first encounter with **troop** mechanics—enemies that share a single hit point pool and require area-of-effect or slashing damage for maximum efficiency. The stupefied conditions from the necromancer's negative energy pulses reduced spell effectiveness, while the troops' shambling onslaught attacks threatened to overwhelm through sheer persistence. [entity:7763289|Alrik's] critical success on the dispel attempt proved decisive, forcing the boss to retreat rather than fight to the death.

## Discoveries & Lore

Investigation of [entity:7888221|the Jailor's] empty cages revealed the grim truth—all captured victims had been delivered to the Fleshcrafter before the party's arrival. The walker and crawler undead troops fighting alongside the necromancer were those very victims, their skins stripped to create her macabre cloaks while their fleshless bodies served as mindless soldiers.

The soul orb in the ritual chamber functions as an anchored power generator, drawing negative energy from deep sources to fuel necromantic magic. The orb cannot be moved but can be reversed to channel positive energy instead—a vulnerability [entity:7763289|Alrik] exploited to force the Fleshcrafter's retreat. The party recognized they could have attempted to destroy it or strike it during combat, though they lacked the specific knowledge to safely utilize its power themselves.

After the Fleshcrafter's escape, the party discovered her personal quarters on an upper level, featuring a large bed, furniture sized for her considerable height, and alcoves filled with tomes and magic items. A glowing **pentagram** marked the floor—potentially a summoning or teleportation circle. The entire lair radiated such powerful curse energy that the party realized they could only safely spend thirty minutes investigating before suffering increasingly severe negative effects.

The party conducted three ten-minute exploration rounds with [entity:7763295|Bruldin] defending during the latter attempts to provide bonuses to others' investigation checks. [entity:7763296|Qotal] examined a massive **stone tome** made of rock itself, studied the flayed corpses with his medical knowledge, and collected correspondence written in **Necral** that none of them could read. [entity:7763289|Alrik] investigated the spiritual environment of the cursed location and successfully analyzed the soul pool's properties using his religious knowledge. [entity:7763290|Arnor] studied the magic tomes in the alcoves and examined the pentagram circle. [entity:7763295|Bruldin] investigated the trash heap near the jail cells. The party recognized that [entity:7763294|Aurelia], absent from this expedition, likely speaks Necral and could translate the correspondence.

Multiple sealed stone doors throughout the complex remain mysterious. These doors show only faded magic when examined, with no active enchantments and no apparent opening mechanisms. Their purpose and what they might contain await future investigation.

## Quest Updates

- **[entity:8244511|Skull Rock Dungeon Expedition]** - Primary objective achieved: [entity:7888221|the Jailor] has been destroyed, eliminating the immediate threat to the region. Dungeon cleared of all active undead forces. However, the Fleshcrafter escaped through a hidden passage, her whereabouts unknown and her operations unresolved.
- **Disease Treatment** - [entity:7763296|Qotal] still suffers from **Clumsy 1** condition contracted from diseased rats, requiring [entity:7764102|Aelysh's] healing abilities to cure.
- **Translation Required** - Necral correspondence collected from the Fleshcrafter's quarters contains unknown intelligence about her operations and potential connections to broader threats.
- **Research Materials** - Stone tome, magic tomes, and various items discovered during investigation await full analysis.
- **Sealed Doors Mystery** - Multiple mysterious stone doors with faded magic throughout the dungeon remain unexplored and unexplained.

## Next Steps

With [entity:7888221|the Jailor] destroyed and the immediate undead threat eliminated, the party has achieved their primary objective of neutralizing the danger to [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing] and the surrounding region. However, the Fleshcrafter's escape through her secret passage leaves critical questions unanswered. Where has she fled? Will she establish new operations elsewhere? What fate befell all the victims delivered by [entity:7888221|the Jailor] before their arrival? The correspondence in Necral likely holds crucial intelligence once [entity:7763294|Aurelia] returns to translate it. The party must also deal with [entity:7763296|Qotal's] lingering disease, return to [entity:7764193|Osanna Von Carstein] who remains unconscious outside the dungeon entrance, and report their findings to [entity:7764097|Captain Irka] and other allies at [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing]. The stone tomes, magic items, and research materials collected during their investigation may reveal the Fleshcrafter's true goals and connections to larger threats facing the region. The sealed stone doors throughout [entity:8051165|Skull Rock] represent another lingering mystery, their purpose and contents still unknown despite the party's victory over the dungeon's master.
