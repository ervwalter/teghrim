# Guardians of the Highland Falls

## Session Overview

With the [entity:8051165|Cursed Stone Formation] discovered and [entity:7763294|Aurelia's] vampiric heritage revealed, the party sought expert counsel about the looming [entity:7888221|Jailor] threat before exploring the mysterious waterfall region. Their consultations with key allies led to valuable insights about defeating constructs, while their journey to the **highland plateau** revealed ancient hob lore about giant guardians and culminated in dangerous encounters with corrupted spirits and highland marsh creatures.

## Story Developments

The morning found the party grappling with the urgent [entity:7888221|Jailor] threat and an incoming caravan's safety. Recognizing their current limitations, they split up to consult various experts at [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing]. [entity:7763296|Qotal] spent time with [entity:7764102|Aelysh], learning about herbalism and nature skills while discovering her **"Nature's Rest"** ability to aid disease recovery. [entity:7763289|Alrik] worked with [entity:7763866|Lyn Chong] on temple construction, earning the elderly monk's friendship and learning about his **"Divine Rest"** ability for curse recovery. Most significantly, [entity:7763290|Arnor] deepened his relationship with [entity:7764193|Osanna Von Carstein], discovering her hidden interest in occultism and gaining crucial intelligence about the Jailor's nature.

[entity:7764193|Osanna] proved exceptionally knowledgeable about constructs and undead-construct hybrids, suggesting [entity:7888221|the Jailor] was likely bound to a controlling entity. Her offer to help destroy the necrotic force field sigil during cloudy conditions provided the party with a potential solution to their most pressing challenge. Meanwhile, [entity:7763295|Bruldin] trained with [entity:7764097|Captain Irka] in dwarven defender techniques, and [entity:7764196|Rosencrantz] offered to create alchemical devices that could generate positive energy to temporarily stun the massive construct.

A disturbing vision came to [entity:7763289|Alrik] during his communion with spirits. **Skuld**, the [entity:7763211|Norn] deity of future, showed him a giant winged humanoid woman with raven wings flying toward their direction - described as ominous and **"not a good thing."** This supernatural warning added another layer of concern to their already dangerous situation.

The party's exploration mission took them via river transport with [entity:7764195|Gaz] to the northern waterfall region, where they would encounter two rival [entity:7766459|hob] rulers leading separate settlements. [entity:7764197|Queen Zelinda] proved to be an elaborate character collector, reveling in formal titles and courtly behavior. Her extensive collection of protective charms and artifacts reflected deep involvement in supernatural defenses. Through careful diplomatic approach and the bestowal of impressive titles including **"Queen of the Starry River"** and **"Divine Mistress and Guardian of the River Wild,"** the party earned her trust and vital information about the **giant guardian**.

[entity:8051161|King Jareth], the Goblin King ruling the settlement on the opposite side of the river from [entity:7764197|Queen Zelinda], presented a more traditionally regal bearing with actual crown and throne room. His knowledge proved invaluable, revealing that multiple giant guardians existed throughout the region, all connected to an entity that hobs offered tribute to. His warning that **"those with evil in the hearts must pay the price"** suggested the guardians served as supernatural sentinels. Most crucially, he directed them northwest toward the statue they sought, past a cursed **Duergar lodge** in the lake region.

## Combat & Challenges

The waterfall exploration presented both natural and supernatural challenges. Navigating the rocky, rain-slicked terrain required careful Athletics and Acrobatics checks, while the massive waterfall itself was guarded by [entity:8051159|Grogug] the Troll. The gregarious but mercenary troll demanded toll for passage, but accepted a special cake from **Mendel** (provided by [entity:7764197|Queen Zelinda] who warned them about [entity:8051159|Grogug]) instead of his usual gold fee or "one person as a meal." [entity:8051159|Grogug] proved surprisingly amenable to the cake offering, granting free passage up the dangerous stone stairs carved into the cliff face while switching between **Jotun** and Common with dark humor about eating travelers.

The **One-Eyed Figure** that had been observing the party for sessions finally confronted them directly. Transforming from mist into a raven-like shadow creature with a single glowing eye, it proved to be a corrupted nature spirit resistant to most damage except cold iron. [entity:7763296|Qotal's] knowledge identified its nature, while [entity:7763290|Arnor's] **Concordant Choir** provided sustained sonic damage. The creature's ability to transform between mist and solid forms created tactical challenges, but the party's cold iron weapons ultimately proved decisive in destroying the corrupted entity.

The highland plateau above the waterfall harbored its own dangers in the form of a complex multi-sided battle. Giant frogs with fifteen-foot tongue reach, giant flies, and beetle-like bugs created a chaotic melee where creatures fought each other as much as the party. [entity:7763296|Qotal] found himself grabbed and pulled by a frog's tongue, while [entity:7763290|Arnor's] area spells proved highly effective against the grouped enemies. The party's tactical positioning allowed them to exploit the creature infighting, conserving resources while gradually eliminating all threats.

## Discoveries & Lore

The consultations revealed crucial intelligence about supernatural threats and defenses. [entity:7764193|Osanna's] insights into construct binding suggested [entity:7888221|the Jailor] served a controlling master, while her occult interests - kept secret from other vampires - opened new avenues for cooperation. The discovery that she could potentially help destroy the necrotic sigil during cloudy conditions provided hope for protecting the incoming caravan.

The rival hob rulers provided essential historical context about their people and the region's supernatural guardians. [entity:7764197|Queen Zelinda] revealed that hobs once lived further upriver near a lake, where tales spoke of a giant guardian in a cavern of waterfalls. Any hob who sought the guardian never returned, leading to the creation of **curse pendants** like [entity:7764195|Gaz] wore - protective charms designed to make wearers appear cursed and therefore avoided by supernatural threats. **King Jareth** explained that hobs originated in the **Eastern lands** before a mysterious **"dark cloud"** forced their westward migration, bringing their protective traditions including multiple giant guardians.

The discovery of a **Duergar bektakor** (hooked spear) among [entity:7764197|Queen Zelinda's] artifacts confirmed the existence of the cursed lodge mentioned in warnings. The weapon's age and condition suggested the lodge had been abandoned for some time, with hob scouts who investigated it never returning alive. This connected to [entity:7763289|Alrik's] dwarven heritage and hinted at deeper mysteries about his people's presence in the region.

Most significantly, the party learned that their sought-after statue was located northwest, past the cursed **Duergar lodge** in the lake region. The connection between [entity:7763296|Qotal's] research drawings and [entity:7764195|Gaz's] protective pendant suggested their scholarly pursuits intersected with ancient protective magic in ways they were only beginning to understand.

- **Highland Waterfall Exploration** - Partially completed: ascended to plateau, eliminated hostile creatures, positioned for guardian search

## Next Steps

The party stands at a crossroads with multiple urgent priorities demanding attention. The [entity:7888221|Jailor] threat requires immediate action with the caravan's arrival imminent, though [entity:7764193|Osanna's] offer to help destroy the necrotic sigil during cloudy weather provides a viable strategy. Their position on the **highland plateau** places them close to the giant guardian they seek, with clear directions northwest past the cursed **Duergar lodge**. [entity:7763289|Alrik's] ominous vision of the raven-winged woman adds urgency to their investigations, while the source of corruption that transformed the nature spirit remains an unresolved threat. The enhanced relationships with hob royalty and [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing] experts provide valuable resources for tackling these interconnected mysteries that seem to center on ancient protective magic and supernatural guardianship of the region.
