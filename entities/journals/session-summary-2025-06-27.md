# Annie's Dark Transformation

## Session Overview

When [entity:7764100|Gierr Bjornson] reported mysterious lights and a possible sighting of missing farmer's daughter [entity:7888222|Annie], the party investigated what appeared to be a simple rescue mission. Instead, they uncovered a tragic tale of grief transformed into dark vengeance, confronting both a supernatural creature called the Jailor and the horrifying results of [entity:7763136|Diablo] worship.

## Story Developments

The morning found the party resting at [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing] after their return from forest missions, though their sleep was disrupted by a late-arriving caravan. [entity:7764194|Sigrid], a fellow [entity:7763211|Norn] working with caravans and the general store, approached [entity:7763290|Arnor] at breakfast with a kinsman's greeting. Her uncle [entity:7764100|Gierr Bjornson] had something urgent to report - strange lights over an [entity:7888225|abandoned farm] to the east, and a possible sighting of [entity:7888222|Annie], the missing farmer's daughter.

[entity:7764100|Gierr] received the party at his beekeeping operation on a small rocky island south of [entity:7764199|Rosencrantz's laboratory]. The hermit archer explained that a pioneer family had tried to establish the farm but went silent one to two months ago. **"When I was out hunting in the area a few days ago, I thought I saw something odd. A figure in the distant trees. It kinda looked like one of their daughters. A young girl by the name of Annie."** He described seeing her disappear into thick forest when spotted, along with unusual orc and goblin activity in the eastern territories.

[entity:7763693|Sylvia Mournhold] joined the party as they prepared to investigate, sharing intelligence about regional monster economics. **"The goblins, they only learned so much, but rumors are that all these monsters are gonna have to get their gems,"** she explained, revealing that creatures traded primarily in gems rather than gold and sought gem mine locations.

The eastern road led them to the sound of shouting and smashed wagons. Fresh damage and strange tracks - huge, misshapen prints a foot and a half in circumference - marked the passage of something unnatural. Following the trail brought them face to face with **the Jailor**, a colossal twenty-foot-tall creature with a massive cage built into its chest containing trapped people. The moaning and crying from within revealed its horrifying purpose: capturing victims alive rather than killing them.

The battle proved nearly disastrous. The massive undead-construct hybrid proved incredibly dangerous, its towering form allowing it to rain down devastating attacks that knocked both [entity:7763290|Arnor] and [entity:7763294|Aurelia] unconscious. When the giant creature attempted to stuff [entity:7763294|Aurelia] into its enormous chest cage but found it full, the party realized they were fortunate it sought capture rather than death. A tactical retreat became necessary when the creature's overwhelming size and power forced them to hide while it escaped at supernatural speed with its captives.

The Jailor left behind footprints filled with **"thick black stuff"** that [entity:7763290|Arnor's] religious knowledge identified as cursed material made of negative energy. The substance drained color from nearby objects, and when [entity:7763290|Arnor] tested it with divine light, it exploded violently - a reminder of how close they had come to disaster.

Continuing to the farm revealed a scene of abandonment mixed with recent habitation. The main house showed old ransacking and nature's reclamation, but the barn contained evidence of recent occupancy - a makeshift hay bed and disturbing writings on the walls in blood. [entity:7763289|Alrik] identified these as religious runes meant to contact a deity, prompting him to leave a helpful message: **"Gierr sent us to look for you and offer help. If able, knock twice."**

[entity:7763290|Arnor's] magical detection led them to the wheat field, where a horrifying discovery awaited. In the center of trampled grain lay a ritual circle bearing the symbol of [entity:7763136|Diablo], surrounded by the bodies of dead orcs and goblins. Some had tried to climb into the circle, others to escape it. Scarecrow effigies positioned throughout the field bore green orc blood on their farming tool weapons, suggesting these straw constructs had been animated to kill intruders.

The party systematically burned all the scarecrows and set the wheat field ablaze to fully expose the ritual site. As smoke rose into the sky, the distant sound of orc drums echoed through the forest. The session ended with the party hiding in the woods as drums approached, realizing that the smoke from their fire would be visible from [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing] and might attract unwanted attention.

## Combat & Challenges

The encounter with the Jailor demonstrated the frontier's supernatural dangers, as conventional tactics proved insufficient against the creature's overwhelming physical power and unique abilities. The party's near-defeat forced creative thinking about retreat and regrouping. The discovery of the cursed black substance added environmental hazards to consider, while the scarecrow evidence suggested ongoing magical threats requiring careful investigation.

## Discoveries & Lore

The case revealed the tragic progression from missing family to [entity:7763136|Diablo] worship, with [entity:7888222|Annie's] apparent survival of her family's fate leading to dark magical practices. [entity:7763136|Diablo] emerged as an archdemon of hatred, angst, and loathing requiring extreme corruption for worship. The presence of orc and goblin bodies around the ritual circle suggested [entity:7888222|Annie] had lured creatures to their deaths as part of her dark transformation. The Jailor's connection to these events remained unclear, but its timing suggested possible links to the ritual activities.

## Quest Updates

- **Annie, Are You Okay?** - Investigation revealed [entity:7888222|Annie's] survival but transformation into something dangerous
- **The Jailor Hunt** - Creature escaped with captives after defeating party in direct confrontation
- **[entity:7763136|Diablo] Ritual Investigation** - Discovered active ritual site requiring further action
- Equipment exchanges: [entity:7763294|Aurelia] traded crossbow for short bow at general store

## Next Steps

The party faces immediate danger from approaching orcs drawn by the smoke from their field burning, while larger questions loom about the Jailor's escaped captives and the active [entity:7763136|Diablo] ritual site. [entity:7888222|Annie's] fate requires resolution, and the connection between her dark practices and the supernatural creature that nearly killed them demands investigation. The burned farm now serves as an unintended beacon visible from [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing], potentially bringing both help and unwanted attention to their discovery.
