# Chapter 6 - The Jailor's Hunger

The morning after their return from forest ventures found the party's rest shattered by the rumble of wagon wheels and shouting teamsters. A late caravan had rolled into [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing] in the small hours, its arrival echoing across the bridge settlement like thunder in the darkness. When dawn finally crept over the eastern horizon, it illuminated red-rimmed eyes and stifled yawns at the mess hall's scarred tables.

[entity:7763289|Alrik Grimmelstang] approached breakfast with the methodical precision of a surgeon, wielding forceps where others might use spoons. His wild white hair caught the morning light like storm clouds as he examined each morsel with the intensity of one who had spent centuries perfecting recipes. Poor sleep had left his hands trembling, his usual culinary finesse compromised by exhaustion.

[entity:7763294|Aurelia] traced idle patterns in spilled salt, her crimson eyes distant as she contemplated the exchange she'd planned—her crossbow for a short bow, a simple transaction that spoke to adaptability in a land where survival often required reinvention. [entity:7763290|Arnor] studied the grain of the wooden table as if it might reveal prophecies, the bird skull pendant at his throat catching shadows that seemed deeper than mere morning gloom.

Their contemplation shattered when a familiar voice cut through the mess hall's drowsy murmur.

"Well met, kinsman."

[entity:7764194|Sigrid] approached their table with the confident stride of one comfortable in her own skin. The [entity:7763211|Norn] woman bore herself with the practical grace of someone who worked with caravans, her weathered hands speaking of honest labor and honest wages. When her eyes met [entity:7763290|Arnor's], kinship sparked—not just of blood, but of shared understanding between those who had left [entity:7763178|Solstheim] seeking fortunes in stranger lands.

"I'd received word from my uncle," she continued, settling into conversation with the easy familiarity of one bringing business to capable hands. "He'd requested something of you all. May have a matter for you guys."

The boat ride to [entity:7764200|Gierr's Island] carved through morning mist that clung to the water like ghostly fingers. The hermit's domain proved small and rocky—a mere outcropping south of larger islands where more ambitious projects flourished. Here, [entity:7764100|Gierr Bjornson] had built something honest and simple: lean-to shelter, the beginning hives of his beekeeping venture, and the companionship of a young dog whose tail betrayed every emotion its master's weathered face concealed.

The older [entity:7763211|Norn] greeted them with the gruff courtesy of one more comfortable with bees than people. His archer's eyes, still sharp despite his years, held worry as he gestured eastward across waters that sparkled with deceptive innocence.

"To the east of here, there was a small farm," [entity:7764100|Gierr] began, his voice carrying the weight of bad news delivered reluctantly. "This family had tried to set it up... about a month or two ago we stopped hearing from them."

The story emerged like a splinter working its way from flesh—slow, painful, inevitable. Lights flashing in the sky over the [entity:7888225|abandoned farm]. Increased orc and goblin activity in territories that should have remained quiet. And most troubling of all, a sighting that might have been hope or horror:

"When I was out hunting in the area a few days ago, I thought I saw something odd. A figure in the distant trees. It kinda looked like one of their daughters. A young girl by the name of [entity:7888222|Annie]."

The name hung in the morning air like an unresolved chord, promising either rescue or revelation. When [entity:7764194|Sigrid] placed the quest card "Annie, Are You Okay?" on their makeshift table, it felt less like an assignment than a reckoning.

---

[entity:7763693|Sylvia Mournhold] intercepted them as they prepared to leave, her [entity:7763865|Iron Kingdoms] noble bearing unable to fully disguise the wanderlust that drove her toward dangerous territories. Her intelligence about regional economics proved unexpectedly practical—monsters trading primarily in gems rather than gold, seeking mine locations to fund their raids.

"The goblins, they only learned so much," she explained, falling into step beside them with the easy confidence of one accustomed to being included, "but rumors are that all these monsters are gonna have to get their gems."

The eastern road stretched before them like a promise of trouble, its dwarven stones fitted with the precision of a civilization that expected their works to outlast empires. [entity:7763867|Natvig] accompanied them overhead, the trash griffin's bright eyes scanning terrain with intelligence that belied his scavenger nature. For three miles, the morning held peace.

Then the shouting began.

It echoed through forest that pressed close to the road's edges, human voices raised in terror and pain. The party moved toward the sounds with the grim determination of those who had learned that ignoring cries for help meant living with the consequences. When the voices fell silent, they pressed forward anyway.

The wagons, when they found them, told a story written in splintered wood and scattered goods. Damage fresh as morning dew spoke of violence recent enough that the perpetrators might still lurk nearby. But [entity:7763289|Alrik's] examination of the tracks revealed something worse than bandits or raiders.

"Bulvak," [entity:7763295|Bruldin] would have pronounced, had he been present to read the signs. The massive, misshapen prints spoke of creatures touched by realms where geometry followed rules written in pain and madness.

The trail led into forest that grew darker with each step, as if the very trees conspired to swallow light. When moaning and crying drifted through the undergrowth, [entity:7763294|Aurelia] motioned for stealth that [entity:7763289|Alrik] promptly destroyed by stepping on what might have been the only dry branch in the entire wood.

The Jailor loomed in a clearing where natural law seemed negotiable. Twenty feet of wrongness given form, it towered like a corrupted monument, bearing the shape of something that might once have been human but had been revised by forces that understood flesh as merely another medium for expression. Most horrible of all was the massive cage built into its chest—iron bars large enough to hold multiple victims, framing faces pressed against them, eyes wide with the particular terror of those who knew death approached but could not understand its delay.

[entity:7763290|Arnor's] scholarly knowledge, sharpened by years of studying the occult, identified it as something unique—a creature born from the intersection of religious fervor and undead hunger. When he shared this revelation, it came with the cold comfort of understanding an enemy's nature without diminishing its threat.

The battle erupted with the sudden violence of a summer storm. The Jailor's opening attack—a chunk of its own flesh hurled with supernatural force—struck [entity:7763290|Arnor] with crushing impact that left him reeling. The creature wanted them alive, just like its captives.

[entity:7763289|Alrik's] vine lance gleamed with holy energy as he brought it to bear, but even divine power seemed to wash over the creature like water off stone. [entity:7763294|Aurelia] called out warnings as she studied the monster—it moved like undead but held together like a construct, its flesh knitting even as they wounded it.

Her bow sang its deadly song, striking true, while [entity:7763693|Sylvia's] crossbow added supporting fire. But the towering Jailor's response demonstrated why it had survived long enough to fill its massive chest cage. [entity:7763290|Arnor] fell beneath another devastating blow from the giant's crushing limbs, the world going dark as his body crumpled to the forest floor.

[entity:7763289|Alrik] channeled divine power in a desperate prayer, golden light pouring from his hands to draw [entity:7763290|Arnor] back to consciousness while simultaneously searing the Jailor with holy radiance. But the creature's retaliation proved overwhelming—[entity:7763294|Aurelia] crumpled beneath a bone-crushing blow that sent her sprawling across the clearing, motionless.

The towering Jailor reached for [entity:7763294|Aurelia's] unconscious form, attempting to stuff her into its enormous chest cage, but found it already filled with captives. The creature paused, as if considering. A terrible understanding dawned—it collected the living, not the dead. The moaning from within its massive cage belonged to those still breathing, still hoping, still suffering.

Wounded and exhausted, they retreated behind trees, watching as the giant Jailor finally departed at supernatural speed, its massive form disappearing through the forest with its captives' cries fading into silence.

The black substance pooled in the creature's footprints defied easy categorization. [entity:7763289|Alrik's] crafting knowledge eliminated manufactured origins—not grease, not pitch, not tar. [entity:7763290|Arnor's] religious understanding provided grimmer truth: cursed material made of negative energy, substance that drained color and light from the world around it.

When [entity:7763290|Arnor] tested it with divine light, the explosion that followed sent them scrambling backward. The cursed substance reacted violently to holy energy—something they might have discovered in far worse circumstances.

An hour's rest and [entity:7763289|Alrik's] medical attention slowly restored them. His surgical precision with healing kits demonstrated skills that transcended mere cooking, though his approach to wound treatment bore the same methodical intensity he brought to custard preparation.

The one-eyed figure watching from tree shadows added another mystery to their growing collection. [entity:7763867|Natvig's] investigation ended when the entity simply ceased—not fleeing or hiding, but absent in the way that only unnatural things could manage.

The [entity:7888225|abandoned farm] revealed its story in layers. The main house showed months of nature's reclamation—door ajar, dampness seeping through walls, the slow victory of wilderness over civilization. But the barn contained evidence of recent habitation that chilled them more than any haunting.

A makeshift bed of hay. Fresh tracks belonging to a female humanoid. And on the walls, writings in blood that [entity:7763289|Alrik's] religious knowledge identified as runes designed to contact deities. His message—"Gierr sent us to look for you and offer help. If able, knock twice"—echoed in the barn's silence without response.

[entity:7763290|Arnor's] magical detection led them to the wheat field, where the true horror awaited. The ritual circle trampled into grain bore symbols that his specialized knowledge identified immediately: the mark of [entity:7763136|Diablo], archdemon of hatred and loathing.

Around the circle, bodies told their own grim tale. Orcs and goblins, some attempting to climb into the ritual space, others trying to escape it. The scarecrow effigies positioned throughout the field bore green orc blood on their farming tool weapons—evidence of animation, of straw given purpose and hunger.

[entity:7888222|Annie's] transformation revealed itself in the methodical cruelty of the scene. Grief for her lost family had curdled into something darker, turning her into a lure for creatures she could sacrifice to powers that fed on hatred. The [entity:7763136|Diablo] ritual required extreme corruption, and she had found hers in the ashes of everything she had once loved.

The party's response proved swift and thorough. Scarecrows burned like torches throughout the field, their straw hearts consumed by cleansing flame. The wheat field itself followed, smoke rising toward a sky that promised rain but delivered only judgment.

As the smoke climbed toward the heavens, drums echoed from the eastern forest. Orc drums, beating the rhythm of war or investigation. They took cover in woods opposite the sound, watching the fire they had set—a blaze that would be visible from [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing], a beacon that might bring rescue or unwanted attention in equal measure.

The drums grew louder, closer. Somewhere to the west, the Jailor carried its captives to an unknown fate. And here, hidden in shadow while wheat burned away the evidence of [entity:7888222|Annie's] fall from grief to damnation, they waited to see what the approaching drums would bring.
