# Chapter 11 - The Necromancer's Welcome

The morning of Aestra-Orpheus 28th arrived with the weight of unfinished business. [entity:7888221|The Jailor] still prowled the eastern territories, its massive cage collecting victims while the party built their strength through careful preparation. At [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing], breakfast conversation turned not to immediate action but to the more subtle art of cultivating alliances—the kind that might mean the difference between survival and becoming additions to the construct's grim collection.

[entity:7763296|Qotal] spent his second day with [entity:7764195|Gaz], the [entity:7766459|hob] server whose pleasant demeanor masked valuable connections to the region's [entity:7766459|hob] communities. Though their conversations yielded no immediate revelations, the [entity:7763230|Slaan] monk understood that friendship was a currency measured in trust rather than information. The time invested now would pay dividends when the need arose, and in frontier lands where enemies could become spectators to your struggles, such relationships transcended mere social courtesy.

[entity:7763289|Alrik Grimmelstang] found purpose in pursuing [entity:7763693|Sylvia Mournhold], learning that the young noble's family name carried weight throughout the [entity:7763865|Iron Kingdoms]—comparable to a Wellington in military renown. Her careful study of maps and consultation with [entity:7766459|hob] scouts revealed ambitions beyond simple frontier commerce. She sought trade routes for mining and gem acquisition, her aristocratic bearing matched by merchant's practicality. The benefit proved immediately tangible: she would purchase gems and other goods at better prices than typical traders, her military connections ensuring secure transport of valuable materials.

But it was [entity:7763290|Arnor Josefson] who achieved the day's greatest success. His archery practice with [entity:7764100|Gierr Bjornson] transcended mere skill demonstration—arrows flew true with precision that earned the older [entity:7763211|Norn] hunter's genuine respect. [entity:7764100|Gierr] revealed his traditional lifestyle: finding pelts for [entity:7764194|Sigrid] to sell, creating scrimshaw carvings from bones, raising bees for proper Nornish mead. The friendship sealed that day came with tangible benefit—before each mission, [entity:7764100|Gierr] would provide a **Norn Brew**, an elixir crafted to the party's capabilities that honored ancient warrior traditions.

At breakfast, [entity:7763290|Arnor] shared news that cast shadow over their preparations. [entity:7764102|Aelysh's] familiar had discovered a fresh medallion bearing the symbol of **Eris**, goddess of discord and chaos. [entity:7763289|Alrik] identified the deity immediately—a Keeper of Balance alongside [entity:7763137|Pharasma] and [entity:7763165|Tyrael], her followers known as **Priests of Discord** who prevented any faction from achieving dangerous dominance. The medallion's unworn condition suggested active operations rather than ancient remnant, adding another layer to the frontier's already complex supernatural politics.

[entity:7763296|Qotal] offered his own revelation, recounting [entity:7764104|Iridessa's] request to deliver herbs to a deeper grove. There he had found a silver-furred fox caught in a snare, its leg badly injured but strangely trusting. After freeing the creature and treating its wound with the salve provided, the fox had dug up a leather bundle containing his staff's **striking rune**—payment for kindness rendered without expectation of reward. The story earned [entity:7763289|Alrik's] warning about fey trickery, citing his own petrification as cautionary tale. [entity:7763296|Qotal] corrected him with gentle precision—basilisks, not fairies, had turned both chef and sprite to stone.

The exchange descended into good-natured bickering about [entity:7763289|Alrik's] secret ingredients until [entity:7763866|Lyn Chong] arrived carrying supplies bound for [entity:7764196|Rosencrantz's] laboratory. The elderly monk confirmed their collaboration had borne fruit: using ichor from the party's previous [entity:7888221|Jailor] encounter, they had created specialized weapons designed to confuse the construct's simple logic. The bombs would be ready by day's end, timed perfectly with [entity:7763289|Alrik's] weather prediction—clouds arriving that afternoon and lingering, providing the overcast conditions necessary for [entity:7764193|Osanna Von Carstein] to venture forth during daylight hours.

As evening approached and storm clouds gathered as predicted, [entity:7763289|Alrik] received vision during his communion with spirits. **Skuld**, the [entity:7763211|Norn] deity of future, granted sight of ravens flying in ominous formation—but more disturbing was the giant winged humanoid woman with raven wings approaching their direction. [entity:7763289|Alrik] emphasized with grim certainty: "Definitely not a valkyrie." The warning hung over their preparations like sword suspended by fraying thread, another threat converging on their frontier haven while they focused on immediate dangers.

The morning of Aestra-Orpheus 29th arrived with persistent clouds and light rain—perfect conditions for vampire assistance. [entity:7763296|Qotal] prepared four **lesser elixirs of life** through careful alchemical process, distributing the basic healing potions among companions who might need emergency restoration during combat. [entity:7763866|Lyn Chong] delivered the three **anti-Jailor bombs** with solemn instruction: they were fine-tuned to the construct's specific nature and would confuse its simple logic for precious few rounds. "Make them count," the monk warned, "because this is all I could create." [entity:7763296|Qotal] volunteered to carry the bombs, his dexterity making him ideal for ranged deployment.

[entity:7764193|Osanna] approached [entity:8051165|the cursed stone formation] with theatrical flair that proved, initially, to be another of her elaborate pranks. Her sudden yelling drew alarm until the party realized she toyed with them—but when she reached the pedestal mechanism atop the skull-shaped structure and pressed the activation rune, her screams carried genuine agony. Electrical shock threw her violently through the air to land unconscious and dazed, her vampire nature reacting poorly to the pulse of positive energy released during deactivation.

[entity:7763289|Alrik's] medicine check confirmed she had been genuinely hurt, and [entity:7763290|Arnor's] theory proved sound—the mechanism's deactivation released positive energy that would harm undead intruders attempting to disable it. Ironic security for a necromantic lair, but effective against the supernatural threats most likely to seek entry. The necrotic curse field that would have dealt devastating vulnerability damage now dissipated, revealing the actual entrance inside the skull formation.

Before descending, [entity:7764193|Osanna] made them promise to share detailed accounts of their discoveries. [entity:7763290|Arnor] assured her with grim humor that she would provide the wine for that telling—blood wine, she promised, in plenty. Then they descended into darkness.

---

The stairs wound downward into passages sized for creatures far larger than human—wide enough for [entity:7888221|the Jailor] or similar beings to navigate without difficulty. The tunnels bore none of dwarven stonework's characteristic precision, their walls carved through bedrock with different philosophy and purpose. Most unsettling was the oppressive spiritual weight that pressed against them like physical burden, suppressing natural power and draining at the soul itself.

"Malaise," [entity:7763290|Arnor] identified the sensation, his connection to spirits providing vocabulary for what they all felt. "This place is cursed. The spirits here are dark and dreadful."

[entity:7763296|Qotal] agreed from perspective rooted in different tradition. "This place is not wholesome. The power of nature is suppressed here."

[entity:7764103|Vidia] hovered above them providing light, nervously chewing her fingernails until [entity:7763289|Alrik] offered licorice and gentle admonishment. The sprite's anxiety seemed entirely reasonable given the atmosphere—whatever resided in these tunnels required no illumination, operating in absolute darkness that served both concealment and comfort.

Hundreds of tiny skeletons littered the passage as they proceeded deeper. [entity:7763296|Qotal's] nature knowledge identified them as rodents—rats and mice of various sizes, all dead from causes other than the necrotic field above. The mystery of their demise remained unsolved as the crunching of small bones beneath their feet provided grim percussion to their descent.

The sound of movement from ceiling holes came with scant warning. Spider snakes descended on silk threads, their hybrid nature making them somehow more disturbing than either arachnid or serpent alone. They attacked with coordinated precision, dropping to strike with venomous fangs before attempting to pull back into ceiling sanctuaries.

The battle proved brutal. The purple spider snake's thread held true, allowing hit-and-run tactics that frustrated [entity:7763289|Alrik] even as he resisted the venom pumping through his veins. The larger red spider snake's thread snapped, forcing it into sustained melee where its size and strength proved most dangerous. [entity:7763296|Qotal] took the worst of the venom, his critical failure on fortitude defense leaving him wracked with ongoing poison damage that tested even monastic discipline.

[entity:7763290|Arnor's] **electric arc** proved devastating, his scholarly understanding of elemental forces channeled into combat effectiveness. When the smaller creatures failed their defensive attempts, the doubled damage from critical failures eliminated them swiftly. But the red spider snake fought with desperate ferocity, its attacks eventually overwhelming [entity:7763289|Alrik's] resilience and sending him crashing unconscious to the stone floor.

The creature's fury found new target in [entity:7763290|Arnor], landing a critical hit that dealt massive damage and dropped the [entity:7763211|Norn] wizard like puppet with cut strings. Only [entity:7763295|Bruldin's] battlefield medicine and [entity:7763296|Qotal's] renewed assault prevented complete disaster. When [entity:7763289|Alrik] finally rose and sent **needle darts** piercing through the spider snake's multiple eyes, his triumphant curse echoed with satisfaction earned through pain endured.

They spent precious time recovering, refocusing their energies while examining adjacent chambers. [entity:7763296|Qotal] discovered a hidden stone door that proved entirely non-functional—carved decoration rather than actual passage, with no mechanism and no magic detected despite thorough examination. [entity:7763290|Arnor's] attempt to force through the solid stone accomplished nothing but bruised dignity. Some mysteries, it seemed, would remain sealed regardless of their efforts.

The large bone chamber presented sight both fascinating and disturbing—a massive pile of accumulated remains with raised platform leading to extra-wide door at the far end. As they entered, the bones erupted with squeaking fury as diseased giant rats emerged in coordinated waves.

The combat proved briefer but no less dangerous than their previous encounter. [entity:7763295|Bruldin] obliterated one rat with single blow that left only small stain on stone, his divine strength channeled through warrior's arm. [entity:7763296|Qotal], contracting disease from rat bite through critical failure that left him with indefinite **Clumsy 1** condition, vented his fury on the creature responsible. "If he's dead I'm gonna attack his carcass," the monk declared with uncharacteristic anger. "I'm mad."

The rat died to his second strike, but [entity:7763296|Qotal] maintained enough self-awareness to redirect remaining fury toward living targets. [entity:7763289|Alrik's] **needle darts** sent another rat flying to stick against the wall in gruesome display, while [entity:7763290|Arnor's] sonic magic—"singing them the song of my people," as he described it—weakened multiple creatures through area damage. The blue wave arrived to replace the green, but the party's coordination proved equal to the challenge. When [entity:7763290|Arnor] roasted the final rat with fire spell, its death marked temporary respite in their descent into darkness.

The sound of dragging interrupted their recovery. Someone emerged from deeper passages, pulling large cloth pouch behind her. When she saw the party, she dropped her burden inside the doorway and straightened to full height.

The figure defied easy categorization—large and tall, with no visible eyes and horns covering the head area like grotesque crown. Her cloak drew the eye with horrible fascination: flayed skins from various creatures, different colors and sizes stitched together in gruesome patchwork. Most appeared to be medium-sized beings, and some—some could have been human. The craftsmanship spoke of practice and preference rather than mere necessity.

She spoke first in language they didn't recognize, though [entity:7763290|Arnor] identified it as **Necral**—he had heard [entity:7764193|Osanna] speak it before. Irritation colored her voice when she switched to Common. "Oh fine, I'll speak that wretched language you all speak."

"I, for the life of me, don't know how you made it in here and got past, um, the security, um, we had set up, or that I have set up." The slip from "we" to "I" suggested collaborators or masters she preferred not to mention. "Um, I'll tell you what. Um, to prevent yourself a slow and agonizing painful death as I get the information from you, I'll give you the opportunity to simply tell me how you, uh, came in here."

[entity:7763289|Alrik] rose to the occasion with response that matched theatrical threat with culinary absurdity. "We simply knocked on the front door and when nobody answered, we just let ourself in. We're the neighborhood welcoming committee. We had a welcoming cake but we got hungry and ate it on the way in." His grin widened. "I do love some good sarcasm."

The necromancer regarded them with expression impossible to read on her eyeless face. "Fine," she said, turning away with casual dismissal that chilled more than rage would have. She muttered in Necral, a single word that carried weight of command and communion with forces beyond mortal understanding.

"Arise."

The bone pile responded to her will like ocean to moon's pull. Skeletons assembled themselves from scattered remains, including one particularly large specimen that towered over its companions. She gestured toward the party with languid authority. "Bring them to me, um, alive at the least."

Then she turned and retreated toward the inner chambers, leaving her risen guardians to collect or destroy these intruders who had breached security that had kept others out for who knew how long. The door through which she passed promised deeper mysteries and darker experiments, but first they would have to survive the skeletal army rising between them and their objective.

[entity:7763296|Qotal] glanced at the bombs he carried—weapons designed for construct rather than undead, tools for the battle they had expected rather than the one they faced. Behind them lay passages filled with spider nests and rat-gnawed remains. Before them stood the necromancer's guardians, bone soldiers commanded to capture rather than kill.

And somewhere beyond, in chambers they had not yet reached, [entity:7888221|the Jailor] waited—whether as the necromancer's servant or her tool remained unclear, but the connection between flesh construct and bone mistress promised revelations purchased through combat and survival.

The skeleton army advanced with grinding patience of beings who knew no fear, no fatigue, no hesitation. The party readied their weapons, the bone chamber's oppressive atmosphere pressing down with weight of accumulated death and dark purpose. They had come seeking one monster and found another, but retreat meant abandoning whatever victims the necromancer had collected in her cloth pouch, whatever experiments she conducted in the depths of [entity:8051165|Skull Rock].

The eleventh chapter of their frontier saga balanced on edge between discovery and disaster, while above them the clouds lingered and [entity:7764193|Osanna] lay unconscious beside the deactivated curse field. Below stretched passages they had yet to explore, mysteries they had yet to unravel, and the necromancer who wore death as fashion statement waited for her skeletal servants to deliver what they had failed to yield through intimidation.

The bones clattered forward, and the party met them with steel and spell and determination forged through trials that had taught them to face the impossible with stubborn competence. Whatever awaited in the deeper chambers would have to wait—first they would teach this necromancer that some welcoming committees arrived with more than cake and sarcasm.

They brought justice dressed as frontier practicality, and neither flayed skins nor risen bones would turn them from their purpose.
