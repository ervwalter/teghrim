# Wagon Wreckage and Bulvak Raiders

## Session Overview

After completing weapon repairs and spending time with local contacts, the party investigated reports of abandoned wagons west of [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing]. What began as a salvage mission evolved into a desperate rescue operation, revealing new threats from demon-touched raiders and mysterious observers.

## Story Developments

The morning of Aestra-Orpheus 14th found the party gathered for breakfast, discussing their options while weapons underwent repair. [entity:7763296|Qotal] revealed his crafting expertise to his companions, offering to identify magical items and perform repairs using his **Crafter's Appraisal** abilities. The [entity:7763230|Slaan monk] successfully identified several items from their recent adventures: a **dwarven clan dagger** bearing a +1 potency rune, a **missive mint** capable of conveying 25-word alchemical messages, and a **concealed sheath** that provided bonuses for hiding light weapons.

[entity:7763294|Aurelia] arranged to transfer the +1 potency rune from the clan dagger to her cold iron rapier during repairs, awaiting her weapon's restoration. The party debated their next move, weighing various outstanding quests. [entity:7763296|Qotal] warned that abandoned wagons would likely be scavenged by wilderness creatures "sooner than later," but the group decided to spend the day pursuing personal interests while weapons were repaired.

During downtime, party members scattered to build relationships. [entity:7763296|Qotal] visited [entity:7764102|Aelysh] to learn about her scientific approach to nature studies. [entity:7763294|Aurelia] spent time with [entity:7763693|Sylvia], discovering the noble's expertise in [entity:7763865|Iron Kingdoms] knowledge. [entity:7763290|Arnor] called upon [entity:7764193|Osanna Von Carstein], learning about her specialty in [entity:7763172|Astoria] lore. [entity:7763289|Alrik] continued his visits with [entity:7764196|Rosencrantz], their discussion of engineering and scientific methodology yielding particular success.

That evening, [entity:7763290|Arnor] invited his companions to join him for a moon ritual in the woods outside town. In a cleared circular space beneath the waning gibbous moon, [entity:7763290|the Norn wanderer] formally introduced his familiar. **"This is Natvig,"** he explained as the trash griffin perched nearby. **"He is my familiar. He acts as my go-between with the spirits from whom I gain my spells."** [entity:7763867|The crow-raccoon hybrid] made distinctive chirping-croak sounds, especially when [entity:7763296|Qotal] tossed him a food scrap. While [entity:7763289|Alrik] dozed through the ceremony and [entity:7763294|Aurelia] enjoyed the night air, [entity:7763290|Arnor] sang to the moon in ancient tradition.

The second morning brought reunited party and repaired weapons. [entity:7763289|Alrik], having prepared breakfast using his medical tools in characteristic fashion, urged immediate action: **"If we are going to investigate this wagon, I think we must do it soon. Perhaps today."** With [entity:7763294|Aurelia's] newly enhanced rapier in hand and the party restored to full strength, they set out west along the dwarven-built road.

[entity:7763867|Natvig] accompanied them, flying alongside for three miles while casting hopeful glances at [entity:7763296|Qotal]. The well-constructed road, reminiscent of Roman engineering and built within the last forty years, led them to a scene of destruction. Wagons lay smashed with wheels broken and goods scattered, yet no bodies remained at the site. Investigation revealed tracks leading away - the work of bulvaks, as the Game Master explained. These demon-touched, minotaur-like creatures from another plane regularly attacked frontier settlements, their name properly pronounced "bow-volk."

Following the tracks led deeper into increasingly dark and foreboding woods. When human cries of distress echoed ahead, the party attempted a stealthy approach that failed spectacularly. Beast-like humanoids with spears, making sounds reminiscent of Tusken Raiders, detected their advance. [entity:7763290|Arnor] opened combat with **Needle Darts** while [entity:7763294|Aurelia's] crossbow found its mark. When one creature charged a party member with its spear, they delivered a devastating counterstrike. The brief but intense skirmish ended with all three attackers defeated, but continuing screams revealed these weren't the source of the distress calls.

Racing forward, the party emerged into a clearing to witness bulvak creatures fleeing with bound human prisoners. A desperate chase ensued through multiple obstacles: thick forest requiring athletic prowess, misty swamps testing nature knowledge, and fey testing areas where two successful athletics checks allowed them to bypass the fae. Magical illusions and a final sprint through forest clearings brought them within striking distance of their quarry.

The rescue battle pitted the party against **Gore**, a massive bulvak leader, and two smaller companions holding human captives. [entity:7763290|Arnor's] cold iron and silver needle darts proved effective while [entity:7763294|Aurelia] scored a critical hit with her crossbow. Gore managed to gore and grab [entity:7763296|Qotal], but powerful strikes from the party and [entity:7763289|Alrik's] maul swings quickly turned the tide. When Gore fell, one smaller bulvak moved protectively to the body while continuing to fight. The party eliminated all three captors with a final blow to the last defender's face.

The rescued caravan guards, beaten and dragged through brush during their captivity, expressed profound gratitude. They explained their ambush while traveling, having not expected bulvak raiders. As the party searched the bodies, discovering gems rather than gold on Gore's corpse, a mysterious **one-eyed figure** watched from the treeline. The entity, possessing a single glowing eye, vanished when noticed. [entity:7763289|Alrik] commented nervously, **"They're following me. They want my recipe."**

Strange fae creatures materialized from nowhere, tiny beings with annoying voices asking nonsensical riddles. Between queries about ravens and writing desks, one statement emerged clearly: **"It must be Tessa."** The reference meant nothing to the confused party, and the fae vanished as mysteriously as they'd appeared.

Returning to [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing] with the rescued guards, [entity:7764097|Captain Irka Spritzel] met them at the town entrance. **"Good, some of the guards are not dead. That is very good,"** he observed with characteristic practicality. The captain provided 40 gold pieces as reward for the successful rescue, though the destroyed wagons and their cargo remained lost to the wilderness.

## Combat & Challenges

The forest ambush tested the party against spear-wielding beastmen whose strange vocalizations added an unsettling element to combat. The chase sequence through varied terrain challenged different skills, from athletic prowess in thick forest to handling fey interference with intimidation. The climactic battle against Gore and his bulvak raiders required tactical coordination to prevent the demon-touched creatures from escaping with their prisoners, with Gore's grappling abilities adding dangerous complications.

## Discoveries & Lore

Bulvaks revealed themselves as organized raiders rather than mindless monsters, taking prisoners for unknown purposes rather than simply killing. Their demon-touched nature and origin from another plane suggests broader threats to frontier settlements. The appearance of both the one-eyed observer and the cryptic fae mentioning "Tessa" introduces new mysteries. The party's extended theological discussions during travel touched on creation myths and racial origins, though no consensus emerged regarding which deity created humanity.

## Quest Updates

- **Wagon Recovery Mission** - Wagons destroyed beyond salvage, but guards successfully rescued from bulvak captors
- **The 40 Gold Rescue** - [entity:7764097|Captain Irka] rewarded party for saving caravan guards
- Remaining quests still pending: supply delivery with [entity:7764195|Gaz], elderberry procurement, basilisk threat, shrine restoration, witch coven establishment

## Next Steps

With the wagon situation resolved and guards rescued, the party must decide which outstanding quest to pursue next. The mysterious mentions of "Tessa" and the one-eyed observer suggest new complications developing around [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing]. Immediate options include [entity:7764195|Gaz's] supply delivery mission, investigating the basilisk threat, or pursuing leads on elderberries, shrine restoration, or [entity:7763290|Arnor's] witch coven establishment.
