# Rafts, Ruins, and Raging Battle

## Session Overview

After completing their week-long [entity:8248775|Highland Uplands] expedition, the party returned to [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing] for much-needed rest. [entity:7763296|Qotal] discovered his grove ransacked by fey celebrating an epic [entity:7766459|Gollveinball] tournament, with [entity:7764102|Aelysh's] familiar [entity:8269451|Rupert] mysteriously missing. Following two days of downtime strengthening relationships and addressing personal quests, the full party traveled to [entity:8248838|Island Dwarven Ruins] in [entity:8248836|Waterfall Lake]. They successfully crafted a blessed raft, crossed the lake at high speed using a **feather token fan**, and immediately engaged in a brutal three-way battle against **grolschs** (yeti-ogre hybrids) and unidentified winged creatures. The session ended mid-combat with multiple enemies still active.

## Story Developments

The party's return on Orpheus 12th marked the completion of their most ambitious exploration yet. [entity:7763296|Qotal], [entity:7763289|Alrik], and [entity:7763295|Bruldin] had spent a full week in the [entity:8248775|Highland Uplands] with [entity:7764100|Gierr Bjornson], defeating dragon ogres, discovering [entity:8248838|Island Dwarven Ruins] in [entity:8248836|Waterfall Lake], and finding a mysterious mountain path to caves where one-eyed birds originate. [entity:7764097|Captain Irka] greeted them with relief—the settlement was still recovering from a chaotic week when a large Vanguard caravan had brought partying, fighting, and bridge-jumping antics to the frontier outpost.

[entity:7763296|Qotal] found [entity:7764106|Aelysh's Grove] in complete disarray. The three fairies—[entity:7764098|Silvermist], [entity:7764099|Fawn], and [entity:7764104|Iridessa]—explained that wild fey had held a massive gathering called **Glindorflor** during the party's absence, featuring a chaotic **Gollveinball** tournament and celebrations that ransacked the treehouse. [entity:7764104|Iridessa] began reciting an epic saga explaining how each item got moved, promising days of storytelling. [entity:7763296|Qotal's] theatrical display with cold iron finally drove the persistent fairies back, though they continued their tale from a safer distance.

More concerning was [entity:7764102|Aelysh's] discovery that [entity:8269451|Rupert], her leshy familiar, had gone missing along with various tools and supplies. Whether the disappearance resulted from fey chaos or something more sinister remained unclear.

The party spent two days recovering and pursuing personal goals. [entity:7763296|Qotal] and [entity:7763294|Aurelia] helped restore the grove while strengthening their friendship with [entity:7764102|Aelysh]. [entity:7763295|Bruldin] investigated the **Battle of Rothfuss Delta** from 80 years ago, seeking information about dwarven survivors. [entity:7764097|Captain Irka] suggested the Duergar or [entity:7764100|Gierr] might know something. [entity:7763295|Bruldin] also spent time with [entity:7763693|Sylvia Mournhold], learning how the [entity:7763863|Iron Kingdoms] had changed over the past 150-200 years—the Black Templars and Holy Synod had grown from minor organizations to major religions.

[entity:7763290|Arnor] completed his prayer cycle and received an **augury token** for divine guidance. His familiar [entity:7763867|Natvig] reported concerning news: some witch graffiti showed pecking and clawing marks, and the Black Templars had shown interest in the carvings during their recent visit. Sigrid warned him to be careful and promised information about potential witch cult recruits and secure ritual locations.

On Orpheus 15th, the party purchased Mendel's cake from [entity:7764195|Gaz] and paid the troll toll to [entity:8051164|Grogug], negotiating future passage in exchange for Brine Drake meat. At the top of the falls, they built a blessed raft through collaborative effort—[entity:7763296|Qotal] finding perfect timber, [entity:7763295|Bruldin] hauling logs, [entity:7763294|Aurelia] rigging secure knots, and [entity:7763289|Alrik] blessing the vessel with divine protection.

After a day-and-a-half journey, they arrived at [entity:8248836|Waterfall Lake] on Orpheus 16th. The spectacular vista revealed an eight-mile lake surrounded by mountains and waterfalls, with the [entity:8248838|Island Dwarven Ruins] rising from the center. Smoke from campfires confirmed active occupation by large, wooly creatures. [entity:7763294|Aurelia] activated a **feather token fan**, and the raft shot forward at tremendous speed, crashing dramatically into the island's docks as battle erupted immediately.

## Combat & Challenges

The party identified the woolly creatures as **grolschs**—yeti-ogre hybrids intelligent enough to form camps and communicate. The creatures spotted the approaching raft immediately, with a massive leader and multiple groups taking defensive positions across the multi-level ruins.

Battle erupted upon landing. The grolschs proved formidable with their signature **power slam** attacks that picked up and smashed opponents into the ground. They hurled boulders and giant acorns with impressive dexterity, reloading slings using both hands and feet even while in trees. [entity:7763294|Aurelia's] tactical knowledge revealed their critical weakness—fire vulnerability inherited from their yeti heritage. Fire-based attacks proved devastatingly effective.

The battle escalated when unidentified **winged creatures** entered as a third faction, wielding bows from aerial positions. The creatures demonstrated territorial aggression, and in one dramatic moment dropped a burning grolsch to its death. Something also shot fire from a statue or formation on the island, whether autonomous defense or controlled attack remaining unclear. The party found themselves caught in a chaotic three-way battle with multiple enemies still active when combat paused mid-encounter.

## Discoveries & Lore

The **grolschs** proved to be intelligent yeti-ogre hybrids capable of forming camps, using tools, and communicating. Their fire vulnerability from yeti heritage became their greatest weakness. The unidentified **winged creatures** nested in the upper ruins, wielding bows and demonstrating fierce territorial behavior. Something also shot fire from within the ruins—whether autonomous defense, trapped entity, or controlled weapon remained unclear.

During downtime, the party learned that the **Black Templars** had grown from a minor organization 150-200 years ago to one of the major religions spreading across the [entity:7763863|Iron Kingdoms]. Their recent interest in [entity:7763290|Arnor's] witch graffiti and the damaged markings on his symbols suggested growing scrutiny of supernatural activities. [entity:7764102|Aelysh's] missing familiar [entity:8269451|Rupert] remained an unresolved mystery—the fey celebration seemed the obvious cause, but the disappearance of tools and supplies hinted at something more deliberate.

## Quest Updates

## Next Steps

The party must complete their three-way battle with multiple grolschs and winged creatures still active. Several characters are heavily wounded, making the combat's continuation particularly dangerous. The fire vulnerability discovery provides tactical advantage, but the unidentified winged creatures and fire-shooting entity add unpredictable elements.

Once combat resolves, the true exploration begins. The multi-level dwarven structure holds answers to [entity:7763296|Qotal's] lifelong quest about the broken hammer mystery. The [entity:7766459|hobs'] deep superstitions about this place—believing it cursed particularly for dwarves—add weight to their investigation. What guardians might still function after centuries, and whether the curse affects [entity:7763295|Bruldin], remain unknown.

Back at [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing], [entity:8269451|Rupert's] disappearance requires investigation. [entity:7763295|Bruldin's] pursuit of information about the **Battle of Rothfuss Delta** continues, seeking closure about dwarven casualties from 80 years ago. [entity:7763290|Arnor's] witch cult faces growing scrutiny from Black Templars, with escalating risks as the cult's profile rises. Multiple factions watch the party's activities—Celtic druids, one-eyed emanations, and religious orders—revealing the frontier's complex supernatural infrastructure.
