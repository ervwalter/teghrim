# Chapter 10 - Crowns and Waterfalls

The morning after [entity:7763294|Aurelia's] revelation had settled into comfortable acceptance found [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing] humming with purposeful activity. Breakfast conversations carried the weight of urgent decisions—[entity:7888221|the Jailor] still haunted the eastern territories, its massive cage collecting victims while time ticked toward the approaching caravan's arrival. The party had learned enough to understand their enemy but not yet enough to defeat it.

[entity:7763289|Alrik Grimmelstang] attacked his morning meal with characteristic intensity, though fatigue made his usually precise movements fumble like a drunk patron navigating bridge planks. Sleep had eluded them all—some problems weighed too heavily for easy rest, and the supernatural threats gathering around [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing] seemed to multiply faster than they could resolve them.

[entity:7763296|Qotal's] scholarly mind turned toward systematic consultation. Their previous encounters had taught harsh lessons about charging blindly into supernatural threats. The [entity:8051165|Cursed Stone Formation] remained too dangerous to approach, [entity:7888221|the Jailor] represented a threat beyond their current capabilities, and the mysterious [entity:7797914|One-Eyed Figure] continued its cryptic observations with apparent supernatural patience.

"We need expert advice," the [entity:7763230|Slaan] monk declared with unusual directness for one typically given to measured speech. "The locals here each possess knowledge we need."

The decision to divide their efforts proved wise. [entity:7763296|Qotal] sought [entity:7764102|Aelysh] at her [entity:7764106|treehouse preserve], where the wood elf's scientific approach to botanical mysteries had impressed him during previous visits. The day spent learning herbalism and nature lore deepened his understanding of the region's supernatural ecology. [entity:7764102|Aelysh] shared with him her techniques for helping those afflicted by disease and poison, her connection to the natural world allowing recoveries that seemed almost miraculous. Her friendship carried weight beyond mere social courtesy—when natural mysteries demanded answers, she would prioritize his questions regardless of her other obligations.

Meanwhile, [entity:7763289|Alrik] found purpose in honest labor with [entity:7763866|Lyn Chong], whose zen temple construction project reflected the elderly monk's methodical approach to spiritual practice. The exchange proved mutually beneficial—[entity:7763289|Alrik's] assistance with temple building earned genuine friendship, while [entity:7763866|Lyn's] divine power offered hope for countering cursed effects that conventional medicine couldn't address.

Most significantly, [entity:7763290|Arnor] deepened his connection with [entity:7764193|Osanna Von Carstein], discovering secrets that elevated their relationship beyond diplomatic courtesy. The vampire noble's hidden interest in occultism—knowledge she kept carefully concealed from other vampires—opened doors to understanding constructs and undead-construct hybrids like [entity:7888221|the Jailor].

Her offer to help destroy the necrotic force field's controlling sigil during cloudy conditions represented more than tactical assistance—it promised partnership in confronting threats that conventional approaches couldn't handle. The intelligence she provided about constructs often being bound to controlling entities added crucial context to their growing understanding of the massive creature's nature.

But it was [entity:7763289|Alrik's] vision that cast shadow over their planning. During his communion with spirits, **Skuld**—the [entity:7763211|Norn] deity of future—granted him sight of ravens flying in unusual formation, their dark wings carrying message of approaching doom. The giant winged humanoid woman with raven wings he glimpsed through divine revelation flew toward their direction with purpose that chilled him more than supernatural winter.

"Definitely not a valkyrie," he reported grimly, the implications hanging over their breakfast like storm clouds gathering on distant horizons.

The morning's consultations had provided tools and allies, but also confirmation that multiple threats converged on their frontier haven. Time was running out, and solutions remained frustratingly beyond reach.

Their expedition to the northern waterfall region carried hope of different answers. [entity:7764195|Gaz] guided them via small raft through waters that reflected morning light like scattered coins, her knowledge of [entity:7766459|hob] politics proving essential as they approached territories where diplomacy mattered as much as combat prowess.

"You should probably meet both eventually," she advised, her practical wisdom cutting through their tactical uncertainties, "because King... Goblin King... he's really good with lore though, 'cause he would know tons and tons and tons of stuff."

The strategic importance of their mission crystallized as they traveled upstream. [entity:7763296|Qotal's] research drawings of dwarven imagery matched [entity:7764195|Gaz's] protective pendant too closely for coincidence—somewhere in these territories lay answers to mysteries that had driven him across continents.

[entity:7764197|Queen Zelinda's] settlement revealed itself as elaborate theater of royal pretension. The grand hut surrounded by smaller dwellings backed into defensive tree positions, while fetishes and protective charms hung like supernatural armor from every available surface. Her formal introduction—a parade of titles that included **"Her Royal Eminence and Imperador Zelinda, Queen of the Icenii, Scion of the Eldrazi, The Six-Hokage of the Leafy Village, Duchess of Shale, Lord of the North Land, and leader of its peoples"**—demonstrated appetite for recognition that bordered on hunger.

The social encounter that followed tested their diplomatic skills against [entity:7764197|Queen Zelinda's] evident need for validation. [entity:7763295|Bruldin's] astrological knowledge proved particularly effective, his bestowing of the title **"Queen of the Starry River"** delighting her with its cosmic significance. [entity:7763296|Qotal's] contribution of **"Queen of the Ecliptic Veil"** complemented perfectly, explaining the cosmic power and energy of day and night sky residing within her royal presence.

[entity:7763289|Alrik's] religious insight provided the capstone with **"Divine Mistress and Guardian of the River Wild,"** acknowledging her spiritual authority over the waterways that defined her territory. The courtly behavior that [entity:7763290|Arnor] demonstrated through his greeting of **"Queen Zelinda, the Graciousness of Hosts"** appealed to her desire for noble recognition, though it became apparent she imitated what she thought nobility looked like rather than displaying genuine aristocratic bearing.

When [entity:7763296|Qotal] finally presented his research question, connecting his drawings to [entity:7764195|Gaz's] pendant, the response revealed lore that chilled them more than mountain air.

"Once upon a time when we were further up in the river, us hobs lived further up on the lake up there," [entity:7764197|Queen Zelinda] explained, her voice carrying weight of inherited warnings. "Well before my time, there are tales told of a giant guardian who rests in a cavern of waterfalls... Any hob who's gone to see him has never returned."

The guardian's origin story painted picture of tragedy transformed into supernatural sentinel—a royal guard or noble person trapped by growing ego until escape from the waterfall cavern became impossible. The curse pendants like [entity:7764195|Gaz] wore served as protective deception, making wearers appear cursed to supernatural threats that might otherwise prove hostile.

[entity:7763289|Alrik's] keen observation of the **Duergar bektakor** among [entity:7764197|Queen Zelinda's] artifacts added troubling context. The old but well-preserved hooked spear confirmed the existence of the cursed lodge mentioned in warnings—scouts who investigated it had never returned, their fate joining the growing catalog of mysteries that surrounded the waterfall region.

The warning she provided carried personal concern despite their brief acquaintance: **"I would never give an item like the one I gave to her to you because that would be a double curse... don't worry, I am sympathetic for you. You shall be in my... I shall grant you good luck and my prayers."**

---

[entity:8051161|King Jareth's] domain across the river presented striking contrast to [entity:7764197|Queen Zelinda's] theatrical majesty. Here, genuine regality resided—actual crown rather than pretense, throne that commanded rather than compensated, performers and musicians who served talent rather than ego. The Goblin King received them with confidence that needed no validation, his reputation built on knowledge rather than accumulated titles.

"Those who, those with evil in the hearts must pay the price," he revealed when [entity:7763296|Qotal] inquired about the giant guardians. "They come forth upon all in all seasons. There are many guardians, they are tied to our protector that we offer tribute to."

The revelation that multiple guardians existed throughout the region, all connected to an entity receiving [entity:7766459|hob] tribute, reframed their understanding of the supernatural hierarchy governing these territories. [entity:8051161|King Jareth's] explanation of [entity:7766459|hob] migration from the **Eastern lands** due to a mysterious **"dark cloud"** added historical context to their protective traditions.

Most crucially, his directions to the northwest, past the cursed **Duergar lodge** in the lake region, provided the geographical target their mission required. His warning that **"only evil shall pass"** to reach the statue suggested trials ahead that would test more than their combat capabilities.

The performance requirement for earning [entity:8051161|King Jareth's] favor felt more natural than [entity:7764197|Queen Zelinda's] title collection. Music represented genuine cultural exchange rather than diplomatic theater, and their combined efforts earned respect through shared artistry rather than flattery.

---

With [entity:7763295|Bruldin's] early departure due to medication side effects, the remaining party faced the waterfall region's challenges with reduced numbers but enhanced understanding. The rocky terrain slick with rain tested their agility and balance, each step a careful negotiation with wet stone, while the massive waterfall itself held guardian more gregarious than dangerous.

[entity:8051159|Grogug] the Troll emerged from behind the thundering cascade like natural force given personality, his switch from **Jotun** to Common revealing language skills learned from [entity:7766459|hob] neighbors. His toll system—one gold per person or one person as meal—represented frontier capitalism at its most direct, though his acceptance of **Mendel's** cake (provided by thoughtful [entity:7764197|Queen Zelinda]) demonstrated that reputation and gifts could substitute for currency.

"Since you guys are friends with [entity:7764195|Gaz]... I give one free pass up, one free pass down," [entity:8051159|Grogug] declared with the magnanimity of one whose generosity cost him nothing. His dark humor about dropping dead companions downriver for mutual benefit reflected troll practicality rather than genuine malice.

The treacherous stone stairs carved into the cliff face demanded careful navigation in wet conditions, each step potentially fatal if misplaced. When they finally reached the highland plateau above the waterfall, the achievement felt earned through skill rather than luck.

---

The [entity:7797914|One-Eyed Figure] that had observed their adventures for sessions chose this moment for direct confrontation. Its transformation from mist into raven-like shadow creature with single glowing eye represented culmination of supernatural surveillance that had marked their growing reputation.

[entity:7763296|Qotal's] identification of it as corrupted nature spirit provided tactical intelligence that proved crucial. The creature's resistance to most damage except cold iron turned combat into test of preparation and adaptability. [entity:7763290|Arnor's] voice rose in a resonating chorus that seemed to come from multiple throats at once, the sound battering the spirit with sonic force, while [entity:7763289|Alrik's] cold iron needle darts found their mark with deadly precision.

The spirit's ability to shift between mist and solid forms created tactical challenges that demanded coordination rather than individual heroics. When it finally dissipated into harmless vapor, the victory felt significant—they had eliminated a threat that had haunted their adventures since the beginning.

Yet the source of the spirit's corruption remained unknown, another mystery added to the growing collection of supernatural phenomena that seemed to center on this region. Their success proved they could handle individual threats, but the larger pattern suggested something more comprehensive at work.

---

The highland plateau's marshy environment harbored its own dangers in the form of competing predators that treated the party's arrival as opportunity rather than threat. Giant frogs with fifteen-foot tongue reach proved their primary challenge, their grabbing attacks capable of pulling victims within range of crushing jaws.

The battle that erupted transcended simple party-versus-monsters combat, becoming complex three-way conflict where giant flies engaged beetles while both species attacked the amphibians. [entity:7763296|Qotal] found himself grabbed and dragged toward snapping jaws, his monastic training tested against supernatural strength.

[entity:7763290|Arnor's] voice rose in that strange resonating chorus again, the sound washing over the battlefield in waves that struck multiple creatures at once, while the party exploited tactical positioning to let the monsters damage each other. The strategy conserved their strength while maximizing effectiveness—lessons learned from previous encounters where brute force had proved insufficient.

[entity:7763289|Alrik's] needle darts and combat maneuvers provided supporting fire while the [entity:7763211|Norn] wizard's spells coordinated their response. The extended battle tested endurance as much as skill, each creature eliminated through patient application of tactics rather than overwhelming assault.

When the highland marsh finally fell silent, littered with the corpses of creatures that had fought each other as much as the intruders, the party could survey terrain that stretched toward their ultimate objective. The giant guardian awaited somewhere in the northwest, past dangers yet to be discovered.

---

The highland plateau spread before them like an ancient wilderness unmarked by civilization. Somewhere in the northwest waited the cursed **Duergar lodge** that [entity:8051161|King Jareth] had warned them of, and beyond it, the giant guardian that had drawn [entity:7763296|Qotal] across continents.

The [entity:7763230|Slaan] monk stood at the edge of the plateau, studying the distant terrain with the patience of one who had traveled too far to turn back now. Behind him, [entity:7763290|Arnor] and [entity:7763289|Alrik] discussed what they had learned—the terrain's dangers, the mysterious one-eyed creature's nature, the practical challenges of extended exploration through hostile territory.

"We're not equipped for this," [entity:7763289|Alrik] said finally, gesturing at their depleted supplies and wounds that still ached despite healing. "Not yet."

[entity:7763296|Qotal] nodded slowly, acceptance settling over him like evening mist. The guardian had waited centuries. It could wait while they returned to [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing] to prepare properly. More pressing threats demanded attention—[entity:7888221|the Jailor] still collected victims in the eastern territories, and the party had promised to help stop it.

The answers [entity:7763296|Qotal] sought lay ahead, somewhere in these highlands—the place where the story of the broken hammer would finally conclude. Those answers would keep. The victims in [entity:7888221|the Jailor's] cage could not.

They turned their steps back toward the waterfall and the long climb down, carrying knowledge gained and mysteries deferred. Far below, [entity:8051159|Grogug] waited behind his cascade, ready to collect another toll or accept another gift of cake. Above, the highland plateau kept its secrets a while longer.
