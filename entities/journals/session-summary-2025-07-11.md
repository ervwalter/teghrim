# The Ritual Combat at Annie's Farm

## Session Overview

[entity:7763296|Qotal] rejoined his companions at the [entity:7888224|abandoned farm] where they discovered the tragic truth behind [entity:7888222|Annie's] disappearance. What began as a rescue mission culminated in ritual combat against demonic scarecrows while chained by dark magic, earning the party unexpected respect from [entity:7888223|orc spectators] and advancing them to their third level of experience.

## Story Developments

The afternoon smoke from the burning wheat field proved visible even from [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing]. [entity:7763296|Qotal] witnessed the massive column of smoke and joined [entity:7764100|Gierr Bjornson] in investigating its source. When they arrived at the [entity:7888224|farm], they found their companions preparing for an imminent confrontation as orc drums echoed from multiple directions through the eastern forest.

The party quickly briefed [entity:7763296|Qotal] on their disturbing discoveries: the **Diablo ritual circle** at the field's center, the piles of orc corpses around the magical sigil, and the evidence of necromantic activities in the barn. [entity:7763289|Alrik] had already identified the cursed black substance as negative energy, and the party understood they faced supernatural threats beyond simple goblin raids.

As drums grew louder, orcs and goblins emerged from the forest in significant numbers. Rather than the overwhelming assault the party feared, the creatures took defensive positions around the farm perimeter and began what appeared to be a coordinated attack. The battle erupted with [entity:7763294|Aurelia] using stealth tactics from behind hay bales while [entity:7763296|Qotal] engaged enemies in direct melee. [entity:7763290|Arnor's] **needle darts** proved devastatingly effective, and [entity:7763289|Alrik's] **force magic** quickly eliminated the orc leader threatening their position.

The coordinated spellcasting and tactical positioning allowed the party to systematically eliminate the orc archers and goblin cavalry. [entity:7763296|Qotal's] impressive martial display, including his declaration **"I am Qotal"** after delivering critical strikes, demonstrated the combat prowess that would later earn orc respect.

When the immediate threat was neutralized, a figure emerged from red mist near the ritual circle's center. [entity:7764100|Gierr] immediately recognized her as [entity:7888222|Annie], the missing farmer's daughter they had come to rescue. Her bitter words revealed the depth of her transformation: **"Finally, the crossing sent over their people. It saves me so much trouble of having to go there. Funny, after all this time, you've... Months after you were needed, you finally come."**

[entity:7888222|Annie's] tragic story unfolded as she explained her family's fate and her spiritual journey into darkness. When orc raiders killed her family, she prayed desperately to [entity:7763134|Avacyn] for hope, [entity:7763138|Stendarr] for mercy, and even [entity:7763133|Lilith] for vengeance - but received no divine response. [entity:7763290|Arnor's] religious knowledge revealed the theological problem: [entity:7763133|Lilith] only grants targeted vengeance against specific wrongdoers, but the orcs who killed [entity:7888222|Annie's] family were already dead. This drove her to [entity:7763136|Diablo] worship, the only deity willing to grant pure hatred regardless of specifics.

Her plan had been methodical and terrifying: lure orcs to the ritual site, kill them to build an undead army, then **"assault the bridge itself"** - meaning [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing]. The party had arrived just as she neared completion of her vengeful scheme.

[entity:7888222|Annie] activated her ritual by stamping her foot, sending bloody red chains into each party member's chest. The **demonic curse** would drain their blood if they took damage and prevented escape from the ritual area. Simultaneously, **scarecrow constructs** animated from nearby hay bales, their heads bursting into blood-red magical fire that created auras of supernatural fear.

As the ritual combat began, the party noticed they had acquired an audience. Numerous orcs and goblins surrounded the battlefield, but rather than attacking, they began placing bets and pointing at different party members. [entity:7763294|Aurelia], [entity:7763296|Qotal], and [entity:7763290|Arnor] recognized this as classic orc warrior culture - they loved both fighting and watching impressive combat. With their current numbers, the orcs could easily overwhelm the party, but impressive performance might earn enough respect to survive the encounter.

The party adapted their tactics to include **"panache"** - flashy combat maneuvers designed to impress the orc spectators. [entity:7763294|Aurelia] discovered the scarecrows' weakness to fire damage and wielded a torch with acrobatic flair. [entity:7763296|Qotal] delivered devastating staff attacks while performing athletic displays. [entity:7763290|Arnor] successfully disrupted one of the demonic chains binding the party, freeing himself through religious knowledge and occult showmanship.

The turning point came when [entity:7763294|Aurelia] used her religious understanding to disrupt [entity:7888222|Annie's] protective mist with a passionate speech about [entity:7763137|Pharasma's] hatred of unnatural things. With her defenses down, [entity:7763296|Qotal] delivered the killing blow, but [entity:7888222|Annie's] death proved as dramatic as her life - the demonic chains wrapped around her corpse and dragged it into the ritual sigil before the magic finally dissipated.

The scarecrows collapsed into ash, blown away by the wind, and the watching orcs cheered their approval. The party had accumulated fifteen panache points through their impressive performance, exceeding all thresholds for orc respect. The large orc leader stepped forward, introducing himself as [entity:7888223|Grabnizog], and expressed genuine admiration for their fighting prowess. Rather than hostility, he invited them to **"come deep in forest"** for honorable combat at full strength, presenting them with a **Sapling Shield** as tribute to their warrior skills.

## Combat & Challenges

The perimeter battle tested the party's coordination against multiple enemy groups approaching from different directions. Orc archers and goblin cavalry required tactical positioning and combined spellcasting to overcome. The ritual combat added unique challenges with the demonic chains restricting movement and draining vitality, while scarecrow constructs resistant to piercing damage forced adaptation to fire-based tactics. The pressure of performing impressively for orc spectators created an additional layer of complexity, requiring flashy combat maneuvers alongside effective fighting.

## Discoveries & Lore

The session revealed the tragic progression from innocent farming family to [entity:7763136|Diablo] worship, demonstrating how divine abandonment can drive even good people to darkness. [entity:7888222|Annie's] theological journey through [entity:7763134|Avacyn], [entity:7763138|Stendarr], and [entity:7763133|Lilith] before settling on [entity:7763136|Diablo] illustrated the complex relationship between prayer, divine response, and moral corruption. The encounter with [entity:7888223|Grabnizog] revealed that orc culture values warrior prowess over simple brutality, opening diplomatic possibilities. The **Sapling Shield** represents both a magical item and a cultural artifact demonstrating cross-species respect for combat excellence.

## Next Steps

With [entity:7888222|Annie's] threat eliminated and unexpected diplomatic contact established with [entity:7888223|Grabnizog's] orc tribe, the party faces several paths forward. The massive **Jailor** creature remains active with captured victims, requiring urgent rescue attempts. [entity:7888223|Grabnizog's] invitation offers potential for building alliance with local orc tribes, though venturing into deep forest territories carries significant risks. The [entity:7888224|ritual site] may require proper cleansing by religious authorities to prevent future corruption. Back at [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing], numerous outstanding quests await their attention, including supply deliveries, shrine restoration, and the mysterious references to "Tessa" that appeared during their previous adventures.
