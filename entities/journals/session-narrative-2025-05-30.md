# Chapter 3 - Necromancer's Welcome

Dawn broke humid and heavy over [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing], the air already thick with the promise of summer's relentless heat. In the mess hall, condensation beaded on wooden beams as the reunited party gathered over porridge and small beer, their recent victories still fresh in mind and muscle.

"We slew the beast!" [entity:7763289|Alrik Grimmelstang] proclaimed to anyone within earshot, his wild hair seeming to defy both gravity and reason. "We killed the dragon! Returned with the treasure hoard!" [entity:7764103|Vidia] bobbed around his shoulder, her tiny light pulsing in apparent agreement.

[entity:7763294|Aurelia] reached across the table, pressing a small piece of cold iron against her palm. The metal's dull gleam caught the morning light as she extended her hand toward the excitable chef. "I'm Aurelia," she said simply, letting the iron speak its own truth about her nature.

[entity:7763289|Alrik's] eyes narrowed, then relaxed. The cold iron test—five gold pieces worth of insurance against fey trickery—had become second nature after centuries of pursuit. "Well then. Good to meet someone who takes proper precautions."

Their conversation drew the attention of [entity:7764195|Gaz], who wove between tables with practiced ease. The [entity:7763190|hobgoblin] server paused at their table, her expression brightening with the look of someone who recognized opportunity.

"New faces settling in, I see." She gestured toward the menu board where a crude drawing showed a fairy in a teacup with a firm circle-and-cross through it. "Though some faces aren't so welcome here anymore."

[entity:7763296|Qotal] tilted his scaled head. "The sign suggests... incidents?"

"Oh, you could say that." [entity:7764195|Gaz] leaned in conspiratorially. "Let's just say the wee folk and the bridge management have had their disagreements. But civilized folk like yourselves—that's different. Speaking of civilized, don't let anyone tell you all [entity:7763229|goblins] are the same. Those raiders out there?" She spat to the side. "Nothing like us hobs. We work honest jobs, contribute to society."

"Hobs?" [entity:7763295|Bruldin] asked, his scarred fingers drumming against his maul's handle.

"That's what we call ourselves—the civilized ones. I know people, if you need anything. Know a guy for everything, actually." Her smile revealed teeth filed less for war than for appearance. "Including some delivery work to my cousins' camps upriver, if you're interested when the next caravan comes through."

Before anyone could respond, [entity:7764102|Aelysh] appeared at the hall's entrance, her woodland garb still damp with morning dew. The [entity:7763217|Wood Elf] moved with the particular urgency of someone running short on both time and funds.

"Ah, the heroes of the hour," she said, approaching their table. "I hear the captain has a proposition for you, but I wondered... might you help me with a delicate matter?"

[entity:7763289|Alrik] squinted suspiciously. "You're not after my recipes, are you?"

"What? No, I need elderberries. Rare ones. That lecherous geezer Old Willy has some, but three flying little shits made off with them." [entity:7764102|Aelysh's] expression soured. "I need them for... well, let's say I need seeds, and those berries would help fund the purchase."

The party exchanged glances. [entity:7763296|Qotal's] nature knowledge surfaced—elderberries of the type she described were indeed legendary, possessing alchemical properties that made them worth their weight in silver.

"We'll consider it," [entity:7763294|Aurelia] said diplomatically. "After we see what the captain wants."

---

[entity:7764097|Captain Irka Spritzel's] office occupied the tower's middle floor, its windows offering commanding views of both river approaches. Maps covered every surface not claimed by ledgers or patrol reports. The [entity:7763200|Highland Dwarf] studied them as he spoke, not bothering with pleasantries.

"I'll be direct. We have a situation that needs handling before it becomes a problem." He gestured to a well-dressed man who'd been examining some sort of mechanical contraption in the corner. "This is [entity:7764196|Rosencrantz]. He'll explain the details."

The mechamagician turned, revealing features that suggested [entity:7763216|Iberian] ancestry and eyes that glittered with barely contained enthusiasm. "Ah, yes! The mansion clearance. You see, the previous military commander built himself quite the estate upstream. Twenty years in the making, finished seven or eight years ago. Beautiful work, really—I helped with some of the more intricate mechanisms."

"Get to the point," [entity:7764097|Irka] prompted.

"Yes, well. The commander died two, three years past. Natural causes, they say, though at his age and with his habits..." [entity:7764196|Rosencrantz] shrugged. "The property stood empty until last month when new owners purchased it. They arrive between the twelfth and fourteenth of Aestra-Orpheus."

"That's in six days," [entity:7763295|Bruldin] calculated.

"Precisely. We need the property cleared of any... lingering issues before the new owners take possession. Standard salvage rules apply—anything you find is yours, within reason."

[entity:7763296|Qotal] remained silent through most of the briefing, but as the others filed out, he lingered. "Captain, a moment?"

[entity:7764097|Irka] nodded, dismissing [entity:7764196|Rosencrantz] with a gesture.

"In my homeland, there stands a statue. Six, perhaps seven stories tall. A [entity:7763200|dwarf] warrior clutching a broken hammer." [entity:7763296|Qotal's] voice carried the weight of prophecy. "The whispers that guide me suggest its story ends somewhere near."

The captain's expression shifted—interest mixed with something else. "Broken hammer, you say? I'll... make inquiries. Such monuments aren't common."

As [entity:7763296|Qotal] departed, he noticed [entity:7763295|Bruldin] waiting in the hallway, the slayer's usual boisterousness replaced by thoughtful silence. Whatever the broken blade meant, it resonated with more than just [entity:7763296|the Slaan monk].

The settlement's rhythm over the next two days took on the peculiar quality of enforced rest. The bridge's authorities encouraged newcomers to establish themselves within the community before undertaking further work, a policy that gave the party time to deepen connections and gather information.

[entity:7763296|Qotal] found a shaded spot near the water where his lute's melodies could catch the river breeze. [entity:7763866|Lyn Chong] joined him there, sharing tea that tasted of distant mountains while they discussed the nature of divine whispers and earthly obligations. The elderly traveler's insights into [entity:7763144|Gia's] worship across different cultures proved unexpectedly profound.

[entity:7763289|Alrik], his curiosity piqued by his lengthy petrification, spent hours with [entity:7764196|Rosencrantz] in the [entity:7764199|island laboratory]. Between experiments with beakers and bizarre contraptions, they calculated his stone sleep at approximately one hundred and fifty years. The revelation left the chef unusually subdued, muttering about missed culinary innovations and lost recipe variations.

[entity:7763294|Aurelia's] vampiric nature demanded attention. She attended to her feeding needs with careful discretion, securing enough sustenance to keep the hunger at bay for some time. She spent her remaining hours with [entity:7764195|Gaz], learning the intricate web of [entity:7763229|goblin] politics and rumors that flowed through the bridge settlement like water through its pilings.

"The civilized camps upriver, they're cousins mostly," [entity:7764195|Gaz] explained over carefully watered wine. "But the raiders? They're getting organized. Used to be just tollgates and robbery. Now there's talk of something bigger. Someone's united several tribes."

[entity:7763290|Arnor's] investigations took a different path. His search for witch covens or kindred practitioners led him through the settlement's less-traveled ways. Near sunset, he discovered the [entity:7764201|Hades shrine] built into the bridge's very structure—a somber alcove where travelers left coins for the ferryman.

The shrine's caretaker, a severe woman in [entity:7763137|Pharasma's] colors, watched him examine the offerings. "Hades keeps the dead in their place," she said without prompting. "The purveyor of the undead, some call him. Though these days, with vampires buying property upstream..." She didn't finish the thought.

Finding no existing practitioners, [entity:7763290|Arnor] took matters into his own hands. As twilight painted the sky purple, he carved subtle witch marks into wood and stone—signals to those who knew how to read them. "I walk among you," the symbols declared. "Let us speak."

Later, checking on [entity:7763867|Natvig] through their familiar bond, he found the creature agitated but safe, wheeling through night skies with purpose [entity:7763290|the Norn] couldn't quite discern.

"Uncle's a difficult man," [entity:7764194|Sigrid] admitted as she showed [entity:7763290|Arnor] the better goods in the general store's back room. They'd been speaking [entity:7763223|Skald] for several minutes, the familiar rhythm of homeland speech warming them both like good mead.

"But [entity:7764100|Gierr] keeps the best honey in three territories. His mead..." She kissed her fingers. "Worth dealing with his moods."

"You fled [entity:7763178|Solstheim] too," [entity:7763290|Arnor] observed, not quite making it a question.

"Different reasons than yours, I'd wager. But yes. The homeland's beauty couldn't balance its... limitations." She pulled out a ledger, switching to practicalities. "The ring you mentioned—I can offer half value now, or you could wait for the caravan. They'll give you two-thirds, maybe three-quarters if you haggle."

"When do they arrive?"

"Few days, weather permitting. Though with what's brewing upstream..." She gestured vaguely north. "Routes aren't as predictable as they were."

They spent another hour planning an Old Lughnass festival for September's end, a taste of home in this frontier place. The irony wasn't lost on either—fleeing tradition only to recreate it elsewhere.

---

The morning of the mansion expedition dawned clear and hot. [entity:7764196|Rosencrantz] met them at the dock with a flat-bottomed boat that had seen better decades. "She'll hold," he assured them, though his tone suggested hope more than certainty.

The [entity:7764198|Von Carstein mansion] rose from its island perch like a Gothic fever dream. Three stories of imported stone and elaborate architectural flourishes that belonged in [entity:7763172|Astoria] more than this frontier. As they approached, movement in the upper windows suggested their clearance work would be more than simple housekeeping.

"Skeps," [entity:7763294|Aurelia] identified the creatures scrambling across the mansion's grounds. The small undead things—like [entity:7763229|goblins] drained of life and purpose—clutched crude weapons as they formed rough battle lines.

From the second-floor balcony, a figure in tattered robes began weaving patterns in the air. Where his gestures passed, fallen skeps twitched and rose again, their movements even more unnatural than before.

"A gods-damned necromancer," [entity:7763295|Bruldin] growled, battle fury already rising in his blood. "In broad daylight. No respect for proper battle."

[entity:7763296|Qotal] didn't wait for further assessment. The monk launched himself at the building's facade, scaled fingers finding purchase on decorative stonework. His ascent drew the necromancer's attention—and his defensive spells.

Below, chaos erupted. Skeps poured from doorways and cellar windows in waves. [entity:7763289|Alrik's] needle gun spat magical projectiles while [entity:7764103|Vidia] darted between enemies, her light disorienting their already-poor vision. [entity:7764102|Aelysh's] vine whips created a green barrier that the undead struggled to breach, buying precious moments for coordinated strikes.

[entity:7763290|Arnor] flanked wide, his magic striking at unexpected angles. Each fallen skep that didn't rise again was a small victory, but the necromancer's power seemed inexhaustible.

Then [entity:7763296|Qotal] reached the balcony.

The monk's leap from windowsill to balcony rail would have been impossible for anyone lacking his training. His strike—powered by momentum and righteous purpose—took the necromancer in the chest. They tumbled together in a tangle of limbs and torn robes.

Without their animator, the remaining undead faltered. The party's concentrated assault cleared the grounds with brutal efficiency. Even the few skeps that had sheltered in the garden gazebo couldn't escape [entity:7763295|Bruldin's] methodical advance.

Inside, the mansion revealed its secrets reluctantly. Hidden passages yielded treasures both monetary and mystical. But in the study, among correspondence and contracts, [entity:7763294|Aurelia] found documents that chilled even her undead blood.

"[entity:7764193|Osanna Von Carstein]," she read aloud. "The new owner is from the [entity:7764192|Von Carstein] line."

The name hung in the air like incense at a funeral. Even those unfamiliar with [entity:7763172|Astoria's] politics recognized the weight of an ancient vampire house extending its reach into frontier territories.

"The old bloodlines are moving," [entity:7763294|Aurelia] said quietly. "The question is why here? Why now?"

[entity:7763296|Qotal] gathered scattered papers, his scholarly instincts overriding caution. Maps of trade routes, lists of names both familiar and foreign, references to something called [entity:7764191|the Consortium]—a partnership between [entity:7763865|Iron Kingdoms], [entity:7763200|dwarven] interests, and [entity:7763168|Jade Kingdoms] merchants.

"Bridge building," [entity:7763295|Bruldin] summarized with dwarf practicality. "Not just the physical kind. Commercial. Political."

"And now vampiric," [entity:7763290|Arnor] added.

They loaded their boat with everything portable and valuable, but the weight of knowledge pressed heavier than any gold. As they poled back toward [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing], the mansion stood empty behind them—cleared of its immediate threats but pregnant with darker promises.

"The captain needs to know," [entity:7763296|Qotal] said, breaking the silence that had settled over their return journey.

"She knows," [entity:7763294|Aurelia] countered. "The question is what she'll do about it. What any of us can do about it."

[entity:7763289|Alrik], for once, had no jokes about dragons or treasure hoards. Even [entity:7764103|Vidia's] light seemed dimmer as they approached the bridge's familiar shadows. The afternoon sun beat down mercilessly, but each of them felt a different kind of chill—the cold touch of ancient powers reaching across centuries and continents to claim their place in this new world.

The bridge's mundane bustle—merchants hawking, workers hauling, children playing between the pilings—seemed both more precious and more fragile than it had that morning. They'd cleared a house of its haunts, but in doing so had uncovered a truth that would haunt them far longer than any skep or skeleton.

[entity:7764097|Captain Irka Spritzel] waited in his office, maps already spread with new markings, new concerns. As the party began their report, [entity:7763295|Bruldin] noticed he'd placed a paperweight on one particular document—a sketch of a broken blade that looked remarkably like the one from [entity:7763296|Qotal's] vision.

The captain listened to their account in silence, his expression darkening with each revelation. When they finished, he pushed the papers aside and steepled his fingers, eyes already calculating angles and contingencies. Outside his window, the bridge bustled on, unaware that old bloodlines had extended their reach into these frontier waters.
