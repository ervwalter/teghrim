# Annie

Annie was the young adult daughter of a farming family who turned to Diablo worship after her family was killed by orc raiders and her prayers to benevolent deities went unanswered. Consumed by hatred and desperation, she used dark magic to create an army of undead orcs and scarecrow constructs with the goal of attacking Teghrim's Crossing in revenge for the settlement's failure to protect her family.

## Description

### Physical Appearance

A young woman transformed by months of dark magic and hatred. During her final confrontation, she manifested within red mist at the center of her ritual circle, protected by supernatural defenses. Her exact appearance was obscured by the magical aura surrounding her, but she retained enough of her humanity to be recognizable as the missing farmer's daughter.

### Personality & Demeanor

Consumed by bitter hatred toward Teghrim's Crossing and those she perceived as having abandoned her family. Expressed scorn and anger at the delayed response to her family's plight, demonstrating deep resentment at divine abandonment. Her turn to Diablo worship reflected complete moral corruption driven by grief and desire for revenge.

### Abilities & Skills

Powerful necromancer capable of creating and controlling undead constructs from local materials. Mastered demonic chain magic that could bind enemies and drain their life force. Skilled in ritual magic, able to create permanent magical circles and animate scarecrow guardians. Possessed Charlatan's Gloves granting enhanced thievery and telekinetic projectile abilities.

## Background

Daughter of a pioneer family that established a homestead in the dangerous eastern territories beyond Teghrim's Crossing. When orc raiders attacked and killed her family, she survived wounded and prayed desperately to multiple deities for aid - Avacyn (angel of hope), Stendarr (compassion and mercy), and even Lilith (vengeance) - but received no divine response. This abandonment drove her to Diablo worship as the only deity willing to grant her the hatred she needed for revenge.
