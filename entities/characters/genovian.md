# Genovian

Genovian is an Espada (also called Rhonqar) who once lived in the elevated waterfall region near [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing], associated with the positive ley line nexus in that area. Though she should have departed before the last Breath of the Nexus, her emanations—one-eyed bird-like manifestations—continue to appear throughout the region, sometimes observing peacefully and sometimes turning hostile.

## Description

### Physical Appearance

Genovian's true form remains unseen by the party, though as an Espada she is "highly related to elements but not true elemental," with particular connection to mist. Her manifestations take the form of one-eyed bird-like creatures.

### Personality & Demeanor

Described by the [entity:7764101|Willow Dryad] as "a fairly kind person" who taught songs to young forest creatures long ago. Her emanations' current hostile behavior suggests either corruption, distress, or loss of control over her manifestations.

### Abilities & Skills

Creates emanations—one-eyed bird manifestations that can observe from a distance, transform into mist, and attack when hostile. These emanations can be calmed by playing a mystical tune she taught to forest creatures. Her nature as an Espada connects her deeply to elemental forces and ley line energies.

## Background

## Current Status

Location unknown. According to the [entity:7764101|Willow Dryad], Genovian should have departed from the waterfall region long ago, yet her emanations persist. Whether she remains hidden in the area, is trapped, corrupted, or departed leaving autonomous manifestations behind remains a central mystery.

## Secrets & Mysteries

Why do Genovian's emanations persist when she should have departed before the last Breath of the Nexus? Is she still in the waterfall region but hidden? Has something prevented her departure? Are the emanations' hostile actions under her control or have they become autonomous? An ancient tree ent in the [entity:TBD|Enchanted Forest] would know exactly where she lived.
