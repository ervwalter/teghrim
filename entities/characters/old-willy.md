# Old Willy

Old Willy is an eccentric elderberry farmer living in isolation beyond [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing]. Suspicious of strangers and protective of his prized elderberries, he has survived the frontier's dangers through paranoia and ingenuity, though his past includes a traumatic two-month captivity by hobs.

## Description

### Physical Appearance

An older, weathered man whose appearance and odor suggest limited concern for personal hygiene. His cabin and surroundings show signs of frontier living, with various defensive measures against wildlife and intruders. The strong odor emanating from him is notable enough to mask other scents in the area.

### Personality & Demeanor

Highly suspicious and immediately defensive when strangers approach, grabbing his pitchfork at first sight of visitors. Protective to the point of paranoia about his elderberries, convinced everyone wants to steal them. Rambles extensively when engaged in conversation, often losing track of his original point. Despite his eccentricity, shows practical frontier survival skills.

### Abilities & Skills

Skilled elderberry cultivation, maintaining bushes covered with bells and strings as alarm systems. Possesses at least one magical rune that provides protection against ghosts and incorporeal beings. Survival skills sufficient to escape hob captivity and maintain an isolated homestead in dangerous territory.

## Background

A frontier settler who established his homestead in the wilderness beyond [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing]. His isolation appears partly voluntary and partly due to poor relations with townspeople.
