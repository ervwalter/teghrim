# One-Eyed Figure

The One-Eyed Figure is a mysterious flying bird-like creature who observed the party's battle against Gore and the bulvak raiders from the treeline. This enigmatic avian watcher vanished without explanation when noticed, leaving only questions in their wake.

## Description

### Physical Appearance

A bird-like creature distinguished by a single glowing eye that stood out even from a distance. The flying entity maintained position perched in the treeline shadows, its avian form suggesting a creature unlike any normal bird. Dark feathers or wing membranes were glimpsed, but the creature's exact species remains unknown. The single eye dominated what should have been a face, glowing with an otherworldly light.

### Personality & Demeanor

Demonstrated cautious observation rather than intervention, choosing to watch the battle unfold without participating. The immediate disappearance when spotted suggests either wariness of discovery or completion of their surveillance purpose.

### Abilities & Skills

Capable of remaining undetected throughout an intense combat until the battle's conclusion. As a flying creature, it could maintain surveillance from high perches and relocate silently. The vanishing ability displayed when noticed indicates either exceptional stealth, magical abilities, or supernatural nature. The glowing eye suggests enhanced perception or otherworldly origin, while its avian nature allows for swift, silent movement through the forest canopy.

## Background

Nothing is known about this creature's identity, purpose, or allegiance. Its presence at this specific battle raises questions about whether it was tracking the party, the bulvaks, or had some other interest in the events. The bird-like form suggests it may be a familiar, messenger, or independent entity.

## Relationships

- **Unknown**: No established connections to any known individuals or factions
- **[entity:7763289|Alrik Grimmelstang]**: Alrik's comment "They're following me. They want my recipe" suggests possible connection to fey pursuing his culinary secrets

## Notable History

## Current Status

Whereabouts unknown. Having completed whatever purpose brought it to observe the battle, the creature vanished without trace. Whether it continues to monitor the party from the skies or has flown on to other interests remains a mystery.

## Secrets & Mysteries

The creature's identity, allegiance, and purpose remain completely unknown. Its avian nature raises questions about whether it serves as a familiar to some unseen master or acts independently. The connection between its surveillance and recent events - whether related to the party's activities, the bulvak raids, or [entity:7763289|Alrik's] secret recipes - has yet to be revealed.
