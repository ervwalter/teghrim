# Willow Dryad

As one of the three forest guardians protecting access to the [entity:TBD|Enchanted Forest], she tests worthy travelers and grants protective lanterns to those who prove themselves. A repository of ancient forest knowledge, she remembers Genovian the Espada from long ago and senses disturbing changes in the forest's natural balance.

What exactly is the "something wrong" she senses in the forest?
