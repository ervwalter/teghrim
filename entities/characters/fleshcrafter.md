# The Fleshcrafter

The Fleshcrafter is a powerful female necromancer who operates from the depths of Skull Rock dungeon beneath the cursed stone formation. A master of necromancy and flesh magic, she creates undead constructs and commands the Jailor as her gatherer, collecting victims for her dark experiments.

## Description

### Physical Appearance

A large, tall creature with no visible eyes and horns protruding from her head in a covering pattern across her skull. Her appearance draws comparison to Pan's Labyrinth's Pale Man or the Mouth of Sauron from Lord of the Rings - unsettling and otherworldly. She wears a gruesome cloak fashioned from flayed skins of various creatures, displaying all different colors and sizes, mostly from medium-sized beings, with some that could be human. The cloak serves as both garment and trophy, testament to her victims.

### Personality & Demeanor

Speaks in a measured, somewhat formal manner with frequent verbal pauses. Initially converses in Necral before switching to Common when addressing intruders. Shows irritation at having her work interrupted. Demonstrates calculated cruelty, offering victims the chance to explain themselves before subjecting them to slow and agonizing death. When met with sarcasm, responds with cold dismissal rather than anger.

### Abilities & Skills

Master necromancer capable of raising skeleton armies from bone piles through simple commands and animating undead troops from flayed corpses. Speaks both Necral and Common fluently. Creates undead constructs including meat puppets, flesh golems, skeleton warriors, and troops of fleshless walkers and crawlers. Flays victims alive as part of her dark craft, using the skins as cloaks and animating the flayed corpses as undead servants. Commands the Jailor construct as her "gatherer," using it to collect living subjects for experimentation. Draws power from a soul orb anchored in her ritual chamber, using it to channel negative energy bursts affecting entire rooms. Can inflict stupefied conditions on multiple targets simultaneously through necrotic magic pulses.

## Background

Established her operation within Skull Rock dungeon, transforming the ancient tunnels into a necromantic laboratory and fortress. Her exact origins remain unknown, though her mastery of death magic and flesh crafting suggests extensive study and practice of forbidden arts.

## Relationships

- **The Jailor**: Her "gatherer" - massive construct she commanded to capture victims, now destroyed by adventurers
- **Unknown Collaborators**: Mentioned "we" before correcting to "I," suggesting possible allies or co-conspirators
- **Skull Rock Dungeon**: Her domain and laboratory, now compromised by party intrusion
- **Soul Orb**: Draws power from this anchored magical artifact in her ritual chamber
- **[entity:7763296|Vilis Gavrik]**: Superior in the Necarch network who directed establishment of Skull Rock soul well site
- **Necarch Network**: Subordinate member operating field installation under regional coordination

## Notable History

- **The Dungeon Establishment**: Took control of Skull Rock, establishing necromantic laboratory beneath the cursed stone formation
- **The Jailor Control**: Bound or created the massive construct to serve as gatherer of victims
- **The First Party Encounter**: Confronted adventurers who penetrated her dungeon security, attempted to capture them using raised skeleton army
- **The Skeleton Army**: Raised five skeleton warriors from bone pile in response to party's sarcastic "door-to-door salesmen" greeting, ordering them to capture intruders alive
- **The Jailor's Defeat**: Lost her gatherer construct when party destroyed it using anti-Jailor bombs and combined combat tactics
- **The Meat Puppet Ambush**: Set nine meat puppet constructs to ambush intruders in the ritual chamber, though all were eventually destroyed
- **The Undead Troops**: Deployed fleshless walker and crawler troops alongside her personal combat magic in final confrontation
- **The Soul Orb Connection**: Drew power from soul orb in her chamber to unleash necrotic energy bursts and stupefying magic on the party
- **The Tactical Retreat**: When Alrik successfully cast Dispel Magic on her soul orb connection, reversing the energy flow to positive instead of negative, she shrieked in pain and fled through a secret door, escaping the party

## Current Status

Escaped through secret passage after her soul orb connection was disrupted by Alrik's Dispel Magic. Her Jailor construct has been destroyed, her undead forces defeated, and her lair compromised. Whereabouts unknown, though she likely remains somewhere within or near Skull Rock. The party explored her personal quarters and collected correspondence written in Necral, stone tomes, magic tomes, and other research materials that may reveal more about her operations. Her correspondence revealing connections to [entity:7763296|Vilis Gavrik] and [entity:7763297|Goldgrin] was recovered by the party and is currently being translated from Necral by [entity:7763294|Aurelia].

## Secrets & Mysteries

The identity of the "we" she mentioned before correcting herself remains unknown. The contents of the large pouch or cloth she was dragging when first encountered have not been revealed. Her true origins, the extent of her powers, and her ultimate goals are yet to be discovered. Whether she created the Jailor or merely bound it to her service requires further investigation.
