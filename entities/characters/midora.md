# Midora

Midora was a human female from the bridge construction era who became the unwilling victim of Echin's obsessive magical binding. Trapped as a spirit for decades by his unrequited love ritual, she was finally freed when the party broke the supernatural bonds that had created recurring storms throughout the region.

## Description

### Physical Appearance

In life, Midora was depicted as a beautiful woman, immortalized in the magical mural that became her prison. As a spirit, she appeared as a hunched, cloaked figure near the stone circles, her form shrouded and mysterious. When she revealed herself to the party, her true distress and gratitude became apparent.

### Personality & Demeanor

Midora demonstrated grace under extreme duress, maintaining her dignity despite decades of supernatural imprisonment. She showed both righteous anger at her captor and genuine gratitude toward her liberators. Her ability to communicate through wind magic suggested both supernatural adaptation and strength of will.

### Abilities & Skills

As a trapped spirit, Midora possessed wind magic that she used for communication and defense, including the ability to cast gust of wind spells. Her supernatural nature allowed her to persist as a conscious entity despite being bound against her will for decades.

## Background

Midora lived during the bridge construction period and was approached by Echin with what she believed were genuine romantic intentions. When she was brought to the forest ruins and discovered his true obsessive nature, she became the victim of a binding ritual that trapped her spirit for approximately two decades.

## Current Status

At peace. Successfully freed from her supernatural prison when the party broke Echin's binding ritual. She thanked her liberators before departing on the wind to whatever lies beyond, finally able to rest after decades of unwilling captivity.

## Secrets & Mysteries

The local legend that interpreted the recurring storms as "her tears" proved remarkably accurate, suggesting that her emotional state while trapped influenced the supernatural weather patterns that resulted from the binding ritual.
