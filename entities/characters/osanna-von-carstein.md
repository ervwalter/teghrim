# Osanna Von Carstein

Osanna Von Carstein is a vampire noble and member of an ancient vampire dynasty from the [entity:7763172|Astoria] continent who has recently acquired property near [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing].

## Description

Her features are classically aristocratic with high cheekbones and full, crimson lips often curved in a knowing smile that reveals the barest hint of fangs. She dresses in the height of gothic elegance - a black and red corset dress with white puffy sleeves that expose her shoulders, combining sensuality with noble refinement. Red gemstone earrings dangle from her ears, catching light like drops of blood. Her eyes hold centuries of secrets and predatory calculation, while her entire bearing exudes the confidence of ancient nobility. Even in casual moments, she maintains the poise of one born to rule, making it clear why the Von Carstein name commands both fear and respect.

Harbors strong disdain for arcane magic and "hoity-toity wizards" with their towers and superior attitudes, preferring other forms of power.
