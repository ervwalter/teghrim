# Viktor von Carstein

Viktor von Carstein is the founder of the [entity:7764192|Von Carstein vampire house] and the current vampire elder who maintains balance between the various vampire clans. As one of the awakened elder vampires, his presence and authority prevent open warfare between competing vampire dynasties, though he cannot prevent all conflicts between bloodlines like the Von Carstein and the [entity:8244549|Necarch].

### Abilities & Skills

## Background
