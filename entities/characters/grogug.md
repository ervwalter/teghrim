# Grogug

Grogug is a troll who guards the massive waterfall near [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing], charging tolls for passage up the treacherous stone stairs carved into the cliff face. Despite his mercenary nature and dark humor about eating travelers, he proves surprisingly amenable to alternative forms of payment and maintains friendly relations with the local [entity:7766459|hob] communities.

## Description

### Physical Appearance

A massive troll with the typical regenerative abilities and imposing stature of his kind. Lives behind the waterfall itself, emerging to confront travelers attempting to ascend the dangerous stone stairs. Currently missing one arm after an encounter with [entity:8244510|the Fleshcrafter], though his regeneration will restore it within 1-2 months.

### Personality & Demeanor

Gregarious but mercenary, with a dark sense of humor about his dietary preferences. Switches between Jotun and Common languages, crediting the local hobs for teaching him the latter. Despite his threats about eating travelers, shows surprising flexibility in accepting alternative payments and maintains cordial relationships with those who treat him fairly. Demonstrates practical pragmatismâ€”when [entity:8244510|the Fleshcrafter] cut off his arm, he ate it rather than let it go to waste.

### Abilities & Skills

Speaks both Jotun and Common fluently. Controls access to the highland plateau above the waterfall through physical intimidation and toll collection. Demonstrates typical troll regeneration and strength. Has developed a taste for baked goods, particularly cake.

## Background

Established himself as toll keeper at the waterfall, learning Common from the local [entity:7766459|hob] settlements. His position controls a critical access point to the highland regions where various mysteries and dangers await.

## Relationships

- **[entity:7764197|Queen Zelinda]**: Provided cake through Mendel to ensure safe passage for the party
- **[entity:7764195|Gaz]**: Maintains friendly relations, grants free passage to her friends
- **Local Hob Communities**: Taught him Common language, maintain working relationship
- **The Party**: Accepted cake as toll payment, granted free passage up and down

## Notable History

- **The Language Learning**: Taught Common by local hobs, showing unusual cooperation between species
- **The Toll Establishment**: Set up lucrative position charging "1 gold per person or 1 person as meal"
- **The Cake Payment**: Accepted special cake from Queen Zelinda/Mendel instead of usual toll
- **The Free Pass**: Granted party free passage up and down due to friendship with [entity:7764195|Gaz]
- **The Fleshcrafter Encounter** (Aestra-Orpheus 30th-31st): Tall creepy woman with no eyes and weird horns refused to pay toll, sliced off Grogug's arm when he demanded payment. Grogug ate his own severed arm ("can't let a good arm go to waste"). Will regenerate in 1-2 months. Offers free passage "once or twice" if party brings back the Fleshcrafter's arm.
- **The Pastry Toll** (Orpheus 5th): Accepted Mendel's pastries from party as alternative payment, granting round-trip passage to Highland Uplands

## Current Status

Actively guarding the waterfall passage and collecting tolls from travelers attempting to reach the highland plateau, despite currently missing one arm. Maintains his position behind the waterfall, emerging to negotiate with those seeking passage. His acceptance of cake and pastries as payment suggests potential for creative negotiations with future travelers. Seeks vengeance against [entity:8244510|the Fleshcrafter] and offers free passage to those who bring back her arm.
