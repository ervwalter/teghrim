# Aurelia

## Overview

Aurelia is a dhampir investigator pursuing a mysterious case on behalf of "a friend." Her vampiric heritage grants her enhanced combat abilities and survival instincts, while her investigative skills and artistic talents make her a valuable asset to any adventuring party.

## Description

### Physical Appearance

Aurelia carries herself with the unmistakable bearing of old nobility, her dhampir heritage evident in her pale complexion and subtle predatory grace. Her movements are precise and controlled, whether she's crafting delicate origami animals or unleashing swift violence with her hand crossbow. Though she dresses practically for her work as an investigator, the quality of her gear and refined manner of speech betray her aristocratic background. Her enhanced senses and vampiric nature manifest in small waysâ€”the occasional glimpse of slightly elongated canines, the way she seems to track movement others miss, and her comfort operating in darkness.

### Personality & Demeanor

Practical and direct in her approach to problems, with a philosophical streak evidenced by her comment about character being more important than skin color. Demonstrates artistic creativity through origami crafting while engaging in conversation.

### Abilities & Skills

Expert markswoman with hand crossbow, capable of critical hits that dispatch enemies instantly. Possesses vampiric abilities including blood consumption from defeated foes to sustain herself, rolling blood tokens during downtime (recently achieved 12). Skilled in recall knowledge and tactical analysis of opponents. Creates intricate origami animals as a form of artistic expression.
