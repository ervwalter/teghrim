# Aurelia

Aurelia is a dhampir investigator pursuing a mysterious case on behalf of "a friend." Her vampiric heritage grants her enhanced combat abilities and survival instincts, while her investigative skills and artistic talents make her a valuable asset to any adventuring party.

## Description

### Physical Appearance

Porcelain-pale skin and crimson eyes immediately mark Aurelia's dhampir heritage. Her sleek black hair is cut in a sharp bob with straight bangs, framing an elegant face adorned with dark lipstick and multiple piercings. She dresses in gothic punk fashion - a black leather jacket worn over elaborate corsets and straps, combining practicality with dark elegance. A choker featuring a small skull pendant encircles her throat, while cross earrings dangle from pointed ears. Her outfit incorporates gold-scaled armor pieces that catch the light, suggesting both protection and style. She holds a blade with casual confidence, her entire appearance balancing aristocratic refinement with dangerous edge. Small details like her slightly elongated canines and the predatory grace of her movements constantly remind observers of her vampiric nature.

Possesses vampiric abilities including blood consumption from defeated foes to sustain herself, rolling blood tokens during downtime (recently achieved 12).
