## Description

### Physical Appearance

Porcelain-pale skin and crimson eyes immediately mark Aurelia's dhampir heritage. Her sleek black hair is cut in a sharp bob with straight bangs, framing an elegant face adorned with dark lipstick and multiple piercings.

A choker featuring a small skull pendant encircles her throat, while cross earrings dangle from pointed ears. Her outfit incorporates gold-scaled armor pieces that catch the light, suggesting both protection and style. She holds a blade with casual confidence, her entire appearance balancing aristocratic refinement with dangerous edge. Small details like her slightly elongated canines and the predatory grace of her movements constantly remind observers of her vampiric nature.
