# Echin

Echin was a human male from the bridge construction era who became obsessed with Midora and used dark magical rituals to trap both their spirits for decades. His unrequited infatuation led to a tragic binding that created recurring supernatural storms until the party freed both spirits from their eternal prison.

## Description

### Physical Appearance

In his ghostly manifestation, Echin appeared as a middle-aged human male in his 30s wearing simple commoner's clothes. Despite being deceased for decades, he maintained a solid, corporeal appearance that initially fooled observers into thinking he was still alive. His true nature as a restless spirit only became apparent during combat.

### Personality & Demeanor

Echin displayed obsessive and possessive tendencies, believing his feelings justified magical coercion. Even as a ghost, he remained delusional about his relationship with Midora, claiming she was "with him" despite her obvious distress. He wandered the ruins compulsively and became violently defensive when his magical mural was threatened.

### Abilities & Skills

As a ghost, Echin possessed supernatural abilities including a frightful moan that could terrify multiple opponents simultaneously and ghostly hand attacks that drained life force through void damage. He was tied to the magical mural he created, which served as both his anchor to the material plane and the source of the binding ritual.

## Background

Echin lived during the bridge construction period approximately two decades before the current events. He became infatuated with Midora and lured her to forest ruins with promises of romance, but when his feelings weren't reciprocated, he performed a magical ritual binding her spirit to a mural he had created.

## Relationships

- **Midora**: Object of his obsessive infatuation. He magically bound her spirit when she didn't return his feelings, trapping them both for decades
- **The Party**: Encountered them as investigators of the supernatural storms his binding ritual created

## Notable History

- **The False Romance**: Lured Midora to forest ruins with "tales of love" during the bridge construction era
- **The Binding Ritual**: Used dark magic to trap Midora's spirit in a mural when she rejected his advances, simultaneously binding himself to the location
- **The Storm Creation**: His magical binding caused recurring supernatural storms that plagued the region for decades
- **The Final Confrontation**: Fought the investigating party when they discovered the truth and threatened his mural
- **The Liberation**: Destroyed when the party successfully completed a divine ritual to break the magical binding, allowing time to catch up to his long-deceased form

## Current Status

Eliminated. The divine ritual performed by the party broke the magical binding that kept his spirit anchored to the material plane, allowing time to rapidly age his form until he crumbled to dust. Both he and Midora were freed from their supernatural prison.

## Secrets & Mysteries

The exact nature of the magical ritual Echin used to create the binding remains unknown, though it involved the mural he painted of Midora and was powerful enough to affect local weather patterns for decades.
