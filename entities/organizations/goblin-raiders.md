# Goblin Raiders

## Overview
The Goblin Raiders are organized bands of goblins, orcs, and other creatures that control territory along trade routes, demanding tolls from passing caravans. Their hierarchical structure and tactical coordination represent a significant evolution from typical goblin disorganization.

## Description
### Structure
Mixed-species raiding bands organized under orc leadership with goblins serving as primary fighters and snotlings as scouts. Clear succession protocols exist, with field promotions occurring when leaders fall.

### Leadership
Orc war leaders command respect through physical dominance while goblins maintain tactical positions and specialized roles. Leadership succession appears to follow merit-based advancement during combat.

### Methods
- **Toll Collection**: Claiming territory and demanding payment from caravans
- **Scout Networks**: Using snotlings for reconnaissance and intelligence gathering
- **Combined Arms**: Coordinating different creature types including spider-mounted units
- **Intimidation Tactics**: Leveraging fearsome reputation to avoid unnecessary conflict

## Background
Recent organization of traditionally chaotic goblin tribes under stronger leadership, possibly in response to increased caravan traffic and trade route profitability.

## Notable Members
- **Large Orc** (deceased): Former leader killed at caravanserai
- **Goblin #6**: Field-promoted leader who died shouting "Viva la revolucion!"

## Activities
- **Territory Control**: Claiming sections of trade routes as their domain
- **Toll Enforcement**: Extracting payment from passing merchants
- **Raiding Operations**: Attacking caravans that refuse to pay or negotiate
- **Advanced Tactics**: Employing spider cavalry and coordinated ambushes

## Relationships
- **Trade Caravans**: Primary targets for toll collection and raiding
- **Local Settlements**: Ongoing threat to frontier communities
- **Other Raider Groups**: Possible coordination with similar organizations

## Notable History
- **The [entity:7763869|Caravanserai] Incident**: Major assault on fortified caravan resulted in orc leader's death
- **The Spider Cavalry Attacks**: Deployment of mounted goblins on giant spiders with squig support
- **The Revolutionary Call**: Dying goblin leader's cry suggests broader organizational ideology

## Current Status
Leadership disrupted by recent losses but organizational structure appears to remain intact. The revolutionary rhetoric suggests political motivation beyond simple banditry.
