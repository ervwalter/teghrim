# Necarch Network

The Necarch Network is a lich faction operating an extensive soul well infrastructure across the frontier regions, trapping living victims' souls for necromantic purposes. This organized undead conspiracy represents one of the most significant supernatural threats to the settlements surrounding [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing].

## Description

### Structure & Organization

Hierarchical organization with clear chain of command extending from high-ranking coordinators like [entity:7763297|Goldgrin] down through regional operators like [entity:7763296|Vilis Gavrik] to field necromancers like [entity:8244510|the Fleshcrafter]. The network maintains written correspondence in Necral to coordinate operations across multiple sites and territories.

### Operational Methods

Creates and maintains soul wells - cursed sites that trap the souls of living victims for necromantic power. Victims' souls are drawn from their bodies, creating cursed corruption that spreads through the location. The soul well process technically transforms victims into undead, with profound religious implications for followers of [entity:7763137|Pharasma] and [entity:7763148|Hades].

### Geographical Scope

Operates multiple cursed sites across the region, with confirmed operations west of Rothurst River. Known sites include [entity:8051165|Skull Rock] beneath the cursed stone formation in the Weeping Woods. The full extent of the network remains unknown.

## Background

Established infrastructure of soul well sites across frontier territories, suggesting long-term strategic planning and significant resources. The organization's bureaucratic efficiency and written coordination indicate sophisticated management beyond typical undead operations.

## Current Status

Network continues operations despite disruption of [entity:8051165|Skull Rock] site. The party knows how soul wells are created but not how to destroy them, leaving the threat largely unaddressed. [entity:7763296|Vilis Gavrik] remains at large with unknown number of additional soul well sites still operational.

## Secrets & Mysteries

The ultimate purpose of the soul well network, the total number of operational sites, the location of [entity:7763296|Vilis Gavrik] and [entity:7763297|Goldgrin], the method for destroying soul wells, the source of the organization's resources and coordination, and whether the network extends beyond the frontier regions are all unknown questions requiring further investigation.
