# The Jailor

The Jailor is a massive, unique undead-construct hybrid creature standing over twenty feet tall that roams the frontier territories, capturing people alive in a cage built into its chest. This horrifying giant combines aspects of undead animation with constructed resilience, making it a formidable threat to travelers and settlers in remote areas.

## Description

### Physical Appearance

A colossal, nightmarish figure towering over twenty feet in height with a skeletal, emaciated frame draped in tattered robes and chains. Its most horrifying feature is the massive iron cage built directly into its ribcage - large enough to hold multiple human-sized captives - clearly visible through gaps in its decaying flesh and clothing. The creature's skull-like head looms high above, adorned with curved horns or bone protrusions, giving it a demonic appearance. Rusted chains and shackles hang from various points on its enormous body, many trailing all the way to the ground, creating an ominous rattling sound as it moves. Its massive arms end in clawed hands easily capable of grasping human victims, while its lower body appears to merge into a writhing mass of bones, chains, and tortured souls. The entire creature has a sickly greenish-pale coloration with areas of decay and corruption visible throughout. Its footprints measure approximately a foot and a half in circumference and appear misshapen, leaving behind thick black substance that drains color from nearby objects.

### Personality & Demeanor

Driven by an singular compulsion to capture living beings rather than kill them. Demonstrates tactical awareness by using non-lethal damage to incapacitate targets for collection. Shows no communication or negotiation capability, operating with relentless mechanical purpose.

### Abilities & Skills

**Combat Capabilities**: Exceptional physical strength capable of dealing massive non-lethal damage through melee attacks. Can throw chunks of its own body as projectile weapons. Creates noxious auras that affect nearby enemies.

**Defensive Properties**: Immune to death effects, disease, mental effects, paralysis, poison, and unconscious conditions. Possesses significant damage resistance but demonstrates weakness to positive energy and slashing damage.

**Special Abilities**: Moves at high speed while ignoring difficult terrain. Leaves cursed black substance footprints made of negative energy that drain color from surroundings and explode when exposed to divine light.

## Background

The origin and creator of this unique creature remain unknown. Its existence suggests either powerful necromantic experimentation or the manifestation of some dark supernatural force. The creature's purpose appears focused entirely on capture rather than destruction.

## Relationships

- **Captured Victims**: Holds people alive in its chest cage for unknown purposes
- **The Search Party**: Encountered and escaped from Arnor, Aurelia, Alrik, and Sylvia
- **Unknown Creator**: Some entity or force responsible for its existence and compulsions

## Notable History

- **The Caravan Attack**: Attacked and destroyed wagons, capturing the occupants while leaving no trace of their escape
- **The Forest Encounter**: Battled the search party in a forest clearing, knocking Arnor and Aurelia unconscious
- **The Tactical Retreat**: Fled at high speed when its chest cage became full, unable to capture additional victims
- **The Cursed Trail**: Left behind footprints of negative energy substance that explodes when exposed to divine power

## Current Status

At large in the frontier territories east of Teghrim's Crossing, presumably with victims still trapped in its chest cage. The creature's location and activities remain unknown, representing an ongoing threat to travelers and isolated settlements.

## Secrets & Mysteries

The identity of its creator, the ultimate purpose of the captured victims, the creature's base of operations, and its connection to other mysterious events in the region all remain unknown. The relationship between the Jailor and the Diablo ritual discovered at the abandoned farm raises disturbing questions about coordinated dark activities.
