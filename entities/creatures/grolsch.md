# Grolsch

Grolsch are large wooly creatures resulting from the hybridization of yetis and ogres. These gorilla-like beings occupy the [entity:8248838|Island Dwarven Ruins] in Waterfall Lake, demonstrating intelligence sufficient for toolmaking, cooking, and primitive society while maintaining the savage nature of their parent species.

## Description

### Physical Appearance

Large wooly creatures resembling gorillas, covered in thick fur suited for cold mountain environments. Their size varies by rank—elite individuals ("Big'un" and lower numbers) are substantially larger than normal and weak members. The thick wooly coat betrays their yeti heritage, while their ogre-like build grants them formidable strength and stature.

### Behavior & Intelligence

Intelligent enough to construct camps, cook food, and craft tools like slings for hurling projectiles. Their intelligence level approximates that of ogres—less than human but capable of speech, basic strategy, and social organization. They use giant acorns as ammunition, storing them in pouches and reloading with surprising dexterity using both hands and feet.

### Dietary Habits

Omnivorous with specific dietary restrictions. Notably, consuming lizardfolk makes grolsch sick, causing necrosis-like symptoms. This aversion is well-known among the creatures and influences their hunting behavior.

### Combat Tactics

Grolsch employ ranged attacks with slings using boulder-sized rocks and giant acorns as ammunition. In melee combat, they utilize their signature "power slam" ability—grappling opponents and smashing them into the ground with devastating force (Fortitude save based attack). Their natural climbing ability allows them to position themselves advantageously in trees and on elevated terrain.

## Strengths & Weaknesses

### Weaknesses

- **Fire vulnerability**: Inherited from yeti heritage, grolsch take increased damage from fire-based attacks
- **Will saves**: Their worst defensive capability, making them susceptible to mental and magical effects

### Abilities

- Natural climbing proficiency
- Two-action power slam grapple attack
- Ranged combat with slings
- Able to reload slings using feet while in trees
- Pack coordination and tactical positioning

## Ecology

Grolsch occupy highland and mountain regions, with a notable population controlling the [entity:8248838|Island Dwarven Ruins] in Waterfall Lake. They establish camps with fires for warmth and cooking, suggesting social structures and territory control. The creatures' woolly coats and cold adaptation indicate preference for elevated, cool environments.

## Notable History

- **The Island Occupation**: A substantial group of grolsch currently inhabits the [entity:8248838|Island Dwarven Ruins], establishing multiple camps across the structure
- **The Three-Way Battle**: On Orpheus 15th, grolsch engaged in combat with both the adventuring party and unidentified winged creatures, demonstrating territorial behavior and willingness to fight on multiple fronts

## Current Status

Active population controls the [entity:8248838|Island Dwarven Ruins], with approximately ten individuals encountered including elite, normal, and weak classifications. Their occupation of the ancient dwarven structure suggests either recent arrival or long-term settlement in the Waterfall Lake region.

## Secrets & Mysteries

The origin of grolsch as yeti-ogre hybrids raises questions about whether they arose naturally through interbreeding or through magical manipulation. Their specific establishment at the Island Dwarven Ruins may be coincidental or could indicate attraction to the site's characteristics or resources.
