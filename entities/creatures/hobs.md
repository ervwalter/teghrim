# Hobs

## Overview

Hobs are domesticated [entity:7763229|goblins] who have integrated into civilized society, forming mutually beneficial relationships with frontier settlements. Unlike their wild cousins who raid caravans and terrorize travelers, hobs work honest jobs and contribute to local communities through labor and specialized services.

## Description

### Physical Appearance

Hobs retain the small stature and green skin of their [entity:7763229|goblin] ancestry but are distinguished by their "football-shaped" heads and generally cleaner, better-maintained appearance. They typically stand 3-4 feet tall and dress in the simple work clothes of their adopted communities.

### Behavioral Traits

Where wild [entity:7763229|goblins] are vicious and sadistic, hobs have developed more cooperative tendencies through generations of domestication. They maintain some of their ancestral chaotic nature but channel it into industriousness and creative problem-solving rather than violence. Notably poor at climbing trees despite their goblin heritage.

## Culture & Society

### Settlement Integration

Hobs live on the outskirts of settlements like [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing], providing menial labor and specialized services in exchange for protection and food. They've developed particularly strong relationships with wagon repair services, forming what locals describe as "mutualistic relationships" with caravan operations.

### Social Structure

Hob communities maintain loose pack structures led by the smartest or most successful among them. They share resources communally and look after their own while respecting the laws and customs of their host settlements.

## Relations with Other Races

### With Civilized Races

Most civilized folk distinguish between evil wild [entity:7763229|goblins] and helpful hobs, though newcomers often need this difference explained. Hobs work various service jobs - servers in mess halls, wagon repair assistants, porters, and other support roles that benefit from their small size and nimble fingers.

### With Wild Goblins

Wild [entity:7763229|goblins] view hobs as traitors to their kind, while hobs see their feral cousins as embarrassments that make integration harder for domesticated goblinoids. This mutual animosity runs deep.

## Notable Hobs

## Historical Context

The domestication of goblins into hobs represents one of the few successful examples of monster race integration in the frontier regions. While they haven't achieved the military respect earned by integrated [entity:7763190|hobgoblins], hobs have carved out their own valuable niche in frontier society through service and trade skills.
