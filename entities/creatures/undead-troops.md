# Undead Troops

Undead troops are masses of fleshless corpses animated by the Fleshcrafter and deployed as coordinated military units. These horrifying collections of skinless bodies - the victims whose hides the necromancer wears as cloaks - shamble forward in two groups known as "walkers" and "crawlers," overwhelming enemies through numbers and coordinated assaults.

## Description

### Physical Appearance

Fleshless but otherwise intact corpses of various sizes, including human, bulky/large, and goblin-sized victims. All skin has been removed, exposing muscle and bone. The bodies show no individual will, moving as coordinated masses. These are the very people the Jailor captured - their skins now hang from the Fleshcrafter's arms as gruesome cloaks while their flayed bodies continue serving as her undead troops.

### Personality & Demeanor

Mindless undead operating under troop mechanics - multiple bodies sharing a single controlling will. Move and act as unified military formations rather than individual creatures.

### Abilities & Skills

**Troop Mechanics**: Follow special rules where multiple bodies share a single hit point pool. Number of enemies hit by area-of-effect attacks doesn't matter - the troop as a whole takes damage. Can be targeted multiple times by multi-target spells like Electric Arc.

**Shambling Onslaught**: Primary attack where the mass of undead overwhelms targets in their space. Requires reflex saves, with two-action version dealing increased damage. Can target single victim or entire area.

**Difficult Terrain**: Create difficult terrain around themselves as the shambling mass of bodies impedes movement.

**Special Weaknesses**: Particularly vulnerable to area-of-effect spells, splash damage, and slashing damage which cuts through the mass of bodies. Spirit and sanctified damage less effective against these purely physical undead.

**Formations**: Deploy in two types - "walkers" (upright shambling corpses) and "crawlers" (bodies moving on all fours or dragging themselves forward).

## Background

The flayed victims of the Fleshcrafter's experiments, animated to serve as military troops defending her lair. Their skins have been removed to create the necromancer's grotesque cloaks, while their skinless bodies continue fighting as undead servants.

## Relationships

- **The Fleshcrafter**: Creator who flayed them alive and animated their remains
- **The Jailor**: The construct that originally captured these victims for the Fleshcrafter
- **Skull Rock Dungeon**: Deployed in the Fleshcrafter's personal chamber as final line of defense

## Notable History

- **The Flaying**: Victims captured by the Jailor were flayed alive, their skins becoming the Fleshcrafter's cloak
- **The Animation**: Fleshless corpses raised as coordinated troop units - walkers and crawlers
- **The Final Defense**: Deployed alongside the Fleshcrafter herself in her personal chamber
- **The Troop Discovery**: Party learned mid-combat that these enemies followed special "troop" rules with shared hit points
- **The Tactical Challenge**: Required area-of-effect spells and slashing damage to efficiently destroy the masses
- **The Brutal End**: All troops destroyed through concentrated martial assault and magical attacks after the Fleshcrafter's retreat

## Current Status

The walker and crawler troops stationed in the Fleshcrafter's chamber have been destroyed. Their remains now lie scattered throughout her personal quarters. However, the Fleshcrafter's escape and knowledge of troop creation suggests she could raise more undead forces if provided with new victims.

## Treatment

Undead troops are best countered with area-of-effect magic, splash damage, and slashing weapons that can cut through multiple bodies. Avoid single-target attacks unless no other options exist. Sanctified spirit damage and holy magic prove less effective against these purely corporeal undead.
