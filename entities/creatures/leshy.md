# Leshy

Leshies are small plant-based creatures that serve as nature's guardians and companions to druids and other wilderness protectors. These living plants possess intelligence and mobility, making them valuable allies in forest environments.

## Description

### Physical Appearance
Small humanoid figures composed entirely of plant matter, typically standing no more than three feet tall. Their bodies are made of intertwined vines, leaves, and bark, with features that vary based on their plant origin - some resemble walking shrubs, others appear as animated flowers or fungi.

### Nature
Intelligent plant creatures with strong connections to the natural world. Capable of communication and forming bonds with those who protect nature, particularly druids and rangers.

### Abilities
- Natural camouflage in forest environments
- Communication with plants and nature spirits
- Resistance to many natural toxins
- Vulnerability to fire and fungal infections

## Role in Nature
Leshies often serve as:
- Familiars to druids and nature-focused spellcasters
- Guardians of sacred groves and forest sites
- Messengers between civilized areas and wild spaces

## Notable Individuals

### Aelysh's Familiar
A leshy companion to the wood elf druid [entity:7764102|Aelysh] who resided near [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing]. This particular leshy became infected with a dangerous fungus after venturing into a cave containing a myconid. While under the fungal creature's mind control, it acted aggressively until the myconid was destroyed, after which it fled. Its condition prompted [entity:7764102|Aelysh] to seek help, leading to the successful fungus investigation quest.

## Vulnerabilities
Despite their plant-based resilience, leshies are susceptible to:
- Fungal infections that can override their natural instincts
- Fire damage due to their combustible nature
- Mind control effects from creatures like myconids
