# Old Gus

Old Gus was a large brown bear with unusual black coloration that plagued [entity:7921763|Old Willy's] elderberry farm. After being killed by adventurers, the bear returned as an undead variant, revealing a connection to the dark forces corrupting the region around the cursed stone formation.

## Description

### Physical Appearance

In life, Old Gus appeared as a large brown bear with distinctive black coloration that seemed unnatural for the species. After death and reanimation, the creature maintained its bear form but with clear signs of undeath - likely including decay, unnatural movement, and resistance to normal damage.

### Personality & Demeanor

As a living bear, showed unusual persistence and intelligence in raiding [entity:7921763|Old Willy's] elderberry bushes, suggesting the berries had an addictive or transformative effect. The undead version demonstrated relentless aggression and immunity to pain, attacking with supernatural ferocity.

### Abilities & Skills

**Living Form**: Strong fortitude but weak reflex saves, powerful bite and claw attacks, grappling ability that could restrain victims, surprising speed despite size.

**Undead Form**: Resistance or immunity to normal weapon damage, enhanced strength and aggression, no vital organs to target, required complete destruction rather than simple death to stop permanently.

## Background

A wild bear that developed an unusual fixation on [entity:7921763|Old Willy's] elderberries, possibly due to their magical properties. The regular consumption of these alchemically significant berries may have made Old Gus susceptible to the necromantic energies pervading the region.

## Relationships

- **[entity:7921763|Old Willy]**: Primary victim of the bear's elderberry raids, considered Old Gus a persistent menace
- **The Cursed Stone Formation**: Proximity to this source of necrotic energy likely caused the bear's undead resurrection
- **Regional Wildlife**: Part of the dangerous fauna making the wilderness beyond [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing] hazardous

## Notable History

- **The Elderberry Raids**: Regularly stole berries from [entity:7921763|Old Willy's] farm, developing what seemed like an addiction
- **The First Death**: Killed by adventuring party (Qotal, Aurelia, Bruldin, Arnor) in combat defending the farm
- **The Undead Rising**: Returned as an undead creature shortly after death, demonstrating the corrupting influence of nearby dark magic
- **The Final Destruction**: Completely destroyed by the party after a more difficult battle against its undead form

## Current Status

Permanently destroyed after being eliminated in both living and undead forms. The creature's transformation serves as evidence of the spreading corruption from the cursed stone formation affecting local wildlife.

## Secrets & Mysteries

The exact mechanism that caused Old Gus to rise as undead remains unclear - whether it was proximity to the cursed stones, consumption of magical elderberries, or a combination of factors. The bear's unusual coloration and behavior even before death suggests some prior supernatural influence.
