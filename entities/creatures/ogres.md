# Ogres

Ogres are large, intelligent humanoids known for their violent temperament, cannibalistic tendencies, and extreme difficulty to negotiate with. In the Highland Uplands region, these creatures have established territorial control, using tribal drums to communicate and mark their domain while hunting any who enter their lands.

## Description

### Physical Appearance

Massive humanoids standing significantly taller than humans, with brutish features and powerful builds. Encountered specimens carry various weapons including swords, axes, javelins, greataxes, and staves. Female ogres (Ogre Ladies) appear to hold leadership roles, distinguishable by their choice of weapons and combat style.

### Behavior & Tactics

Ogres demonstrate intelligence but channel it toward violence and predation. They like to eat people, including members of their own kind when food grows scarce. This makes them extremely hard to negotiate with—their first instinct tends toward violence rather than diplomacy.

Use tribal drums for communication, particularly at dusk when they signal their presence across the highlands. The drumming differs notably from orc tribal drums, suggesting distinct cultural traditions. When hunting or patrolling territory, ogres crash through woods making considerable noise, showing little concern for stealth.

In combat, employ coordinated tactics with mixed weapon types—javelin throwers provide ranged support while melee fighters close with swords, axes, or greataxes. Leadership variants like Ogre Ladies demonstrate enhanced combat capabilities and appear to direct group tactics.

### Abilities & Characteristics

**Combat Prowess**: Formidable fighters capable of dealing significant damage. Encountered ogres demonstrated attack bonuses high enough to threaten experienced adventurers, with individual hits dealing 9-16 slashing damage.

**Javelin Attacks**: Many ogres carry javelins for ranged combat, engaging enemies before closing to melee.

**Leadership Variants**: Ogre Ladies serve as enhanced leaders with superior combat stats, wielding two-handed weapons like greataxes and staves.

**Jotun Language**: Speak the giant tongue, suggesting cultural and possibly ancestral connections to giant-kin.

**Tribal Drums**: Use distinctive drumming patterns for long-distance communication, different from orc drums.

## Background

As giant-kin who speak Jotun, ogres represent one of the more dangerous intelligent species inhabiting wilderness regions. Their cannibalistic nature and violent disposition have prevented them from integrating into civilized societies, relegating them to remote areas where they can hunt and terrorize without organized opposition.

## Relationships

- **Highland Uplands**: Current territorial control of this wilderness region
- **Ettins**: Two-headed relatives, distinct but related giant-kin
- **Giant-kin**: Broader family of Jotun-speaking creatures
- **Prey Species**: Hunt anything that enters their territory, including travelers

## Notable History

- **The Highland Territory**: Established presence in Highland Uplands following the [entity:7766459|hob] migration downward approximately 50 years ago

- **The Drum Signals**: Tribal drumming heard at dusk on Orpheus 4th, marking territory and warning intruders

- **The Three Ogres** (Orpheus 5th): Party encountered three ogres in Highland Uplands—Sword Ogre (sword and javelin), Ax Ogre (axe and javelin), and Ogre Lady (leader with staff and greataxe). All three defeated in combat, with [entity:7763294|Aurelia] delivering all three killing blows, earning title "Ogre Killer" and "Aurelia, the Vampire Ogre Killer."

## Current Status

Territorial control of Highland Uplands continues despite the defeat of one hunting party. Drumming and movement sounds suggest additional ogre populations remain active in the region. Their presence makes highland travel extremely dangerous for unprepared groups.

## Secrets & Mysteries

The relationship between ogres and other giant-kin, particularly their separation from more organized giant societies, remains unclear. Their territorial claims and population density in the Highland Uplands are unknown.
