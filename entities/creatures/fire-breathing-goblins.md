# Fire-Breathing Goblins

Fire-Breathing Goblins are small goblinoid creatures equipped with burning alchemical potions that allow them to exhale devastating cones of flame. These specialized combatants combine goblin cunning with alchemical weaponry, creating dangerous area-effect threats despite their diminutive size.

## Description

### Physical Appearance

Small-statured goblins displaying classic Tolkien-style features including slimy, drooly mouths and generally uncouth appearance. Their hands carry burning flasks or potions that fuel their fire-breathing capabilities, often creating visible flames or smoke as they prepare attacks.

### Combat Behavior

Fire-breathing goblins position themselves to maximize the number of targets caught in their cone-shaped breath attacks, showing tactical awareness despite their small size. They typically operate in support roles, softening multiple enemies with area damage while larger allies engage in melee.

### Tactical Capabilities

**Special Attacks:**
- **Fire Breath**: 15-foot cone of flame requiring Reflex DC 18 save
- **Damage Profile**: Approximately 7 damage on failed save, 3 damage on successful save, 14 damage on critical failure
- **Tactical Positioning**: Can angle breath weapons to hit multiple targets while avoiding allies
- **Alchemical Dependency**: Breath weapon powered by consumable burning potions

**Combat Limitations:**
- Small size limits melee effectiveness
- Dependent on alchemical supplies for signature ability
- Limited skill options for "pizazz" combat displays

## Background

Fire-breathing goblins represent either alchemical experimentation, cultural tradition, or tactical innovation within goblin and orc alliance forces. Their integration into orc tribal structures suggests valued role despite species differences.

## Relationships

- **Orc Tribes**: Serve as allied forces in tribal gatherings and combat operations
- **Goblin Groups**: Part of larger goblin contingents allied with orc warriors
- **Alchemical Suppliers**: Dependent on source of burning potions for combat effectiveness

## Notable History

- **The Moot Challenge**: Three fire-breathing goblins participated in gladiatorial combat against the party on Aestra-Orpheus 31st
- **The Opening Barrage**: Delivered significant area damage across multiple party members in early combat rounds, with [entity:7763295|Bruldin Grimstone] suffering critical failure and taking 14 damage from breath weapon
- **The Tactical Display**: Demonstrated ability to angle breath attacks to avoid hitting allied orc rampagers while maximizing party member targets
- **The Insult Tactics**: Attempted to contribute to "pizazz" scoring by hurling verbal insults at opponents, their version of flashy combat
- **The Defeat**: Eliminated through combination of area spells and focused attacks after party adapted to breath weapon threat

## Current Status

Fire-breathing goblins continue to serve in orc tribal forces as specialized area-damage combatants, maintaining their role in both military operations and gladiatorial displays.

## Secrets & Mysteries

The origin of the burning potions that fuel their fire breath, whether this ability is widespread among goblin populations or limited to specific groups, the alchemy required to produce the consumables, and whether fire-breathing goblins have additional capabilities beyond those observed in gladiatorial combat remain unexplored questions.
