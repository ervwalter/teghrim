# Skeleton Warriors

Skeleton warriors are animated undead minions wielding reach weapons, raised from bone piles by powerful necromancers. These efficient combatants demonstrate tactical coordination despite their mindless nature, serving as expendable troops for their creators.

## Description

### Physical Appearance

Animated skeletons armed with glaives (reach weapons), their bones bleached white and held together by necromantic energy. They move with eerie coordination, striking with reach weapons that extend their threat range.

### Personality & Demeanor

Mindless undead servants that follow necromantic commands without question. Demonstrate basic tactical awareness such as taking defensive stances and using reach advantage from elevated positions.

### Abilities & Skills

**Combat Capabilities**: Wield glaives with reach, allowing attacks from 10 feet away. Can take defensive stances to improve defenses. Utilize elevation advantages when available.

**Resistances**: Resistant to electricity and piercing damage. Take reduced damage from these attack types.

**Vulnerabilities**: Weak to bludgeoning and spirit damage, which destroy them efficiently. No special defenses against these damage types.

## Background

Common undead minions raised by necromancers from accumulated bones. The Fleshcrafter demonstrated the ability to animate five skeleton warriors from a bone pile with simple verbal commands.

## Relationships

- **The Fleshcrafter**: Necromancer who raised them to capture intruders
- **Bone Piles**: Animated from accumulated skeletal remains in Skull Rock dungeon

## Notable History

- **The Bone Chamber Ambush**: Five skeleton warriors raised by the Fleshcrafter in response to party's sarcastic greeting
- **The Glaive Formation**: Deployed with reach weapons from multiple elevations to maximize tactical advantage
- **The Swift Defeat**: All five skeletons destroyed in approximately three rounds of combat through concentrated bludgeoning and spirit damage

## Current Status

The five skeleton warriors raised in Skull Rock have been destroyed. However, with bone piles throughout the dungeon complex, more could be animated if necromantic power returns to the location.

## Treatment

Skeleton warriors are most efficiently dispatched with bludgeoning weapons (hammers, staves, mauls) or sanctified spirit damage. Avoid using piercing weapons or electricity-based attacks, which prove less effective against their animated bones.
