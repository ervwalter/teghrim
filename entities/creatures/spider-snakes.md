# Spider Snakes

Spider Snakes are venomous ambush predators that combine serpentine bodies with spider-like abilities, inhabiting ceiling holes and using silk webbing to execute hit-and-run tactics against prey. They come in multiple size varieties and pose significant threats through both their attacks and dangerous venom.

## Description

### Physical Appearance

Serpentine creatures that vary in size from small to large variants. Possess the ability to produce silk strands similar to spiders, which they use for mobility and ambush tactics. Multiple specimens display different colorations, though these may be incidental to their biology rather than true subspecies.

### Behavior & Tactics

Highly tactical ambush hunters that make their lairs in ceiling holes connected by webbing. Use silk threads to descend upon prey, attack with venomous bites, then retreat back into ceiling holes when able. The hit-and-run approach allows them to wear down victims over time while minimizing their own risk.

Smaller varieties demonstrate superior aerial mobility, consistently pulling themselves back into ceiling holes after attacking. Larger specimens sometimes lose their silk strand integrity when descending, forcing them to remain in melee combat. When their retreat path is compromised, they fight more aggressively, staying engaged with targets.

Create funnel webs in their lairs filled with desiccated prey - dead bugs, small rats, and other victims stuck to the webbing. These nests serve as both hunting grounds and food storage.

### Abilities & Characteristics

**Combat Capabilities**: Venomous bite attacks requiring Fortitude saves to resist poison effects. The venom causes ongoing damage over time and can quickly overwhelm victims who fail their saves. Multiple attacks per round allow them to deliver venom to several targets or focus fire on single opponents.

**Tactical Movement**: Silk thread production enables vertical mobility, allowing them to attack from above and retreat to safety. Can navigate ceiling holes and tunnels with ease. Larger variants may have structural issues with their webbing under their own weight.

**Environmental Mastery**: Prefer dark environments where they can ambush from above. No light source needed for their hunting. Create extensive web networks in caves and tunnels.

## Notable Encounters

- **Skull Rock Ambush**: Party encountered multiple spider snakes (designated purple, green, and red by their combat miniatures) in the carved tunnels. The creatures used ceiling holes to execute ambush tactics, with smaller variants successfully employing hit-and-run strategies while a larger specimen became trapped in melee combat after its silk strand failed.

## Current Status

Spider snakes inhabit Skull Rock dungeon and potentially other cave systems in the region. Their presence in the necromancer's lair may be opportunistic rather than controlled, as they appeared to be natural inhabitants taking advantage of the tunnel structure.

## Weaknesses

Fire proves effective against their webbing. Area-of-effect electricity spells can damage multiple specimens, though they show some resistance to electric damage. When prevented from retreating to ceiling holes, they lose their primary tactical advantage and must fight as standard melee opponents.
