# Giant Rats (Diseased)

Giant Rats, also known as Rodents of Unusual Size, are oversized rodents that inhabit both dungeon environments and operate in organized swarms under intelligent direction. Near [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing], these creatures have been organized into coordinated raids by [entity:7763213|Skaven] rat people, conducting military-style assaults on settlements for food and supplies while spreading disease through their bites.

## Description

### Physical Appearance

Standard rats enlarged to threatening size, but still clearly living creatures rather than undead constructs. Multiple specimens display different colorations. Described as "rat rats" by witnesses to emphasize their mundane nature despite their size and disease.

### Behavior & Tactics

In dungeon environments, emerge from bone piles and refuse heaps in waves, using numerical superiority to overwhelm opponents. In the wild or under [entity:7763213|Skaven] control, display highly unusual organized behavior including coordinated attacks, tactical theft operations, and systematic retreats.

Under [entity:7763213|Skaven] direction, giant rats follow specific objectives beyond simple feedingâ€”carrying food sacks, dragging cheese chunks, and systematically looting supplies while smaller observer rats maintain command positions from elevated locations. When observer rats signal retreat, the giant rats use all available actions to escape with stolen goods, demonstrating military-level coordination unnatural for typical wildlife.

### Abilities & Characteristics

**Disease Transmission**: Primary threat comes from disease carried in their bite. Victims who fail Fortitude saves contract a condition causing Clumsy 1 indefinitely until magically cured. The disease cannot be shaken off naturally and requires intervention from healers capable of curing diseases.

**Wave Tactics**: Emerge in coordinated groups (designated as green wave, blue wave, etc. for tactical tracking), creating successive threats rather than single overwhelming assault.

**Environmental Adaptation**: Thrive in dungeon environments, particularly those with bone piles or organic refuse. Can hide within their terrain and emerge when threats approach.

## Notable Encounters

- **Skull Rock Bone Chamber**: Multiple waves of giant rats attacked party members from bone pile in the large chamber. Several party members took damage, with at least one contracting the debilitating disease that causes permanent Clumsy 1 condition until cured.

- **The Bridge Raid** (Orpheus 2nd): Massive coordinated assault on [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing] with giant rats surging through doors, windows, and floorboards of the mess hall. Observer rats maintained command positions while giant rats conducted organized theft operations. Individual rats dealt approximately 5 piercing plus 3 poison damage per bite. Most rats successfully escaped with stolen food and supplies when observer rats signaled coordinated retreat.

- **The Shrine Attack** (Orpheus 2nd): Simultaneous assault on [entity:7763866|Lyn Chong's] shrine construction site, indicating multi-target campaign orchestrated by [entity:7763213|Skaven] clans.

## Current Status

Giant rat populations inhabit Skull Rock dungeon and operate in organized swarms around [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing] under [entity:7763213|Skaven] control. Two [entity:7763213|Skaven] clans (one male-led, one female-led) appear to be directing coordinated raids using giant rats as shock troops. The professional nature of their operations with observer rat commanders indicates an ongoing organized threat rather than random wildlife encounters.

Their hundreds of skeletal remains throughout Skull Rock tunnels suggest either a very large population or high mortality rate from other dungeon inhabitants.

## Treatment

Disease caused by giant rat bites requires magical healing from practitioners capable of curing diseases. Aelysh has been identified as a local healer with disease-curing abilities. Lyn Chong specializes in curse removal rather than disease treatment.
