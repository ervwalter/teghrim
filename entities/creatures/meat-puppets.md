# Meat Puppets

Meat puppets are grotesque medium-sized undead constructs created by the Fleshcrafter, made from stitched smooth leather with writhing movements and the ability to vomit maggot-infested poison at their enemies. These agile horrors use hit-and-run tactics, bouncing considerable distances to ambush and poison their victims.

## Description

### Physical Appearance

Medium-sized constructs made of smooth stitched leather that writhe and wriggle unnaturally. Their bodies feature shiny black eyes set in otherwise featureless faces. Small meat cleavers or daggers serve as their primary weapons. Despite their horrifying appearance, they move with surprising agility and can leap impressive heights.

### Personality & Demeanor

Mindless undead constructs that follow ambush tactics programmed by their creator. Demonstrate coordinated pack hunting behavior, using elevated positions and flanking maneuvers to maximum effect.

### Abilities & Skills

**Combat Capabilities**: Wield small cleavers and daggers in melee combat. Can jump and bounce considerable distances (up to 10 feet high) to land on enemies from above, attacking during the descent. Use hit-and-run tactics, jumping away after attacks. Capable of flanking to gain combat advantages.

**Vomit Attack**: Can spit maggot-infested poison slime as a ranged attack requiring reflex saves. Maggots attempt to crawl into wounds, causing poison damage. Extra damage inflicted on targets already wounded, as the maggots burrow deeper into existing injuries.

**Explosive Death**: When destroyed, meat puppets explode in a spray of maggots and gore, requiring reflex saves from adjacent creatures to avoid additional poison damage.

**Resistances**: Possess some resistance to standard damage.

**Vulnerabilities**: Particularly vulnerable to electricity damage, taking extra effective damage from lightning-based attacks.

## Background

Created by the Fleshcrafter as ambush guardians for her ritual chamber. Nine meat puppets lay in wait among the shelves and workbenches, attacking when intruders entered the chamber with the soul orb portal.

## Relationships

- **The Fleshcrafter**: Creator who deployed them as ambush troops
- **Skull Rock Ritual Chamber**: Stationed throughout the chamber to defend the necromancer's workspace

## Notable History

- **The Ritual Chamber Ambush**: Nine meat puppets ambushed the party from shelves and workbenches throughout the ritual chamber
- **The Vomit Barrage**: Repeatedly attacked party members with maggot-infested poison vomit from range
- **The Bouncing Assaults**: Used vertical jumping attacks to strike casters in the back line before bouncing away
- **The Explosive Finale**: When destroyed, their explosive deaths spread additional maggot poison to adjacent combatants
- **The Extended Battle**: Combat lasted approximately 8-10 rounds as the creatures used hit-and-run tactics
- **Total Annihilation**: All nine meat puppets eventually destroyed, though they inflicted heavy attrition on the party

## Current Status

The nine meat puppets stationed in the Fleshcrafter's ritual chamber have been destroyed. However, the Fleshcrafter's escape suggests she retains the knowledge to create more of these constructs if she establishes a new base of operations.

## Treatment

Maggot poison from meat puppet attacks causes ongoing poison damage that worsens in wounded victims as the larvae attempt to burrow into flesh. Reflex saves can reduce the effect. The explosive death spray also inflicts poison damage requiring reflex saves to mitigate. Electricity-based attacks prove particularly effective against these constructs.
