# Observer Rats

Observer Rats are normal-sized rats displaying highly unusual organized watching behavior under [entity:7763213|Skaven] control. During coordinated raids, these creatures serve as commanders and coordinators rather than combatants, maintaining elevated positions to direct swarms of [entity:8244509|giant rats] through squeaked signals and observation.

## Description

### Physical Appearance

Normal-sized rats, physically indistinguishable from common rodents. Their significance lies entirely in their behavior rather than any unusual physical characteristics.

### Behavior & Tactics

Display profoundly unnatural organized behavior that marks them as under intelligent control. During raids, observer rats station themselves at elevated command positions—perched on windowsills, rocks, and other vantage points—where they watch the battle unfold without directly participating in combat.

These rats serve as the command and control element of [entity:7763213|Skaven]-directed operations. They observe tactical developments, maintain awareness of threats and opportunities, and use squeaking sounds to signal coordinated retreats or maneuvers to the [entity:8244509|giant rat] swarms under their direction.

When operations conclude or when threatened, observer rats hop down from their positions and systematically disappear, maintaining their surveillance network's security.

### Abilities & Characteristics

**Command Coordination**: Primary ability lies in directing [entity:8244509|giant rat] swarms through visual observation and auditory signals. Their elevated positions provide clear sight lines for tactical assessment.

**Signal System**: Use distinctive squeaking patterns to communicate orders across the battlefield, particularly for coordinated retreats and tactical withdrawals.

**Strategic Withdrawal**: When their swarm forces retreat or when personally threatened, observer rats abandon their positions and disappear efficiently, preserving intelligence assets.

**Unnatural Organization**: The very existence of this behavior pattern indicates something fundamentally unnatural controlling these creatures—typical rats do not organize into command hierarchies or conduct systematic military operations.

## Background

Observer rats represent one of the most unsettling aspects of [entity:7763213|Skaven] operations—the ability to transform common vermin into a distributed intelligence network and tactical command structure. Their presence transforms what might appear to be a simple rat infestation into evidence of organized military activity.

## Relationships

- **[entity:7763213|Skaven]**: Controllers who direct their observation and command activities
- **[entity:8244509|Giant Rats]**: Forces under their tactical direction
- **[entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing]**: Primary target of their commanded operations

## Notable History

- **The Bridge Raid** (Orpheus 2nd): Observer rats maintained command positions on windowsills and elevated rocks during massive coordinated assault on [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing] mess hall. Nature check (27) determined their behavior was highly unusual and something unnatural was controlling them.
- **The Coordinated Retreat**: After [entity:8244509|giant rats] had stolen sufficient supplies and faced mounting casualties, observer rats squeaked signals causing all remaining giant rats to use every action to climb through windows and flee. Observer rats then hopped down and disappeared.
- **The Shrine Attack** (Orpheus 2nd): Separate observer rat presence confirmed at [entity:7763866|Lyn Chong's] shrine construction site, indicating multi-site coordination by [entity:7763213|Skaven] commanders.

## Current Status

Active component of [entity:7763213|Skaven] operations around [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing]. Their presence indicates ongoing surveillance and potential for future coordinated raids. Two [entity:7763213|Skaven] clans (one male-led, one female-led) likely maintain separate observer rat networks as part of their intelligence and command infrastructure.

## Secrets & Mysteries

The mechanism by which [entity:7763213|Skaven] exert control over observer rats remains unclear—whether through training, magical compulsion, or some form of telepathic link is unknown. The sophistication of their tactical coordination suggests either very advanced training or supernatural control methods.
