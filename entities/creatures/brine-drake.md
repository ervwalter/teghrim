# Brine Drake

The Brine Drake is a fearsome aquatic dragon-like creature capable of walking upon water surfaces as if solid ground. Possessing frightful presence and devastating breath weapons, this water-dwelling predator represents a significant threat to those traveling near rivers and lakes in the [entity:8248775|Highland Uplands].

## Description

### Physical Appearance

A large dragon-like creature adapted for aquatic environments, with features suited for both water and surface combat. Its body is built for swimming while maintaining the ability to walk atop water through supernatural means. When engaged in combat, a misty aura manifests around the creature, particularly when it successfully strikes opponents.

### Combat Abilities

The Brine Drake possesses multiple fearsome abilities. Its frightful presence extends in a 60-foot aura, requiring will saves from all within range. Those who fail become frightened (level 2), while success still inflicts a lesser frightened condition (level 1). Notably, creatures become immune to this effect for the remainder of combat after their first save, whether successful or not.

Its breath weapon manifests as a straight-line spray requiring reflex saves. On a failed save, targets suffer 33 damage, while successful saves reduce this to 16 damage. The creature demonstrates tactical awareness by entering frenzy mode during extended combat, unleashing multiple attacks in rapid succession. Some of its attacks possess reach while others do not, requiring opponents to carefully manage their positioning.

The creature walks upon water surfaces as easily as solid ground, giving it significant tactical advantages when fighting near bodies of water. Despite appearances and assumptions made by those encountering it, the Brine Drake is not particularly vulnerable to fire-based attacks.

### Behavior

Territorial and aggressive when its domain is encroached upon, the Brine Drake ambushes travelers near water sources. It demonstrates both animal cunning and draconic ferocity in combat, utilizing its various abilities to maximum effect.

## Background

Brine Drakes inhabit waterways and lakes in wilderness regions, establishing territories they defend viciously against intruders. Little is known about their origins, breeding habits, or whether they represent a natural species or magical creation. Game masters utilize Brine Dragon stat blocks when running these creatures, as standard Pathfinder rules do not include Brine Drakes as a distinct creature type.

## Relationships

- **[entity:8248775|Highland Uplands]**: Primary known habitat
- **River Systems**: Territorial domains where they hunt
- **Waterfall Lake**: Potential habitat given aquatic nature

## Notable History

- **The River Ambush** (Orpheus 10th): A Brine Drake ambushed [entity:7763296|Qotal], [entity:7763289|Alrik], [entity:7763295|Bruldin], and [entity:7764100|Gierr] as they returned from their highland expedition near a river confluence. The party's perception checks allowed them to avoid complete surprise. During the battle, [entity:7763289|Alrik's] recall knowledge attempt critically failed, leading him to incorrectly identify the creature as weak to fire. [entity:7763295|Bruldin] burned through multiple resolve points using Steel Your Resolve to maintain stamina. [entity:7763296|Qotal] delivered the killing blow with 57 damage from double natural 20 rolls. The party acknowledged they were nearly defeated and would have retreated if combat had continued longer.

- **The Failed Identification**: Following the battle, all party recall knowledge attempts failed to properly identify the creature. [entity:7763296|Qotal] sketched it in his sketchbook for later reference. The creature's true nature remained unknown until the party could consult with experts.

## Current Status

At least one Brine Drake inhabited the river systems of the [entity:8248775|Highland Uplands] until its defeat on Orpheus 10th. Whether others exist in the region's waterways remains unknown. The creature's presence suggests these predators may be more widespread in highland water sources than currently realized.

## Secrets & Mysteries

The origin and full extent of Brine Drake population in the region is unknown. Whether they are natural creatures, magical creations, or transformed beings like dragon ogres has not been established. Their relationship to true dragons and whether they represent a lesser draconic species or entirely different magical origin remains unclear.
