# Rust Ooze

Rust oozes are amorphous creatures that emerge from deteriorating structures to attack travelers with their corrosive properties. These oozes are particularly dangerous to warriors relying on metal weapons and armor due to their ability to rapidly degrade steel and iron.

## Description

### Physical Appearance
Formless masses of rust-colored slime that can squeeze through small spaces such as gaps between bridge planks. Their gelatinous bodies constantly drip with corrosive secretions that oxidize metal on contact.

### Behavior
Ambush predators that lurk in old structures, emerging when prey crosses above or near their hiding spots. They attack without warning, rising up through cracks and gaps to engulf victims.

### Combat Capabilities
- Highly resistant to physical attacks from metal weapons
- Cause rapid degradation of steel and iron equipment
- Vulnerable to lightning and electrical attacks
- Can squeeze through extremely narrow spaces

## Notable Encounters

### The Bridge Ambush
Two rust oozes attacked [entity:7763294|Aurelia], [entity:7763290|Arnór Josefson], and [entity:7763295|Bruldin Grimstone] while crossing an old rickety bridge near [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing]. The creatures emerged from between the bridge planks halfway across, forcing the party to rely on [entity:7763290|Arnór's] lightning magic after discovering their steel weapons were both ineffective and being damaged by contact with the oozes.

## Habitat
Found in old, deteriorating structures where metal has begun to rust and decay. Bridges, abandoned buildings, and ancient ruins provide ideal hunting grounds for these creatures.

## Threat Assessment
Particularly dangerous to heavily armored warriors and those relying on metal weapons. Parties encountering rust oozes should employ magic, especially electrical attacks, rather than conventional weaponry.
