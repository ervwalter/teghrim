# Skaven Investigation

The party has agreed to investigate a [entity:7763213|Skaven] threat near [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing] following coordinated raids on both the bridge settlement and [entity:7763866|Lyn Chong's] shrine construction site. Two clans of rat people—one male-led, one female-led—appear to be operating in the region, using controlled swarms of [entity:8244509|giant rats] and [observer rats] to conduct organized theft operations.

## Objectives

- Locate the two [entity:7763213|Skaven] clan bases (one male-led, one female-led) operating near [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing]
- Determine [entity:7763213|Skaven] intentions—permanent settlement, raiding for survival, or larger goals
- Assess threat level to [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing] and surrounding settlements
- Investigate connection between [entity:7763213|Skaven] and the coordinated [entity:8244509|giant rat] swarms
- Determine if peaceful coexistence is possible or if the threat must be eliminated

## Background

On Orpheus 2nd, [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing] suffered a massive coordinated [entity:8244509|giant rat] attack during morning meal service at the mess hall. The rats displayed highly unusual organized behavior—attacking through doors, windows, and floorboards while smaller observer rats maintained command positions and directed tactical operations. The swarm conducted systematic theft of food and supplies before executing a coordinated retreat when observer rats signaled withdrawal.

[entity:7763866|Lyn Chong] approached the party on Orpheus 3rd with concerning news that the attack pattern matched [entity:7763213|Skaven] operations from the [entity:7763168|Jade Kingdoms], where rat people have formed symbiotic communities on settlement outskirts. His shrine construction site suffered a simultaneous attack, indicating multi-target coordination by organized [entity:7763213|Skaven] leadership.

[entity:7763295|Bruldin Grimstone] declared "This threat must be taken care of," and the party agreed to investigate when they return from their Highland Uplands expedition.

## Key Information

**Skaven Biology & Culture** (from [entity:7763866|Lyn Chong]):
- Rat people from [entity:7763168|Jade Kingdoms] who form symbiotic communities near civilizations
- Opportunistic scavengers who infiltrate sewers and conduct nighttime raids
- Carry disease and pestilence
- Form unusual religious cults
- Always operate in paired clans: one male-led, one female-led
- Successfully integrated into [entity:7763168|Jade Kingdoms] society through waste management and sewer maintenance

**Raid Characteristics**:
- Professional military-style coordination
- Use of observer rats as tactical commanders
- Systematic theft operations targeting food and supplies
- Multi-site simultaneous attacks (bridge and shrine)
- Something unnatural controlling the [entity:8244509|giant rats] (Nature check 27 determination)

## Participants

- [entity:7763296|Qotal]: Witnessed mess hall attack, assisted in cleanup
- [entity:7763289|Alrik Grimmelstang]: Present during attack, identified unnatural control
- [entity:7763294|Aurelia]: Fought in mess hall defense
- [entity:7763290|Arnor Josefson]: Participated in combat, used spells against rats
- [entity:7763295|Bruldin Grimstone]: Committed to eliminating threat

## Current Status

Quest added to party's mystery board on Orpheus 3rd. Investigation postponed while party explores Highland Uplands and pursues other urgent matters. The [entity:7763213|Skaven] clans remain active in the region, with their bases unlocated and their long-term intentions unknown.

## Possible Complications

- [entity:7763213|Skaven] may seek peaceful integration similar to [entity:7763168|Jade Kingdoms] model
- Attacking the clans could eliminate potential allies who handle waste management
- Disease and pestilence risk from [entity:7763213|Skaven] populations
- Religious cult aspects may complicate negotiations
- Two separate clans require separate diplomatic or military approaches
- Existing sewer infiltration suggests they may have extensive underground network

## Related Mysteries

- What is biting [entity:7764195|Gaz] and other goblins? (Possibly related to [entity:7763213|Skaven] presence)
- Are the [entity:7763213|Skaven] connected to other regional threats or operating independently?
