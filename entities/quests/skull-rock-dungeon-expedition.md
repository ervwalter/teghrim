# Skull Rock Dungeon Expedition

The party's investigation of the Jailor threat led them into Skull Rock dungeon beneath the cursed stone formation, where they discovered a powerful necromancer operating a flesh-crafting laboratory and commanding undead forces. What began as a mission to eliminate a dangerous construct revealed a far deeper and more sinister operation.

## Objectives

- Investigate the source of the Jailor threat
- Eliminate the Jailor construct
- Rescue any potential victims held in the dungeon
- Understand the necromancer's operations and goals
- Clear the dungeon of undead threats

## Quest Givers & Support

- **Community Need**: General threat to Teghrim's Crossing area from Jailor attacks
- **Osanna Von Carstein**: Provided crucial assistance by disabling the necrotic curse field protecting the entrance (knocked unconscious by positive energy pulse in the process)
- **Lyn Chong & Rosencrantz**: Created three specialized anti-Jailor potion bombs using ichor from previous Jailor encounter

## Participants

- Qotal (primary participants)
- Arnor (primary participants)
- Alrik (primary participants)
- Bruldin (primary participants)
- Aurelia (absent from initial entry, Katie's player absent)

## Quest Progress

### Preparation Phase (Aestra-Orpheus 28th)

The party spent downtime gathering intelligence and befriending NPCs who could provide assistance:

- Qotal befriended Gaz (second day, +2 bonus for future checks)
- Alrik befriended Sylvia Mournhold, learning she buys gems and goods at better prices
- Arnor befriended Gierr Bjornson through archery practice (natural 20, critical success), gaining "Norn Brew" benefit (free elixir before each mission)
- Bruldin managed witch activities and time with Sigrid

During breakfast discussions, the party learned:
- Arnor discovered Aelysh's familiar found an Eris medallion in the woods, suggesting Priests of Discord presence
- Qotal shared the story of how a silver fox led him to his striking rune (rescued trapped fox in snare, fox dug up rune bundle as thanks)
- Alrik predicted weather using Survival check (23) - clouds coming afternoon, cold front may linger
- Lyn and Rosencrantz completed anti-Jailor weapon development

Alrik received vision from Skuld during spirit communion - saw ravens flying in unusual large flock, giant winged humanoid woman with raven wings flying toward their direction, described as ominous and "not a valkyrie."

### Entry (Aestra-Orpheus 29th Morning)

Qotal prepared four lesser elixirs of life for the party. Osanna successfully disabled the necrotic curse field by pressing the pedestal mechanism atop the skull formation, but was knocked unconscious by a positive energy pulse in the process. The party descended into carved tunnels designed for large creatures, immediately sensing strong spiritual oppression and cursed atmosphere.

### Initial Exploration

The party discovered:
- Giant-sized carved tunnels (not natural, not dwarven construction)
- Hundreds of rodent skeletons throughout the passages
- Spider snake nests in ceiling holes
- Mysterious sealed stone door that party could not open (no magic detected, appears decorative rather than functional)
- Necrotic curse field mechanism pulls energy from deep source, will reset in 1-2 days

### Combat Encounters

**Spider Snake Ambush**: Party fought multiple spider snakes using hit-and-run tactics from ceiling holes. Venomous attacks poisoned Qotal. Both Alrik and Arnor were downed during the fight. Party eventually defeated all three creatures.

**Giant Rat Waves**: Multiple waves of diseased giant rats emerged from bone pile in large chamber. Qotal contracted disease (Clumsy 1 indefinitely until cured by Aelysh or similar healer). Party defeated all rat waves.

**Necromancer Encounter**: The Fleshcrafter emerged from deeper in dungeon, dragging large pouch/cloth. When party gave sarcastic response to her questions, she raised skeleton army from bone pile and ordered them to capture the party alive.

**Skeleton Warriors**: Party faced five skeleton warriors armed with glaives in the bone chamber. Despite the creatures' resistance to electricity and piercing, the party destroyed all five through concentrated bludgeoning and spirit damage in approximately three rounds.

**The Jailor Battle**: Deep within the dungeon, the party found the Jailor stationed in a large jail cell chamber with all cells empty and open. The construct's chest cage contained no prisoners, suggesting recent victim delivery to the Fleshcrafter. Party deployed anti-Jailor bombs which slowed and weakened the construct significantly. Critical natural 1 on the Jailor's area attack saved party from devastating damage. Qotal delivered killing blows, shattering the bone cage chest cavity.

**Meat Puppet Ambush**: Nine meat puppet constructs ambushed the party from shelves and workbenches in the ritual chamber containing a swirling soul pool portal. Extended combat lasting 8-10 rounds with creatures using bouncing attacks, maggot poison vomit, and explosive death effects. Bruldin provided critical battle medicine using risky surgery on Qotal. All meat puppets eventually destroyed despite heavy attrition on party.

**Fleshcrafter Confrontation**: Final battle in the Fleshcrafter's personal chamber against the necromancer herself plus walker and crawler undead troops. The Fleshcrafter drew power from an anchored soul orb to unleash necrotic energy bursts and stupefying magic. Alrik readied Dispel Magic and rolled natural 20, reversing the orb's energy flow from negative to positive, causing the Fleshcrafter to shriek in pain and flee through a secret door. Party destroyed remaining undead troops through slashing damage and area attacks.

**Post-Battle Exploration**: With the Fleshcrafter escaped and all immediate threats eliminated, party conducted three 10-minute exploration rounds in the cursed lair before negative effects became too dangerous. Investigated stone tome, magic tomes, flayed corpses, soul pool, magic circle, and personal effects. Collected correspondence written in Necral, research materials, and intelligence about the necromantic operations.

## Stakes & Consequences

- Regional safety: Jailor has been capturing people alive, threat to all travelers and settlers
- Victim rescue: Potential captives may still be alive in dungeon
- Necromantic threat: The Fleshcrafter's operations represent major danger beyond just the Jailor
- Party survival: Currently trapped in bone chamber facing skeleton army

## Rewards & Benefits

- **Jailor Threat Eliminated**: The construct has been permanently destroyed, ending its attacks on travelers
- **Combat Experience**: Four major encounters without long rest, pushing party to resource limits
- **Intelligence Gathered**: Necral correspondence, stone tomes, magic research materials about Fleshcrafter's operations
- **Understanding of Threat**: Discovered the Jailor was merely a gatherer for far more dangerous necromancer
- **Dungeon Mapped**: Full exploration of Skull Rock's internal layout including bone chamber, jail cells, ritual chamber with soul pool, and personal quarters
- **Loot**: Various items and research materials collected during exploration (to be distributed)

## Outcome

**Primary Objective Achieved**: The Jailor has been destroyed, eliminating the immediate threat to the region.

**Secondary Objectives Partial Success**:
- Dungeon cleared of immediate undead threats (skeleton warriors, meat puppets, undead troops all destroyed)
- No living victims found - all jail cells empty, suggesting the Fleshcrafter had already processed recent captives
- The Fleshcrafter herself escaped through secret passage, remaining at large

**Ongoing Concerns**:
- The Fleshcrafter's whereabouts unknown - she could establish new operations elsewhere
- Fate of all victims delivered by the Jailor remains unclear
- Soul orb and ritual chamber left intact, potentially still dangerous
- Qotal still suffering from Clumsy 1 disease requiring cure from Aelysh
- Mysterious sealed stone doors throughout dungeon remain unexplored
- Necral correspondence requires translation (possibly by Aurelia)

## Current Status

Quest completed. The Jailor threat has been neutralized and Skull Rock dungeon has been cleared of immediate dangers. However, the Fleshcrafter's escape means the broader necromantic threat remains unresolved.
