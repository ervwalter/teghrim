# Investigate Island Dwarven Ruins

The investigation of the Island Dwarven Ruins represents a critical quest for the party, particularly [entity:7763296|Qotal] whose scholarly research led him to the frontier specifically to find this location. Discovered during the Highland Uplands Exploration, the massive dwarven structure on an island in Waterfall Lake matches both [entity:7763296|Qotal's] research images and Queen Zelinda's lore about a guardian trapped in waterfalls.

## Objectives

- Access the island ruins across 3-4 miles of open water (requires boats/rafts)
- Identify the current occupants (tents and fires observed at base)
- Explore the multi-level dwarven structure
- Investigate connection to [entity:7763296|Qotal's] broken hammer quest
- Determine the nature and status of the guardian mentioned in legends
- Understand the hob curse and why dwarves were particularly affected
- Explore caverns referenced in "cavern of waterfalls" description

## Participants

Expected to include:

- [entity:7763296|Qotal] (primary quest holder)
- [entity:7763295|Bruldin] (dwarven expertise and identification)
- [entity:7763289|Alrik]
- Potentially other party members and NPCs

## Quest Background

[entity:7763296|Qotal] arrived at the frontier pursuing scholarly research into an ancient mystery involving a moss-eaten statue of a dwarven warrior with a broken hammer. His quest has been to complete the story behind this statue and understand its significance.

During the Highland Uplands Exploration (Orpheus 5th-12th), the party discovered Waterfall Lake with a massive dwarven structure on its central island. [entity:7763296|Qotal] immediately recognized it as matching images from his earlier research, representing a major breakthrough in his quest.

Queen Zelinda previously shared lore about "a guardian trapped in a cavern of waterfalls" whose ego led to their imprisonment. King Jareth warned that "evil hearts must pay the price" regarding guardians. The hobs held deep superstitions about this structure, carving little statues of it and believing it cursed particularly for dwarves.

[entity:7763295|Bruldin] identified the ruins as a dwarven hold despite the distance and ruined state. The party observed a small encampment at the base, indicating current occupation by unknown parties.

## Current Status

## Connections to Other Quests

- **[entity:7763875|Broken Hammer Quest]**: [entity:7763296|Qotal's] primary quest, this location is the breakthrough
- **Giant Guardian Mystery**: Major progress with potential guardian encounter
- **One-Eyed Creature Mystery**: Possible connection to Genovian and the birds
- **[entity:8248776|Highland Uplands Exploration]**: Quest that led to discovery

## Stakes

- Resolution of [entity:7763296|Qotal's] primary quest motivation
- Understanding of ancient dwarven history and guardian legends
- Potential alliance or conflict with current occupants
- Access to whatever knowledge or power the ruins contain
- Understanding the hob curse and its effects on dwarves

## Warnings and Considerations

Queen Zelinda's lore emphasized the guardian's ego led to imprisonment, suggesting pride or hubris may be tested. King Jareth's warning about "evil hearts" paying a price indicates moral character may be evaluated. The hob superstition about the curse affecting dwarves particularly raises concerns for [entity:7763295|Bruldin].

The current occupation suggests others have already accessed the island, potentially uncovering secrets or awakening dangers. The party's approach must account for both the historical threats and present-day complications.

## Notable Developments

- **Orpheus 15th - The Assault**: Party departed [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing] after two days' downtime, paying [entity:8051159|Grogug] 2 gold for Mendels cake toll. Crafted blessed raft through collaborative skill checks, crossed lake at high speed using feather token fan, crashed into dock. Engaged immediately in three-way combat with grolschs and winged creatures. [entity:7763294|Aurelia's] critical Recall Knowledge revealed grolschs' fire weakness (yeti heritage). Combat paused mid-battle, ongoing.
