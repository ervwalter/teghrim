# Elderberry Procurement

A discrete procurement mission from [entity:7764102|Aelysh], the Wood Elf Grove Warden, to recover rare elderberries that were stolen by "three flying little shits" (fairies). The berries possess legendary alchemical properties and must be obtained from someone called "Old Willy."

## Quest Details

### Initial Briefing

[entity:7764102|Aelysh] needs the party to discretely procure elderberries from Old Willy. The rare alchemical plants were stolen by three fairies, and she describes Old Willy as a "lecherous geezer." The mission requires subtlety and tact.

## Quest Context

### Elderberry Properties

### Fey Politics
