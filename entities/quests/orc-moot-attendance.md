# Orc Moot Attendance

The Orc Moot Attendance quest began as an investigation into mysterious smoke and drums near an old farmstead and culminated in the party earning honored guest status at a tribal orc gathering through gladiatorial combat prowess.

## Objective

Investigate smoke and drums observed near the abandoned farm where [entity:7888222|Annie's] ritual took place, determine the source of orc activity, and navigate whatever tribal gathering was discovered.

## Participants

- [entity:7763296|Qotal] (arrived late during combat)
- [entity:7763290|Arnor Josefson]
- [entity:7763289|Alrik Grimmelstang]
- [entity:7763295|Bruldin Grimstone]
- [entity:7763294|Aurelia]

## Quest Stages

### Investigation Phase

[entity:7764100|Gierr Bjornson] reported seeing smoke rising and hearing distant drums near the old farmstead east of [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing]. The party traveled to investigate, finding the abandoned buildings intact with new plant growth where grass had been burnt during previous combat. Tracking signs revealed recent orc and goblin activity throughout the area.

### First Contact

An orc sentry fired a warning shot, then descended from his elevated position to question the party. Upon learning they were the outsiders who had fought at the farm previously, he revealed an orc moot was in progress and offered to escort them to the gathering site - an unusual privilege, as such assemblies normally exclude non-orcs entirely.

### The Challenge

Upon reaching the gathering site deep in the forest, a large orc challenged the party's presence, demanding they prove their worthiness to remain. The surrounding crowd of orcs and goblins began chanting for combat, creating an impromptu arena. [entity:7763295|Bruldin Grimstone] engaged in verbal sparring with the challenger, invoking the party's previous victories including defeating the Collector.

### Gladiatorial Combat

The party faced five opponents in spectator combat: one large orc rampager, two medium orcs, and three fire-breathing goblins. The fight used a special "pizazz" system where flashy combat maneuvers earned respect points from watching orcs. Key moments included:

- [entity:7763289|Alrik] nearly downed in the opening round, taking 42 damage from the rampager's critical hit and follow-up attacks
- [entity:7763289|Alrik's] critical battle medicine heal restoring 29 hit points
- [entity:7763295|Bruldin's] intimidating strike earning first pizazz point with theatrical declaration
- [entity:7763290|Arnor's] over-the-top electric arc presentation impressing spectators
- [entity:7763296|Qotal's] dramatic late entrance with critical trip and Babe Ruth-style showboating
- [entity:7763294|Aurelia's] critical hit bloodying the rampager

The party defeated all enemies, reaching the entertainment threshold that earned orc respect.

### The Council

As honored guests, the party attended an orc tribal council where leaders shared regional intelligence:

- **Wolf creatures** threaten [entity:7763299|Midnight Glade]
- **Hob slaves** working for unknown masters
- **Giant threat** in the region
- **[entity:7763296|Vilis Gavrik]** identified as Necarch operating soul well network
- **Cursed sites** across region connected to necromantic operations
- **Soul well mechanics** explained in detail, including creation methods but not destruction
- **Ephemeria and Black Templars** have arrived at [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing]

The correspondence recovered from [entity:8244510|the Fleshcrafter's] lair was revealed to mention [entity:7763296|Vilis Gavrik] communicating with superior "Goldgrin" about establishing sites west of Rothurst River.

## Outcome

Quest completed successfully. The party earned honored guest status among the orc tribes, establishing potential for future cooperation and intelligence sharing. Critical information about the soul well network threat was obtained, revealing [entity:7763296|Vilis Gavrik] as the regional Necarch coordinator and [entity:7763297|Goldgrin] as his superior.

## Rewards

- Honored guest status at orc moot gatherings
- Intelligence about regional threats and power structures
- Cultural understanding of orc warrior society
- Potential future alliance with tribal forces
- Knowledge of soul well network operations
