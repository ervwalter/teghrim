## Overview
Lyn Chong seeks to locate and restore an abandoned oriental shrine near Teghrim's Crossing that is rumored to possess great healing and divine power. This spiritual mission drives him from the Jade Kingdoms to the frontier territories.

## Description

### Complexity
The quest requires locating an abandoned structure in dangerous territory, understanding its original spiritual practices, and potentially gathering materials and knowledge needed for proper restoration.
