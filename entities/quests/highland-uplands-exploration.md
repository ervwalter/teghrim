# Highland Uplands Exploration

The Highland Uplands Exploration was a week-long expedition (Orpheus 5th-12th) undertaken by [entity:7763296|Qotal], [entity:7763289|Alrik], and [entity:7763295|Bruldin], accompanied by [entity:7764100|Gierr Bjornson], to map and explore the wilderness region southeast of [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing]. The expedition followed a Genovian emanation and resulted in the discovery of two major locations and multiple combat encounters.

## Objectives

- Follow the Genovian emanation southeast into unexplored highlands territory
- Map multiple hex squares in the [entity:8248775|Highland Uplands]
- Investigate any significant discoveries or threats encountered
- Return with intelligence about the region's geography and dangers

## Participants

- [entity:7763296|Qotal] (Party member)
- [entity:7763289|Alrik] (Party member)
- [entity:7763295|Bruldin] (Party member)
- [entity:7764100|Gierr Bjornson] (NPC combatant and guide)

## Quest Summary

The expedition departed from the [entity:8248775|Highland Uplands] on Orpheus 5th, with the party already having accessed the region via [entity:8051164|Grogug's Waterfall] in previous sessions. Their primary goal was following the mysterious Genovian emanation that had been observed leading southeast.

## Major Events

### Dragon Ogre Encounters (Orpheus 5th-7th)

Early in the expedition, the party discovered tracks of two four-legged draconic creatures. Initial diplomatic attempts by [entity:7763296|Qotal] failed, and the creatures attacked. The ensuing combat revealed dragon ogres—mutated ogres with draconic features and a unique energy mechanic where red glowing power manifested on their body parts, providing bonus damage on successful hits.

The battle proved challenging, with both creatures demonstrating resistance to piercing and bludgeoning damage and capability for multi-attacks using claws and tail. [entity:7763289|Alrik's] spiritual weapon proved effective, ultimately defeating the first dragon ogre with a critical hit. [entity:7763295|Bruldin's] intimidation and the party's coordinated tactics brought down the second.

### Lair Discovery (Orpheus 7th-8th)

Following victory, the party spent three days tracking the dragon ogres back to their canyon lair. The cave contained numerous pelts and equipment from a previous ogre community, suggesting multiple ogres had undergone draconic transformation. Treasure recovered included a Slick rune, Teal Spirit Apple, and various gems, which the party decided to sell.

### Waterfall Lake Discovery (Orpheus 9th)

The expedition's most significant discovery came when the party found a massive lake eight miles across, completely surrounded by mountains with waterfalls cascading from all sides. At the lake's center sat an island with substantial dwarven ruins—a multi-level structure that [entity:7763296|Qotal] immediately recognized as matching images from his scholarly research.

The ruins matched Queen Zelinda's lore about "a guardian trapped in a cavern of waterfalls" and [entity:7763295|Bruldin] identified it as a dwarven hold. A small encampment visible at the ruins' base indicated current occupation. The party noted they would need boats or rafts to access the island, located 3-4 miles from shore.

### One-Eyed Birds Encounter (Orpheus 10th)

The party encountered the mysterious one-eyed birds that had been following them for sessions. Using music taught to them by Willow Dryad, they successfully communicated with the birds, which responded by stomping rhythmically before flying away toward a distant mountain cave entrance. This suggested a connection between the birds and that location.

### Brine Drake Ambush (Orpheus 10th)

On their return journey, a Brine Drake ambushed the party at a river confluence. The aquatic creature's frightful presence, breath weapon, and ability to walk on water made it a formidable opponent. [entity:7763289|Alrik's] recall knowledge critically failed, leading him to believe the creature was weak to fire—incorrect information that hampered the party's tactics.

[entity:7763295|Bruldin] burned through multiple resolve points using Steel Your Resolve to maintain stamina. [entity:7763296|Qotal] delivered the killing blow with 57 damage from double natural 20s. The party acknowledged they were nearly defeated and would have retreated if combat had continued.

### Return to Teghrim's Crossing (Orpheus 12th)

The expedition concluded with the party returning to [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing] on Orpheus 12th. They received ordered equipment, including [entity:7763295|Bruldin's] Diplomat's Badge, [entity:7763289|Alrik's] Lesser Everair Mask (which they learned doesn't work underwater despite their assumptions), [entity:7763296|Qotal's] Pendant of Occult, and a Staff of Healing distributed to the party.
