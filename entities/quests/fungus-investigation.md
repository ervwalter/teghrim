# Fungus Investigation

The Fungus Investigation was an urgent quest to eliminate a dangerous fungal infection spreading through the forest creatures near [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing]. The infection originated from a mind-controlling myconid in a nearby cave and threatened to spread throughout the wilderness if left unchecked.

## Quest Details

### Objective
Investigate and eliminate the source of a fungal infection affecting woodland creatures before it could spread further through the forest ecosystem.

### Quest Giver
[entity:7764102|Aelysh], whose Leshy familiar had become infected after venturing into a cave where the fungus originated.

### Participants
- [entity:7763294|Aurelia] - Dhampir investigator
- [entity:7763290|Arnor Josefson] - Norn wanderer  
- [entity:7763295|Bruldin Grimstone] - Dwarven slayer
- [entity:7764102|Aelysh] - Wood Elf druid (quest giver and participant)

### Location
Small cave near an old rickety bridge in the forest surrounding [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing].

## Quest Progression

### The Call for Help
[entity:7764104|Iridessa] found the party (after being kicked out of the dining hall for using tea as a bath) to deliver [entity:7764102|Aelysh's] urgent request for assistance. Multiple woodland creatures were showing signs of fungal infection with strange growths emerging from their bodies.

### The Bridge Encounter
While traveling to the infection source, the party crossed an old rickety bridge where rust oozes emerged from between the planks. The oozes proved resistant to steel weapons, causing weapon degradation, but were vulnerable to lightning magic employed by [entity:7763290|Arnor].

### The Cave Battle
Inside the cave, the party discovered:
- A myconid (mushroom creature with tentacles) controlling infected creatures
- [entity:7764102|Aelysh's] infected Leshy familiar under mind control
- Several bugs with fungus stalks growing from their heads

The party defeated the myconid, which freed the controlled creatures from its influence. The Leshy fled once the control was broken.

### The Infection Crisis
During the battle, [entity:7763295|Bruldin] became infected with the fungus. [entity:7764102|Aelysh] immediately treated him using her cure research, having enough fungal samples from the infected creatures to complete her remedy.

## Quest Rewards

As [entity:7764102|Aelysh] had little wealth "being a druid," she provided magical items:
- An unidentified magical leaf
- An unidentified scabbard  
- An unidentified dagger

## Outcome

The quest was successfully completed with the myconid destroyed and the infection source eliminated. [entity:7763295|Bruldin's] infection was cured, and the immediate threat to the forest ecosystem was neutralized. The party's steel weapons required repair due to rust ooze damage.
