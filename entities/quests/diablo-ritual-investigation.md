# Diablo Ritual Investigation

A completed investigation that uncovered and neutralized a Diablo worship site at an abandoned farm east of [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing]. The ritual circle, created by the grief-stricken [entity:7888222|Annie] after her family's murder, was disrupted through combat before it could be used to launch an undead assault on the settlement.

## Description

### Objective

~~Investigate the purpose and scope of the Diablo ritual, identify those responsible for its creation, neutralize any ongoing supernatural threats, and prevent the completion of whatever dark purpose the ritual serves.~~ **COMPLETED**: Identified [entity:7888222|Annie] as the ritual creator, discovered her plan to assault [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing] with an undead army, and eliminated the threat through ritual combat.

### Scope

Analysis of the ritual circle and its components, investigation of the cult responsible, assessment of regional corruption, and development of countermeasures to prevent further ritual activity.

### Participants

- **[entity:7763290|Arnor Josefson]**: Occult expertise, disrupted demonic chains during combat
- **[entity:7763294|Aurelia]**: Discovered scarecrow fire vulnerability, disrupted Annie's protective mist
- **[entity:7763289|Alrik Grimmelstang]**: Force magic against orc forces, identified negative energy corruption
- **[entity:7763296|Qotal]**: Delivered killing blow to Annie, impressed orc spectators with combat prowess
- **[entity:7764100|Gierr Bjornson]**: Identified Annie, assisted in perimeter defense

## Background

What began as a search for missing [entity:7888222|Annie] revealed a dark transformation driven by tragedy. After orc raiders killed her family, Annie's desperate prayers to [entity:7763134|Avacyn], [entity:7763138|Stendarr], and [entity:7763133|Lilith] went unanswered. This divine abandonment drove her to [entity:7763136|Diablo] worship - the only deity willing to grant the pure hatred she sought. She established the ritual circle using orc and goblin sacrifices, systematically building an undead army for her planned assault on [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing].

## Quest Progress

- **Ritual Site Location**: Found in trampled wheat field at center of farm property

### Site Analysis

- **Defensive Measures**: Scarecrow guardians destroyed to reduce immediate danger
- **Environmental Response**: Wheat field burned to expose and contain ritual site
- **Evidence Preservation**: Ritual circle left intact for further study

## Challenges Encountered

- **Defensive Constructs**: Blood-fire crowned scarecrows with fear auras and piercing resistance

## Quest Resolution

### Final Outcome

The investigation successfully identified [entity:7888222|Annie] as the ritual creator and neutralized the threat before her undead army could assault [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing]. Her death disrupted the ritual magic, causing the demonic chains to drag her body into the sigil and the scarecrow constructs to collapse into ash. The party's impressive combat performance (accumulating 15 panache points) earned unexpected respect from the watching orcs, with [entity:7888223|Grabnizog] extending a diplomatic invitation for future honorable combat.

### Remaining Concerns

- The ritual site retains lingering corruption requiring religious cleansing
- Annie's theological journey highlights dangers of divine abandonment in frontier regions
- Orc diplomatic opportunity through [entity:7888223|Grabnizog's] invitation needs careful consideration

## Theological Concerns

Diablo worship represents one of the most dangerous forms of supernatural corruption, requiring extreme personal degradation to achieve. The presence of such a ritual site near a settlement poses significant risks to the spiritual and physical safety of the region.
