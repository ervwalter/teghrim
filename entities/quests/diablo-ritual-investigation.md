# Diablo Ritual Investigation

An urgent investigation into the discovery of an active Diablo worship site at the abandoned farm east of Teghrim's Crossing. This dark ritual circle, created using orc and goblin sacrifices, represents a significant supernatural threat that requires immediate attention and resolution.

## Description

### Objective

Investigate the purpose and scope of the Diablo ritual, identify those responsible for its creation, neutralize any ongoing supernatural threats, and prevent the completion of whatever dark purpose the ritual serves.

### Scope

Analysis of the ritual circle and its components, investigation of the cult responsible, assessment of regional corruption, and development of countermeasures to prevent further ritual activity.

### Participants

- **Arnor Josefson**: Occult expertise and religious knowledge specialist
- **Aurelia**: Investigative skills and tactical analysis
- **Alrik Grimmelstang**: Religious authority and divine magic capabilities
- **Regional Authorities**: Potential coordination with Teghrim's Crossing leadership

## Background

Discovered during the search for missing Annie at her family's abandoned farm, the ritual circle features the symbol of Diablo - archdemon of hatred, angst, and loathing. The site shows evidence of multiple orc and goblin deaths used to power the ritual, with some attempting to climb into the circle while others tried to escape.

## Quest Progress

### Initial Discovery
- **Ritual Site Location**: Found in trampled wheat field at center of farm property
- **Symbol Identification**: Confirmed as Diablo's mark through occult analysis
- **Sacrifice Assessment**: Multiple orc and goblin corpses arranged around circle
- **Immediate Threat**: Animated scarecrow constructs defending the site

### Site Analysis
- **Magical Detection**: Supernatural presence confirmed in ritual area
- **Defensive Measures**: Scarecrow guardians destroyed to reduce immediate danger
- **Environmental Response**: Wheat field burned to expose and contain ritual site
- **Evidence Preservation**: Ritual circle left intact for further study

## Challenges Encountered

- **Extreme Corruption**: Diablo worship requires severe moral degradation
- **Defensive Constructs**: Animated scarecrows with weapons fought to protect site
- **Regional Instability**: Increased orc and goblin activity may be connected
- **Unknown Perpetrator**: Identity of ritual creator remains mystery

## Notable History

- **The Dark Discovery**: Ritual circle found during Annie search mission
- **The Guardian Battle**: Destroyed multiple scarecrow defenders
- **The Site Exposure**: Burned surrounding field to fully reveal ritual area
- **The Tactical Withdrawal**: Forced retreat due to approaching orc forces

## Current Objectives

- Determine the ritual's intended purpose and current completion status
- Identify the individual or group responsible for its creation
- Assess potential connection to Annie's family disappearance
- Develop appropriate countermeasures or dispelling methods
- Coordinate with religious authorities for proper response

## Theological Concerns

Diablo worship represents one of the most dangerous forms of supernatural corruption, requiring extreme personal degradation to achieve. The presence of such a ritual site near a settlement poses significant risks to the spiritual and physical safety of the region.
