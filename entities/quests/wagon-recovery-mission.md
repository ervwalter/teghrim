# Wagon Recovery Mission

The Wagon Recovery Mission was a quest issued by [entity:7764097|Captain Irka Spritzel] to investigate abandoned wagons from a merchant caravan that had been attacked while approaching [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing]. What began as a simple recovery operation evolved into a rescue mission when the party discovered bulvak raiders had taken the caravan guards as prisoners.

## Quest Details

### Initial Assignment
Captain Irka reported that wagons from a large merchant train had been abandoned a few miles west of town after an attack on the rear of the caravan. She offered gold compensation for recovering goods or information about what happened. The wagons were located on the dwarven-built road approximately one to two miles from the settlement.

### Investigation Phase
Upon reaching the site, the party discovered destroyed wagons with broken wheels and scattered goods, but notably no bodies despite the evident violence. Tracks at the scene revealed bulvak involvement - demon-touched creatures from another plane known for raiding frontier settlements.

### Escalation to Rescue
Following the bulvak tracks led to the discovery that the caravan guards had been taken alive rather than killed. The party pursued the raiders through increasingly dark and foreboding woods, eventually hearing human cries of distress that spurred them to immediate action.

### Combat Encounters
The mission involved multiple combat situations:
- Initial ambush by three beast-like creatures making Tusken Raider sounds
- A challenging chase sequence through various obstacles including thick forest, misty swamp, fey territory, magical illusions, and open clearings
- Final confrontation with Gore (a large bulvak leader) and two smaller bulvaks holding the human prisoners

### Mission Completion
The party successfully defeated all bulvak raiders, with Gore and his companions slain in battle. The captured caravan guards were rescued alive, though injured and beaten from their ordeal. Upon returning to Teghrim's Crossing, Captain Irka paid the promised reward of 40 gold pieces.

## Key Participants
- **[entity:7763296|Qotal]**: Provided flank attacks and decisive strikes
- **[entity:7763294|Aurelia]**: Delivered critical ranged attacks, including the killing blow on Gore
- **[entity:7763290|Arnor Josefson]**: Supported with needle darts and magical assistance
- **[entity:7763289|Alrik Grimmelstang]**: Provided healing and combat support

## Notable Events
- Discovery of the bulvak threat to regional trade
- Mysterious observation by the [entity:7766570|One-Eyed Figure] during the final battle
- Brief encounter with strange fae creatures who mentioned someone named "Tessa"
- Recovery of gems from Gore's body (bulvaks trade in gems rather than gold)

## Outcome and Consequences
The successful rescue demonstrated the party's capabilities while revealing the ongoing bulvak threat to the region. The mission strengthened the party's reputation in Teghrim's Crossing and provided valuable intelligence about extraplanar raiders operating in the area. Questions remain about why the bulvaks were taking prisoners rather than killing them, and who the mysterious observer might have been.
