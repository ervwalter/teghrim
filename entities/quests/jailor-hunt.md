# The Jailor Hunt

A dangerous pursuit to track down and eliminate the Jailor, a massive twenty-foot-tall undead-construct creature that captures people alive in a chest cage built into its body. This colossal threat to regional safety emerged during the investigation of the abandoned farm and represents an ongoing danger to travelers and settlers.

## Description

### Objective

Locate, confront, and destroy the massive Jailor creature while rescuing any victims trapped in its enormous chest cage. The mission requires careful planning due to the giant creature's formidable defenses and capture-focused tactics.

### Scope

Track the creature through frontier territories, develop effective combat strategies against its unique immunities and abilities, and coordinate with regional authorities to prevent further captures.

### Participants

- **Arnor Josefson**: Occult knowledge specialist for creature analysis
- **Aurelia**: Tactical combat expertise
- **Alrik Grimmelstang**: Healing support and divine magic capabilities
- **Sylvia Mournhold**: Additional combat support and witness to encounter

## Background

The Jailor was first encountered after it attacked a caravan, capturing the occupants and leaving destroyed wagons. The search party tracked the creature to a forest clearing where it proved to be a formidable opponent with unique capture-focused abilities.

## Quest Progress

### Initial Encounter
- **Caravan Investigation**: Discovered destroyed wagons with missing people
- **Creature Tracking**: Followed distinctive footprints to forest clearing
- **Combat Analysis**: Identified creature weaknesses (positive energy, slashing) and immunities
- **Tactical Retreat**: Forced withdrawal when party members were knocked unconscious

### Intelligence Gathered
- **Capture Mechanics**: Creature focuses on non-lethal damage for live capture
- **Physical Capabilities**: Colossal size (20+ feet), massive strength, high-speed movement, projectile attacks
- **Magical Properties**: Cursed footprints that explode when exposed to divine energy
- **Lair Discovery**: Located at Cursed Stone Formation with necrotic force field
- **Weakness Confirmed**: Vulnerable to positive energy and slashing damage

## Challenges Encountered

- **Overwhelming Physical Power**: Twenty-foot-tall creature capable of massive non-lethal damage
- **Capture Compulsion**: Single-minded focus on acquiring victims
- **Environmental Hazards**: Cursed substance footprints pose additional threats
- **Unknown Base**: Creature's lair or resting place remains unlocated

## Notable History

- **The Caravan Attack**: First evidence of creature's presence and methods
- **The Forest Battle**: Direct confrontation resulted in party casualties
- **The Escape**: Creature fled at high speed when unable to capture more victims
- **The Investigation**: Analysis of cursed footprints revealed negative energy corruption
- **The Lair Discovery**: Party found Cursed Stone Formation serving as creature's base
- **The Failed Approach**: Nearly fatal attempt to reach central control rune due to necrotic field

## Current Objectives

- Develop effective tactics against creature's immunities
- Locate the Jailor's base of operations or hunting grounds
- Prepare appropriate equipment (positive energy, slashing weapons)
- Coordinate with regional security for wider threat response
- Plan rescue operation for captured victims

## Strategic Considerations

The creature's focus on capture rather than killing suggests victims may still be alive, making rescue time-critical. Its immunities require specific tactical approaches, while its cursed abilities pose environmental dangers to any pursuit team.
