# The Jailor Hunt

A dangerous pursuit to track down and eliminate the Jailor, a unique undead-construct creature that captures people alive in a chest cage built into its body. This threat to regional safety emerged during the investigation of the abandoned farm and represents an ongoing danger to travelers and settlers.

## Description

### Objective

Locate, confront, and destroy the Jailor creature while rescuing any victims trapped in its chest cage. The mission requires careful planning due to the creature's formidable defenses and capture-focused tactics.

### Scope

Track the creature through frontier territories, develop effective combat strategies against its unique immunities and abilities, and coordinate with regional authorities to prevent further captures.

### Participants

- **Arnor Josefson**: Occult knowledge specialist for creature analysis
- **Aurelia**: Tactical combat expertise
- **Alrik Grimmelstang**: Healing support and divine magic capabilities
- **Sylvia Mournhold**: Additional combat support and witness to encounter

## Background

The Jailor was first encountered after it attacked a caravan, capturing the occupants and leaving destroyed wagons. The search party tracked the creature to a forest clearing where it proved to be a formidable opponent with unique capture-focused abilities.

## Quest Progress

### Initial Encounter
- **Caravan Investigation**: Discovered destroyed wagons with missing people
- **Creature Tracking**: Followed distinctive footprints to forest clearing
- **Combat Analysis**: Identified creature weaknesses (positive energy, slashing) and immunities
- **Tactical Retreat**: Forced withdrawal when party members were knocked unconscious

### Intelligence Gathered
- **Capture Mechanics**: Creature focuses on non-lethal damage for live capture
- **Physical Capabilities**: Massive strength, high-speed movement, projectile attacks
- **Magical Properties**: Cursed footprints that explode when exposed to divine energy
- **Current Status**: Escaped with full chest cage, location unknown

## Challenges Encountered

- **Overwhelming Physical Power**: Creature capable of massive non-lethal damage
- **Capture Compulsion**: Single-minded focus on acquiring victims
- **Environmental Hazards**: Cursed substance footprints pose additional threats
- **Unknown Base**: Creature's lair or resting place remains unlocated

## Notable History

- **The Caravan Attack**: First evidence of creature's presence and methods
- **The Forest Battle**: Direct confrontation resulted in party casualties
- **The Escape**: Creature fled at high speed when unable to capture more victims
- **The Investigation**: Analysis of cursed footprints revealed negative energy corruption

## Current Objectives

- Develop effective tactics against creature's immunities
- Locate the Jailor's base of operations or hunting grounds
- Prepare appropriate equipment (positive energy, slashing weapons)
- Coordinate with regional security for wider threat response
- Plan rescue operation for captured victims

## Strategic Considerations

The creature's focus on capture rather than killing suggests victims may still be alive, making rescue time-critical. Its immunities require specific tactical approaches, while its cursed abilities pose environmental dangers to any pursuit team.
