# Von Carstein Mansion Clearing

An urgent contract from [entity:7764097|Captain Irka Spritzel] to clear the [entity:7764198|Von Carstein mansion] of undead threats before its new vampire owners arrived. What began as simple property maintenance evolved into discovering the troubling expansion of [entity:7764192|Von Carstein vampire house] influence into frontier territories.

## Quest Details

### Quest Giver

[entity:7764097|Captain Irka Spritzel] and [entity:7764196|Rosencrantz]

### Initial Briefing

Clear the abandoned [entity:7764198|Von Carstein mansion] on an upstream island before the new owners - [entity:7764193|Osanna Von Carstein] - arrived between the 12th and 14th of Aestra-Orpheus. The elaborate estate had been built by a previous commander twenty years ago, finished seven to eight years past, and stood empty since its creator's death two to three years prior.

### Objectives

- Clear the mansion of any threats
- Secure the property for the new owners
- Report findings back to the captain

## Quest Progression

### Initial Preparation

The party received the assignment on 10 Aestra-Orpheus, with a two-day preparation period before the mission. Party members used this time to pursue personal interests and gather resources while [entity:7764196|Rosencrantz] provided mission details about his [entity:7764199|laboratory] on the southern island.

### Mansion Assault

The party traveled by boat to the upstream island mansion on 12 Aestra-Orpheus. Upon approach, they encountered:

- Waves of skeps (small undead goblin-like creatures) erupting from the grounds
- A necromancer on the balcony raising reinforcements from fallen enemies
- Seemingly endless undead reinforcements requiring sustained combat

### Combat Resolution

[entity:7763296|Qotal] executed an aggressive leap attack onto the balcony while the party engaged in coordinated ranged combat. The combined assault eventually eliminated all threats, including the necromancer leader who had been reviving fallen minions.

### Discovery Phase

Inside the elaborate estate, the party discovered:

- Expensive furnishings revealing the previous owner's wealth
- Secret passages containing valuable magical loot
- Correspondence revealing [entity:7764193|Osanna Von Carstein] as the new owner
- Documents confirming the [entity:7764192|Von Carstein vampire house] expansion from [entity:7763172|Astoria]
