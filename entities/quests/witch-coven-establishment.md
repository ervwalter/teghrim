# Witch Coven Establishment

[entity:7763290|Arn贸r Josefson's] personal quest to establish contact with or create a witch coven at [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing]. After finding no existing practitioners at the [entity:7764201|Hades shrine], the Norn witch has begun placing markers to attract potential magical contacts.

## Quest Details

### Quest Initiator

[entity:7763290|Arn贸r Josefson] - Norn witch seeking to establish magical connections

### Background

During the party's downtime at [entity:7763187|Teghrim's Crossing], [entity:7763290|Arn贸r] investigated the presence of witch covens (rolling 18 on investigation). His search led him to the [entity:7764201|Hades shrine] built into the settlement structure, maintained by the Church of [entity:7763137|Pharasma]. Finding no existing practitioners, he placed witch marks at sunset to signal his presence to potential contacts.

### Objectives

- Continue placing witch marks at appropriate locations
- Monitor for responses from potential practitioners
- Establish contact with any existing magical practitioners
- Potentially form a new coven if no existing groups are found
- Build a network of magical support in the frontier

## Quest Context

### The Hades Shrine

The [entity:7764201|Hades shrine] serves as a focal point for death-related spiritual practices, with people leaving coins hoping Hades will shepherd their deceased loved ones' souls. Its maintenance by the Church of [entity:7763137|Pharasma] suggests organized religion's presence but not necessarily witch traditions.

### Cultural Considerations

As a [entity:7763211|Norn] practitioner, [entity:7763290|Arn贸r] brings foreign magical traditions to the frontier. His collaboration with [entity:7764194|Sigrid] on planning the Old Lughnass festival (September 22nd) shows efforts to maintain cultural practices while building new connections.

## Current Progress

- Investigated local magical presence (successful)
- Located [entity:7764201|Hades shrine] as potential gathering point
- Placed initial witch marks at sunset
- Checked on familiar [entity:7763867|Natvig]
- Awaiting responses to markers

## Potential Outcomes

- Discovery of hidden practitioners in the area
- Attraction of wandering witches to the settlement
- Formation of a new frontier coven
- Uncovering of magical threats or opportunities
- Integration of Norn magical traditions with local practices

## Quest Status

**Active** - Markers placed, awaiting responses
