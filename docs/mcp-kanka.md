- **Batch Operations**: Process multiple entities in a single request
- **Posts Management**: Create, update, and delete posts (notes) on entities
- **Markdown Support**: Automatic conversion between Markdown and HTML with entity mention preservation
- **Type Safety**: Full type hints and validation
- **Client-side Filtering**: Enhanced filtering beyond API limitations

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Kanka API token and campaign ID

```

## Quick Start

### Adding to Claude Desktop

1. Set up your environment variables:
   - `KANKA_TOKEN`: Your Kanka API token
   - `KANKA_CAMPAIGN_ID`: Your campaign ID

2. Add to Claude Desktop config:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kanka": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "mcp_kanka"],
      "env": {
        "KANKA_TOKEN": "your-token",
        "KANKA_CAMPAIGN_ID": "your-campaign-id"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Using with Claude Code CLI

```bash
claude mcp add kanka \
  -e KANKA_TOKEN="your-token" \
  -e KANKA_CAMPAIGN_ID="your-campaign-id" \
  -- python -m mcp_kanka
```

## Supported Entity Types

- **Race** - Species, ancestries
- **Note** - Internal content, session digests, GM notes (private by default)
- **Journal** - Session summaries, narratives, chronicles
- **Quest** - Missions, objectives, story arcs

## Available Tools

### Entity Operations
- `find_entities` - Search and filter entities by name, type, tags, date range
- `create_entities` - Create one or more entities with markdown content
- `update_entities` - Update existing entities
- `get_entities` - Retrieve specific entities by ID with optional posts
- `delete_entities` - Delete one or more entities

### Post Operations
- `create_posts` - Add posts (notes) to entities
- `update_posts` - Modify existing posts
- `delete_posts` - Remove posts from entities

## Search & Filtering

The MCP server provides enhanced search capabilities:
- **Content search**: Full-text search across entity names and content (client-side)
- **Name filter**: Exact or fuzzy name matching
- **Type filter**: Filter by user-defined type field (e.g., 'NPC', 'City')
- **Tag filter**: Filter by tags (AND logic - entity must have all specified tags)
- **Date range**: Filter journals by date
- **Fuzzy matching**: Optional fuzzy name matching for more flexible searches

Note: Content search fetches all entities and searches client-side, which may be slower for large campaigns but provides comprehensive search functionality.
