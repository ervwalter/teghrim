# Kanka Context Information

## What is Kanka?

Kanka is a collaborative worldbuilding and tabletop RPG campaign management platform. It helps game masters and worldbuilders organize their fictional worlds, track characters, locations, and storylines, and share this information with their players.

## Core Concepts

### Entities
Everything in Kanka is an "entity" - a piece of information about your world. Think of entities as wiki pages or database records that describe the people, places, and things in your fictional setting.

### Entity Types Available

- **Characters**: The people who inhabit your world
  - Player Characters (PCs): The heroes of your story
  - Non-Player Characters (NPCs): Everyone else - shopkeepers, villains, quest givers
  - Historical figures and legendary heroes

- **Creatures**: The non-humanoid beings and monsters
  - Monster templates (e.g., "Dragon", "Goblin")
  - Animal species
  - Mythical beasts
  - Note: These are creature *types*, not individual creatures (use Characters for named creatures)

- **Locations**: The places in your world
  - Cities, towns, and villages
  - Regions and kingdoms
  - Buildings and landmarks
  - Dungeons and adventure sites

- **Organizations**: Groups and factions
  - Guilds and companies
  - Governments and nations
  - Religious orders
  - Criminal syndicates

- **Races**: The species and ancestries
  - Playable species (Elves, Dwarves, etc.)
  - NPC races
  - Cultural groups

- **Notes**: Private information for the game master
  - Session planning notes
  - Secret plot points
  - Behind-the-scenes information
  - Default to private (only visible to campaign admins)

- **Journals**: The ongoing story
  - Session summaries
  - Campaign chronicles
  - Important events
  - Player-visible narratives

- **Quests**: Missions and objectives
  - Main story arcs
  - Side quests
  - Character goals
  - Campaign objectives

### Entity Components

Each entity has:
- **Name**: What it's called
- **Type**: A subcategory you define (e.g., a Character might have type "NPC" or "Merchant")
- **Entry**: The main description - the "wiki page" content about this entity
- **Tags**: Labels for organization and filtering
- **Privacy**: Whether players can see it or only GMs

### Posts
Think of posts as additional notes or comments attached to an entity. Like adding sticky notes to a character sheet or location description. Useful for:
- Session-specific notes
- Updates and changes
- Additional details that don't fit in the main entry
- Player theories or GM secrets

### Entity Mentions
Entities can reference each other using a wiki-link style syntax:
- `[entity:1234]` creates a link to entity #1234
- `[entity:1234|the ancient sword]` creates a link with custom text

This creates a web of interconnected information about your world.

## Use Cases

Game masters use Kanka to:
- Build and document their game worlds
- Track NPCs and their relationships
- Manage locations and maps
- Plan and record game sessions
- Share world information with players
- Keep secret notes hidden from players

## Campaign Structure

A Kanka campaign is a complete game world or story. It contains:
- All the entities (characters, locations, etc.)
- The relationships between them
- Private GM information
- Public player-facing content

Think of it as a private wiki for your tabletop RPG campaign or fictional world.

## Search Capabilities

When working with Kanka through the MCP tools, you can:
- Search for entities by name or content
- Filter by entity type (character, location, etc.)
- Filter by tags and custom types
- Find journal entries within date ranges

This makes it easy to find information across your entire campaign world.
