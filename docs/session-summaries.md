# Session Summary Generation

## Purpose

Create concise, scannable overviews of each session that highlight key events, decisions, and outcomes. Summaries serve as quick reference documents for players and GMs.

## Input

- **Source**: Completed session digests
- **Length**: 5-20 pages of structured content
- **Format**: Chronologically organized events with entity tags

## Process

### 1. Information Prioritization

Extract the most important elements:
- **Primary**: Major plot developments, character deaths, quest completions
- **Secondary**: New NPCs met, locations discovered, items acquired
- **Tertiary**: Combat outcomes, skill check results, minor interactions

### 2. Narrative Condensation

Transform digest entries into summary points:
- Combine related events into single bullets
- Focus on outcomes rather than process
- Preserve causality and consequences
- Maintain chronological flow

### 3. Structure Creation

Organize into consistent sections:
- **Overview**: 2-3 sentence session capsule
- **Key Events**: 5-7 major happenings
- **New Discoveries**: NPCs, locations, information
- **Party Decisions**: Choices and their implications
- **Rewards**: Treasure, experience, achievements
- **Cliffhanger**: Session end state

### 4. Entity Highlighting

Ensure critical names are prominent:
- Bold first appearance of major NPCs
- Italicize new locations
- List important items explicitly
- Note faction affiliations
