## Session Overview
- Date: June 20, 2025 (Aestra-Orpheus 14th; waning gibbous after full moon on the 12th)

- Outcomes: Multiple Bolvok skirmishes, mid-session chase, two human captives rescued, salvage delivered to Irka; bronze bull pendant and low-grade cold iron bec de corbin recovered

## Chronological Events

### [00:00:00–00:24:30] Town Prep, Quests, Gear
1. SCENE: Breakfast planning; active leads noted (Gaz delivery, abandoned wagon recovery for Irka, elderberries request, shrine restoration, basilisk rumor, statue research).
2. ITEM: Identify dwarven clan dagger (+1 potency rune). Rune transferred to cold-iron rapier; rapier tempered/repaired (approx. 4 gp service); loaner/backup blade discussed.
3. RULES: Downtime/friendship system reviewed; calendar/moon phase set to waning gibbous.

### [00:24:30–00:41:30] Downtime & NPC Visits (same day)
4. ACTION: Qotal visits Aelish via acorn; confirms nature-focused specialty, scientific curiosity about plants (whip of thorns noted).
5. ACTION: Aurelia leans toward duelist Sylvia for training/social; Arnor schedules evening religious event in woods (post-sunset).
6. NOTE: Stamina/resolve reset rules clarified; minor table chatter about familiars and learning paths.

### [00:41:53–00:48:59] Next Morning; Departure West
7. SCENE: Team decides wagon recovery is time-sensitive; Irka will reward scouting/recovery but wants items returned (not free scavenge).
8. TRAVEL: Follow dwarven road a few miles; find multiple smashed wagons; no bodies on scene; boxes broken and emptied.
9. TRACKS: Horses fled separately; clear hooved Bolvok tracks; signs of humans among tracks.

### [00:49:05–01:05:00] Site Recon, Threat Assessment
10. SURVIVAL: Confirm Bolvok behavior (herd-oriented, territorial; sometimes trade; can be violent seasonally). Debate whether attack pattern is typical.
11. EXPLORATION MODES: Assign roles—Track (Survival), Scout (Perception +1 initiative), Search, Avoid Notice (use Stealth for initiative). Dense, hostile forest ambience set.

### [01:10:52–01:18:30] First Contact (Skirmish 1)
12. CONTACT: Bolvok scouts visible ahead; additional yelps deeper; human cries audible.
13. TACTICS: Stealth repositioning; one poor hide roll exposes approach. Initial ranged/melee maneuvers; spacing larger than prior “abomination” fights.
14. COMBAT: Mixed actions (shields raised, flanks attempted). Finish off last foe with bludgeoning hit (22 to hit → 6 damage) before screams prompt immediate pursuit.

### [01:40:01–01:55:10] Captives, Chase, and Intercept (Skirmish 2)
15. DISCOVERY: Spot larger Bolvok dragging two chained human captives; two smaller carriers with heavy packs attempt to flee.
16. CHASE: Structured chase through thick forest; obstacles cleared via Survival/Athletics/Fortitude sprinting. Strong Athletics rolls carve path; party closes distance.
17. ENGAGE: At intercept, bigger “Gore/Ungore”-styled leader and carriers drop chains/packs to fight; initiative rolled. Mid-fight battlefield medicine guidance discussed.

### [01:55:10–02:26:30] Resolution, Medical, and Loot
18. COMBAT: Extended melee; notable actions include needle darts “porcupine quills” to eyes; downed ally stabilized; risky surgery used (damage then high heal roll net positive); hero points awarded during session.
19. RESCUE: Two human captives freed (beaten, starved for days). Note to record identities later when available.
20. SALVAGE: Gems recovered (locals trade in gems more than coin). Bronze bull pendant identified; cold-iron bec de corbin (low-grade) from fallen caravaner recovered for party loot/sale.

### [02:32:20–02:38:40] Return and Debrief
21. SIGHTING: One-Eyed shadowy watcher (bat/raven-like, single large eye) observed in tree; “natural yet not natural”; disappears without flying—possible scrying/occult tie.
22. HANDOFF: Report to Irka; receive gold for effort/recovery; identify/sort items; pendant’s shove-boosting talisman effect noted; polearm earmarked for sale.

## Notes & Follow-ups
- Next likely quest: Gaz’s delivery (team expresses interest not to delay).
- Open threads: elderberries request; shrine restoration; basilisk rumor; statue research; One-Eyed watcher investigation.
- Admin: Record names of rescued caravaners; consider entity posts for pendant and chase site; add gem values to party loot ledger.
